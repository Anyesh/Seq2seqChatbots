i went to a movie and she was really a really good singer . it was a good game but i do n't know what to say .
i 'm so sorry . i did n't know that . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i feel like it .

ok . wait a minute .
what about this one ? it is very popular in the refrigerator .
blue .

all right . thank you .
it looks like the weather is so good .
is there anything else i can do for you ?
yes . let me help you .
thanks . that 's very kind of you .

i want to have a look at your resume .
i 'm not sure which one is good for you . it 's a popular dish .
i 'm not sure . i do n't like it very much .
yes . the fitting room is right over there .
how much is the fare ?
i 've been having problems with my boyfriend .
do you have any particular size in mind ?
what 's the price of this package ?
it 's a <unk> . it s size 41 .

oh hi mary . you must be very careful .
it 's right .
yes we have a full range from here . we can take a look at the menu . do you want to see it ?
i am afraid there are n't any problems .
yes there is a big one on the left .
i think it 's the same .
you 're welcome .
what 's the fare ?
yes it 's right .
here you are .
it 's just around the corner .
very well . i do n't want to go there .
you 're welcome .
i think it 's a little far to walk .
i see . i 'll do that .
well the thing is that all i have to do is to get into the computer and then go to the movies .
oh what a pity .
but you know i 'm just looking forward to it .
i know what you mean . i have to go now . i 'm going to bed early .
well it 's hard to say . but there is a lot of people who do n't know how to do it .
no i 'm not . i 'm sorry but i 'm not a big one .
it is too much for me . i like the food . they are very delicious .
it is only about forty dollars .
i guess you 're right . there are some <unk> i can do . i do n't like it either .
don t worry . the only thing that is the best way to do .
i guess not at all . but i do n't think it 's too much for the environment . i have never been to the environment too .
you are really lucky . you should be able to find a taxi that is not the right .
she asked me to give you an appointment for a week .
well it seems that i have to think about it . but i do n't know what to do .
that 's true . she is a very good teacher and i do n't think he 's very happy with it .
well i do n't think that 's a good idea . i think it 's too much to be a <unk> . but i do n't think he 's so much better than him . he 's so cute and really funny .
yes . it 's a <unk> .
cool cool . what is it ?
yes . it was a great game . we had a great time . we had a great time . we had a great time ! we had a great time !
is that so ? i thought you had an excellent choice .
but it seems that the people who are good at the same time as they are in love or not .
of course there 's a point of that . there are some people who are trying to find out about how to use the computer and the computer will do .
that 's good . let 's go .
i do n't know .
no the little thing is that most of us are going to be our pleasure .
well we have two different types of chinese food .
i have no idea .
i go to bed at my house .
that 's great . i 'll take it .
sure .
yes i am . i 've been studying for my own . i m not sure how long i can find a job that is more expensive than my current job .

ok . you should be able to fix the correct amount of the contract .
you mean we 'll have to pay for the next bus .
yes i agree . i will take the house .
ok . i 'll wait for you at the next stop .
i am sorry . mr . baker is not in . may i take your message ?
no i do n't think so . i ve got an appointment with her .
you re welcome .
let me see . it 's one hundred and twenty yuan .
i think it 's a little expensive .
yes we do .
would you like to try my best ?
this is the best i 've ever been to do . i do n't need to worry about getting a new one .
but i am not very busy at the moment .
ok . we 're going to have a picnic with my friends .
sure . we should probably get some from the cafeteria .
that 's a good idea . let 's go .
that 's a bit too much for me . i 'm not sure that there is one thing there 's always so much to do .
fine . i 'll bring a bottle of wine .
i know you 're right . but what do you want to do ?
i do n't think it 's a bit too far from the mall . do you want to go there ?
well if you do n't mind me asking how much you 'll have to pay for it .
fine . i 'll wait until you get back .
yes which is the subway stop ?
i think we 'll get a bus pass .

it ca n't be that bad . if you do n't mind sharing room with the other two weeks there 's one thing .
i wish it was but i did n't realize it was so much better than the last one .
really ? i never thought that there 's nothing to do with the problem .
do me have a try . it 's a little different . i do n't think we have any other things too .
ok we will .
when i first got home i was in the park .

that 's good . have you been there before ?
no he did n't .
oh that 's right . he 's really handsome .

you are not going to do anything else ?
ok . we will send you a ticket .
i 'm glad you like it .

oh you mean the one i like the green one ?
ok . we ll be in touch .
our price is not as high as the price is very high .
yes that 's the most expensive .
i know that you have a lot of problems with the internet .

that is fine .
but thank you very much all the same .
how much does it cost ?
i 'm not sure yet .
which store are they ?
no i 'm not . what 's that ?
a good thing you have to do is to get a good impression on the interviewer .
i have no idea what i want to do .
when would you like to start with me ?
i agree . i ca n't wait to see it . it 's a good thing i have to do .
but i still have the right to turn right on it .

but i just want to know how to use the internet . she is a very good person .
oh she can make her own decisions .
i guess you are right .
i will take the next bus to the right .
i hope so .
but yesterday you said you would be interested in your future .
i ve changed my mind .

i do n't know what to say to the movie .
maybe you re right .

she is beautiful .
is she old or young ?
she is quite young and her hair is blond .
is she strict ?
not really . her eyes are blue .

i m sorry . i can t hear you .

i m sorry to hear that .

what else i ve got to do ?
who knows ! that might be the best for you .

dreadful . there s the one who had the right to go .
thank you .
no i m sorry to hear that . what about you ?
no i did n't . i 'm still a little . . .
i think that is true .
yes it 's very nice of you to say so . but i do n't like it . it 's very kind of you .
i see . well the thing that 's the best we can do is to make a reduction .
i want to transfer 100 .
sounds good . i think i can take the two . how much is it ?
there is no doubt that the car is a little tight .
ok .
you should n't have to go to the movies .
i 'll try my best . i know a good job . but i can always do it if i have a chance .
sure . you can reach me the next few days and then go to the hospital .
i 'm sure you will love this .
yes please .
that s right .
i see . what 's the problem ?
that 's right .
is there a big one ?
hey you 're right . i love music .
if the kids were in love what they would do is to be a good thing .
why do n't you try it on ?
ok .
i see .
hey let 's go to the bar and buy some friends .
you are right . let 's go to the estate office and see what they can do . i 'm sorry .
that 'll be fine .
right . that s a good idea . it s a very important thing for you to have a child .
hey ! i like the fish !
it does n't matter . i will try it .
no one of the other people have n't . it 's a good idea to buy a new one .
i can only do it in three weeks .
yes sir . we do n't have any receipts for 225 .
well i 've put a check on the computer and the computer lab for a while . i 'm not sure if it is possible .
what kind of currency do you want to get ?
well . i think we should do something about it .
let me see . yes i have your credit card and i can do it now .
it does n't matter . i 've been looking forward to this for a long time .
that s great . we can do it after the first shipment .
the only thing we could do is to make a big deal .
i think that 's the best way to go .
i 'm afraid that the price is not too high .
alright sir . what would you like to have today ?
i 'd prefer a cup of coffee .
i 'm sorry but i 'm not in the mood for it .
you do n't have to pay for it ?
you are absolutely right .
the first thing is that the most important thing is to do that . i think the idea is a good thing . you should get some good marks .
what 's your plan ?
what did you buy ?
yes i would like to make a reservation .
certainly sir . what can i do for you sir ?
sure that sounds great ! what is the problem ?
not at all . no problem .
i like it . i prefer to do that .
yes of course . we can provide you with a credit card but you can have a look at the bank of the bank .
i need to make a list of things like that .
do you like this kind of necklace ?
yes i have some hobbies .
i like the design but i prefer the fish .
i 'll have the kitchen ready to take your order .
you know what 's going on ?

i believe you are about it .
it sounds like a large pan of water .
yes .
i am ready to get my license .
not yet . i just have a bad cold .

i like that but i like the design .
this one is a good choice . it is very popular among your products .

we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .

i could try that on . now what is it ?
yes . i ve come to talk with you about the sales department for this position and we can go to the office .
that s great ! i m not surprised . i think the government should be able to fix it that way . the first thing is that all the people have to read the book before they were in the same .
no we re all the same . we ve been looking for a few more days now . we ve got to get a lot of money in the city centre . there s a lot of competition in the city . we re also going to look for some of the problems .

what 's your date of birth ?
it 's a special rate . i 'll take this one .
i ll be glad to help you . it s a good thing you can t make it .
why not ? i don t think you are a good choice . the food there is a lot of good choices .

i will ! i ll be going around tomorrow .
what if we want to go to the movies on saturday ?
ok . i ll get a burger and a bottle of wine .
we re planning a little more relaxed and relaxing . i don t feel comfortable with any other friends but i don t think we have any other plans .

it can t be long enough . i ll have to take a look .
that 's a good idea . i will try my best to do some things for the first thing .

i am not sure of what i want to know .
you re right . i d like to see it .
the owners will not have the best .

the check out .
i think that 's a good idea .
you can t take that long enough to make sure that you have to pay the rent .
i will .
i 'm afraid there are n't any problems .
what did you do that ?
thank you for shopping here .
it 's not easy to find . i just want to find a place to live in .
thank you very much .
i have no idea .
what is the problem ?
well they ve got to be careful .
i would like to do that .
i will be glad to do that .
i believe so .
we have a few different types of french and i would like to have a small collection of large pizzas .
what happened ?
that s fine .
i 'm pretty good . how about you ?
are you sure you re going in the wrong direction ?
i need to return a book .
yes you can help .
that 's a good idea . i 'll try it .
it s a little expensive . i don t think it s a problem with your bedroom .
i can do that .
yes but if you have any questions just call you .
that would be perfect .
ok . see you then .
ok we 'll be expecting you at 7
yes . it is a very good place for me .
it 's a pity that i can t afford it .
your clothes are very well .
what would you like to drink ?
i wrote the check out for 100 .
i would like to see the doctor . if i don t have to pay for it .
i will be able to take the subway .
you should have told me you were going to be there .
oh well i guess you 're right . but i still have to get back to my office .
you did n't know that ?
yes i think the best way to go there is the best way to find the best .
i would like to be able to help you .
what are you going to do about it ?
the rent is 1 . 5 dollars per day .
that s pretty expensive .
here is my money .
i think so . i ca n't afford to pay for it .
it is a little higher than the others .
what is your problem ?
how much is it ?
that s right .
okay mr . horn see you tomorrow at 1030 .
i could n't believe it was a very good choice . it was the most difficult period i have ever had .
i was hoping that the first thing was a major <unk> .
could you please fill out this form ?
when is the meeting ?
if you were involved in any other position you would feel better .
are the most important thing in the countryside ?
of course . if you want to withdraw money from your account you can get them fixed .
that 's a good idea .
i got a new car and a new project . i had a good time .
your owners will be ready to start a few minutes .
ok what will i be there ?
do n't worry about that . we should get them ready to start the <unk> of the day if we have any .

i 'm sorry to have you taken the wrong box .
are you looking for some dessert ?

i want two hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
are you sure you want to buy a ticket for that one ?
yes we are going to have to work for a long time .

how much is it ?
that 's it .
yeah i was hoping we could come out and have a look at the menu first .
let 's get started and we 'll have it ready for you .
what would you like to have ?
i think the idea is that the most important thing is that the kids do is good .
well let 's get a look . the computer is the best we can do .
sounds good . what 's the matter with you ?
i think i 'll have a good idea .
what 's in the refrigerator ?
it 's got a small color and i like it so much .
that sounds good .
ok . how about some fried chicken ?
that 's good . i like the style .
i think i 'll have a glass of wine .
ok .
i would n't think so .
you 're right . that 's why we 're talking to people who are n't talking about our family ?
what would you do without me ?
what kind of shoes ?
let me see . . .
i see . you can say that the price is very popular .
the price is too high for the price . i 'm not sure how long it will take to make a look at it .
well we can see that for our first class next month .
i have a little <unk> but i think it 's better for a doctor .
no . how about this one ?
that 's right . but it is hard to find a way to find a way to find a place to make more people like that .
oh ! i 'll tell you . . . this is a nice day and i can t remember if i had a bad one .
i 'll try the one .
alright . i 'll take this one .
i like the color .
sure we can try the best .
i 'll take care of it .
i want some chocolate .
how about your hair ?
you sure will .
you re a little nervous .
i want to make a list of all the things i want to do .
what would you like to drink ?

the chicken is very nice of you to say so . you 'll have to wait for a while .
would you like anything else ?
i do n't like it very much .
yes . i 'll have a glass of juice .
well this is the first thing we 've got all day . we need to see your passport and how many pieces of your luggage can be in the box .
ok . how about the one ?
the cake is absolutely right ! i do n't like the fish .
i am glad you are right .
yes . there are about 20 kilometers of these ones .
i 'll try it .
ok . i 'll try them .
i 'd rather have it with my wife .
yes . i have n't been able to have this class with me .
oh that 's too bad . what about your hair ?
i can t wait until tomorrow .
i 'm not sure if i can .
i know . i just ca n't help it .
i have no idea .
there is a big one that i like to use .
well i 've got it . i 'll take one .
i 'm not sure yet .
i 'm glad you like it .

one or two ?
i got on the first bus .
ok . i 'll have to cancel your ticket and i 'll be back in a minute .
i 'm not sure .
we could n't wait to come in for a few minutes .

well then i can do it if you do n't mind . i 'll take it .
we are . we should have some great time together .
i really hope we can come again .
you mean the one with the other one ?
it 's only a tenminute walk .
do you think we 'll be able to travel by train or by bus ?
i have been there for about three years .
what time did you go to university ?
i do n't think so .
if you have any other questions just give me your name and phone number .
but the only thing i can do is to make a decision .
how about this one ? it 's a very popular brand of art .
i really enjoyed talking to you .
you 'll have to get off at the next stop at the end of the month .
i 'm going to make sure to get my license .
sure .
the first thing is that all i can do is to make a decision in the next few days .
oh well . i 'm going to do some exercise .
that sounds fine .
i 'll try to make it .
well how about the flight ?
oh no . we have been working there for three years .
is 900 in the morning and a week ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't .
what kind of software do you want ?
i want one with a large view of the latest ones .
it 's a letter from nyu .
which one do you prefer ?
the one that looks really good .
what kind of soup would you like ?
yes that 's right .
what 's the matter ?
i mean if you do n't sell your shares now it s quite a bit . you ll see it .
that 's what i said .
yes you can do that . but you can use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television .
i have already been able to get it fixed .
ok . i 'll make sure you get a new one here .
i am not sure yet .
no there is no need to be .
ok . i 'll take it .
sure . we have n't got enough money yet .
yes there are some <unk> .
i see . but i have no idea .
why ?
but i want to get back to work .
no i do n't think it 's a good idea .
i 'm ready . i 'll be back in a minute .
you should 've been late too .
will there be a problem ?
yes we can do that .
i 'm glad you 're ready .
okay . i 'm going to go with you .
i 'm just going to have to stay in bed for a long time .
i 'm not sure if you like .
i will . but i 'm going to work for the next day .
i do n't want to argue with you .
i 'm not sure i 'll be able to help you .
how long will you be staying ?
i live in the haitian district .
you can catch the bus .
how much is the fare ?
yes it 's so quiet here .
ok . i 'll wait for you .
you can take it from the bank or just give you a transfer .
i guess i can do that .
you should have got it .
how long is it going to take ?
no problem .
how long have you been looking for this apartment ?
i do n't know . i do n't know where i can .
i 'm sorry but it 's not far away . i have to go .
i 'm afraid i ca n't .

if there 's nothing else i can do about it .
take the no . 2 .
how do i get to get there ?
i 'm not sure . let 's go .
thank you for your compliment .
no problem just go ahead .
i 'm not sure .
it 's a little too expensive .
well we are all going to eat but we 're not allowed to pay for it .
how do they go for the food ?
yes . this is the latest model .
maybe . but i ca n't see it .
it 's a small plus .
what is the price of the whole ?
why not ?
yes . they 're all handmade .
usually you can use them for a few minutes .
it does n't look like a little expensive .
i am going to the hospital .
it 's on the west side of the campus .
how about going to the theatre ?
i think it 's a good thing .
i think so .
how about your family ?
let me see . oh yes . here you go .
i 'm sorry to hear that . but i 'm afraid it 's too difficult for me to find a place to live .
you should also take some medicine and make sure that you are the right person .
yeah . it 's not like you just want to be a planet with a problem in the city .
i m not sure about that .
what 's the problem ?
i 'm not going to take the subway .
well if you have any questions just let me know .
i 've been thinking about it for a while .
i 've got a few too .
do you know where it is ?
you have to put it on your computer for the first turning on your left .
i see . do you have any other questions ?
you do n't know how to play ?
you should n't have to .
you 're welcome .
then when will you be here ?

it was my wife .
what was the score ?
it was 3 to 4 but it was a very nice match .
i ll be glad to help you out .
i don t know what to do .
how about this car ?
i think that the government should give me some money to my money and i do n't want to pay for it .
i think you re right .
i ll have to go now .
i don t think so .
i know what you mean . i have to do my own job and i m not sure how to do it .
i am sorry but i have no problem .
i ll just get it for you .
well how about going to a movie tonight ?
we get off at the next stop and walk around the corner .
i 'm glad you like it .
i 'm really sorry to hear that .

i do n't know .
you should have told me about your new job .
i do n't know . but i can t believe it .
how about the subway ?
yeah it 's hard to believe but it does n't work .
we have to make sure we have to be there .
i just hope you can stay in bed for two days .
no i think so .
here is the money .
yeah i 'm going to go to the movies on saturday .
i 'm afraid not .
it 's a little about a month .
what is the weather in london ?
i know .
i 'd like to go there by myself .
yes . it 's a very famous hotel in the city .

i 'm afraid it is n't too late .
we get off at the airport and see if there is a big stop .
how long does it take to get there ?
yes but there is a lot of traffic there .
you should go to the top of the stairs to make sure that you have to find a place to go .
i 'll give you a hand .
i 'm afraid not .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
i 'm really sorry .
i think i 'm going to have a look .
i think we should be able to make it .
how about a movie ?
i do n't know . but i 'm afraid i 'm not a clockwatcher . i do n't know what to do .
i hope so .
yes .

thanks for your help .
i had been feeling pretty well for the last few years .
it was great . we had a great time . we had a great time .

i will like to leave for the next few days .
yes it is . we will send you a new one and you 'll see what they want .
thank you .
oh no . it 's my favorite .
what do you think is the best way to get to her ?
i will try my best .
i have a problem with the doctor . i 'm not sure if i 'll be able to find my own .
yes you should have a parttime job in the school and a company car .
really ? that 's a good idea .
yeah . . . well it is so hard to believe that people are not in the right direction . i think that is the most important thing to me .
who are the most important ?
we could use it for a while but they were only for the most expensive . it was not for the same thing . it was a very good game for me .
i think the government should be very pleased with the climate .
you should think about your words . you are a good learner .
i think you re right . i have to pay more attention to the environment and more expensive than the others .
yes .
that sounds interesting .
it was about 40 years old . it was a very exciting place to live . the only thing was that i had been looking for a long time .
i see .
they 're actually over there but they 're only about two weeks .
in china and the city is very crowded in the city centre .
yes . and i do n't like it very much .
i see . they have the same kind of chinese in chinese restaurant .
they were n't very good .
i see . what did you do after that ?
here we are .
a very good idea .
it was at the first time in college .
what was the score ?
some of the countries are the same . they were very good at the same age .
i think that the idea is to find out about the city before we go to the city .
the most important thing is that the people who are good at the same time in the country .
in the city . we always do some time in the spare time .
if you have your experience with me i can help you find a job that is a good job .
i see . and what about the other terms ?
how about your family ?
i was working in a very busy school .
so what did you do ?
i think so .
do n't worry about it . i 'll give you a call when you 're back .
i like to study english literature .
really ? how long have you been to this company ?
no i did n't .
i think it 's time for you to get a walk .
do you have my name ?
how did you do that ?
he 's the most handsome person i 've been looking for for years and he is not in the mood for his job .
i see . by the way what do you do there ?
all the things i needed to do . i was in the mood for some chinese and then i needed it in the past . i was very excited about it .
you may have a good point . you should n't be able to find your way to your computer .
i did n't agree with him . he 's a good person to help him .
not really . the only thing i do n't have to worry about .
i can help you with that .
if you think i 'll just go and get a raise .
nothing special . i just lost my wallet .
hey i 'm a little worried about my job . i 'm just asking .
i 'm just trying to find a new job .
me too . i guess i can do that . what do you do ?
how about the meeting ?
i 'll give you a call . if you can just give me a call if you 'll just let me know .
what do you think about our company ?
i 'm going to the doctor . i have to go back to the doctor .
like this once in a while . it 's not fair .
i 'm not sure yet .
how about some fish ?
yes sir . i 'll be back in a minute . here 's your passport and my credit card .
i mean if you do n't sell your shares now it s quite a bit . you ll see it .
well you have the taste . it 's not like you 've been here for almost two years . you 've got to wait for a while .
thank you for your compliment . i am sure they will do well in the same as the future .
well i like to play the piano for me . i like to play the piano for a while .
if your parents do n't like it they can do it .
that sounds great . but i ca n't help it .
yes we 're lucky . it 's a very good place to go .
yes we have a great time . what do you think we should do about that ?
you 're a great idea .
nice to meet you lvan . my name is alike . i 'm from japan .
to me english is a difficult language . how much is your favorite ?
a second language is always difficult .
true but english is harder than most . it is a long time .
a crazy language ? why do you say that ?
one letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .
no wonder you say english is a crazy language .
pretty well . i just got back from a week .
how did you feel ?
i got married and i was born in beijing .
what does your job have ?
to be honest i like most of them except for the future . i like the most important thing .
i think the guy was too good to know anything !
it was pretty well . he had a lot of bad experience .
i think she is a bit nervous . what about you ?
she is in the hospital with my wife .
i see .
i was not really sure about it .
it seems that she is pretty good to know what 's going on .
i do n't think so . i think she would be very happy .
ok . let 's go .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we 'll need to get some rest .
you see that your wife is a good boss .
how about this one ?
i hope so .
no but she said she 'd be back in a few weeks .
oh i guess so .
i felt that the most important thing was that i did .
why do you want to be an interpreter ?
she was a very good girl .
well i guess you 're right . what do you think about her ?
i was reading about how many people who are getting on the financial floor . i am interested in some of the activities in your country . i am sure they are good at what you are doing .
i want to go to the movies .
i do n't know . maybe we can find some good things .
i am not sure whether i can do that .
not really . she was a good friend . but i do n't know what to say .
well i guess you 're right . but i still have to get rid of them . i would n't have to think about it .
i bet she is . she is a pretty <unk> and she has been very helpful .
is she a child ?
i don t have a lot of children in front of people . i think it s a good idea to get a child or some people . but the reason that they are not so happy .
oh i see .
she 's a pretty short girl . i do n't know what 's her name .
wow ! how did you know that she is a good teacher ?
yes but i like them very much .
they can be good for each other .
you know what ?
you ca n't help learning when you 're using it all day . you know it 's hard to learn a lot from the internet .
i hope so .
oh she likes to me . she is a good person for her to help her .
you know what if she is in love with you and your boss will make you feel happy .
that 's the new teacher .
what do you think of the teacher ?
she 's very nice .
what does she teach ?
english of course .
is she your teacher ?
yes . she is very tall and slim .
can she speak chinese to her students ?
not very much .
it 's a good thing you can speak english !
yes i did .
you re very lucky .
well yes . i do n't know what you mean . i 've already got a flu . i 'll take it .
well what are you going to do now ?
i plan to go to the movies with my friends .

i 'm going to work in the library .
that 's fine .
hi linda . i have n't seen you for ages . how have you been ?
what do you think of the new teacher ?
i have no idea how i am going to take the course .
you are a bit young . but not everyone is not as good as you know . but he is a hard time not to mention his hair .
i guess so .
i think they are important . they are the most popular stories in the world .
why do you think so ?
i have no more than public .

i think so .
i have a lot of working experience in this field .
they are supposed to be very different from other countries .

no more than a few weeks .
there are hundreds and hundreds . english is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions .
can you give us an example ?
i 'll look up the matter .

that is just a natural grammatical english expression . it has a direct translation in other languages .

i think you 'll like the house .

you are not going to be late . but i have to get up early tomorrow .

we don t like it because we have a lot of good quality . we have many different kinds of products in spring and countries . we also have to think about the products in the market .
you are absolutely right .
what 's the difference between the two ?
what is it ?
you can always find a place to live in .
we 'll just take it .
i 'm sick of it too .
the door bell does n't work the sink is leaking there 's no one left .
it 's no use complaining . if we had got to get it done then .
sure .
how could i do that ?
but you should get more rest .
ok . i ll try my best to be more careful .
oh i am sorry . i m going to have to take a look .
it s all right .
i ll take it .
i was in a hurry too .
yes . when i was at the beginning of the meeting you did n't tell me you were looking for .
i understand .
she didn t have a bad headache .
poor girl !
not much . i have a bad headache and my nose is ill .
what 's the problem ?
i was just taking a walk through the internet .
for example ?
for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
no i ca n't wait that bad . i 'm sure she will do well . what 's your favorite color ?
it 's not just that . i do n't know what to say . i mean the company wo n't even have to pay for the phone or the personal .
my grandmother used to do that is really exciting .
i see . but the <unk> is n't that bad .
she told me she was very happy with her . she 's a really good friend .
that 's great . you know what i think is that our father is in line with his boss .
but i am happy with you .
no i went out of the office .
i really do n't know .
that s fine . i m going to go to the library . i ll have to go over the details and get back to you tomorrow morning .
yeah . . .
what ?
it s ok .
i m afraid i m not sure .
me too . i can t believe it .
i m sorry . i don t know where that is .
i saw him in the wrong direction . he was just coming .
i 'm not sure .
no one would be perfect .
thank you for telling me .
do n't be so sure about that .
i don t know . i think that i should be more careful about how to keep fit . i think that is the best way to make things the same thing .
i m sure you can do that . what kind of books do you like ?
i have no idea .
i can only wait for you but i don t have enough money to eat .
it s too bad that they are too big . i don t think i d like to be able to do that .
you are right . we will be able to find a good price environment on the internet .
why don t you find a new job that you are interested in ?
what do you need ?
maybe you have a job in the future . i will help you find a job .
it 's nice but it 's so much better than mine .
you 're right . i love the color and the color of my old style .
you must n't be kidding .
where it is ?
it 's a very famous world .
yes i know . but i am not really worried about this .
yes i 'd like to buy a ticket to new york .
sure . do you want to send it by ordinary or registered mail ?
i think i can help you . what do you think of this one ?
what do you think is the trouble ?
in boston .
do you have any plans ?
here you are .
thank you . how much is it ?
so we can do this first .
what about your mother ?
what do you think of the future ?
i 'd love to .
come on don t be too hot ! just let me know that you are going to have a good time .
and then you can go to the beach with the friends .
no . i ll just have to write it down .
what 's that ?
why do you think you are qualified for that ?
it is a very easy figure . i can help you find a person s best for you .
that s right . we can go to the beach and enjoy the fresh air .
i do n't know . i do n't know .
well do n't worry about it . just give me the chance . i 'll call you later .
actually i think i 've ever had it in a good time .
do n't worry . i do n't have any other ideas to eat .
you 're right . i guess that 's what i just do n't have to do .
well are you going to the right direction to the park ?
what is it ?
it s a surprise . i have no idea how i am going to take the bus .
sure . i like to know what it 's on sale .
how about this sunday ?
ok i 'll be expecting you .
i 'll see you then .
no problem .
i am sorry i ca n't .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't you ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
but i have to go now . i 'm going to have a try .
i did n't think you 'd be happy .
i ca n't agree with you more .
sorry i did n't know . i did n't think of that .
oh you 're right . you 're all the same .
i am not in the mood .
why are you feeling depressed ?
i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . it s a real letdown .
i do n't think she would do such a thing .
but she did and she did n't know that she would never do such a thing .
oh cheer up ! a girlfriend is not everything .
but she means a lot to me .
then forgive her mistake .
oh i just can t .
do n't worry about it . just keep your promise of yourself .
no . it s not far away from the job .
i 'm sorry but i 've got all my credit card .
no problem . i 'll do that .
i was thinking of getting a little more sick . i 'm a little more excited about this .
yes i like playing the piano .
what 's the weather like in your family ?
oh no . i 'm not surprised .
what about the weather ?
ok .
i 'm afraid we ca n't .
you 'll have to get used to it .
do n't worry . i 'm sure you 'll enjoy it .
well i guess so .
which do you find most ?
of course .
how about taking a walk in the park ?
it 's a great idea .
i think the color of my opinion is that the most important thing is that the world is not good enough .
can you tell me how to get the done ?
maybe you 're right . but there is no difference .
what 's the matter ?
you 're a student teacher .
i 'll try to get it .
no i 'm not .
how about the quality of the top ?
i would prefer a red wine with a bath .
all right . may i have your name please ?
ok . i 'll have a look at the menu first .
anything else ?
i am sorry . i am sorry but i can t find out if you could get another room .
do n't worry about it . we have to get off at the last few days .
thanks for your advice . i 'll talk to you later .
well that 's all for you .
oh yes .
i heard that the people in the internet is a good idea to get a new one .
i know you 're right . but i still have to wait for a long time . i 'm not really worried about this . i 'm just going to have to get my license .
maybe . i 'll try .
i 'm very well thank you .
really ? what 's it like ?
now that i know i was worried about how i am going to be late .
oh that 's right . it 's a long time to go . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
well he had to get rid of the things and she got lost with his son .
what did you have in mind ?
i know but i was just worried about how i can . i 'm going to be a little more relaxed in the future .
you know she 's a hard worker . you know that i really have to be an interpreter .
well i think you 're right . i think we should get together and get some rest .
well in that case i guess i could get a promotion . i 'm a bit worried about this .
yeah i 'll call later .
that 's very kind of you to say so . how much do you want to spend ?
great . how many people are there in your party ?
do you like it ?
i have no choice .
good choice . i can smell alcohol on your breath .
the price is very high quality .
yes . you 're right . but you should have some good ideas .
we will try to make it if you want .
oh what 's that ?
well i have to get to the hospital in a few days now .
why not ? it sounds like a good idea .
ok here 's your money .
give me a second .
cheers .
i 'm going to the beach with my friends . what are you going to do ?
i am going to the library . let 's go .
we are sorry but we are fully booked on that day .
yes . he s going to the hospital .
i m not sure . but i m afraid the government can t pay me attention to the price .
why do n't we go for a walk ?
because he is n't very tall and he does n't have any sense .
well what happened ?
yes and i 'm very happy with you .
he must be very happy .
you know he was in the mood that you could think of a good person . he s a little older .
you got it .
i was told that it was n't a bad time .
you should n't be so sure . he is always busy with his friends .
oh come on . this is the first time .
what are you talking about ?
yes but i was thinking of getting a little more old .
looks like you re going to have to wait for a long time .
i can t believe it ! i thought i was going to go to the movies .
what were the odds ?
20 to 1 in the u . s .
too bad .
what is it ? what happened ?
i think someone is stalking me .
no it ca n't be . what time does it start ?
i do n't know . i saw him the first time he was at the first sight . he was just thinking about how clever you were .
what did you do ?
i stood behind the register and took a couple of weeks .
did he leave when you left ?
yes . then i left my office at the airport and i left the office .
what did you do ?
that 's about five blocks . and around corners too . so he was definitely following you .
yes he was . i 'm not sure he was just a quick guy . i made a mistake . i was just waiting for him .
actually i do n't think you can call the police . not yet at least . he has n't done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it . but if you had any question just let him go and see what you mean . it would be a shame . but if you want to get her something you can t just let him go .
why ca n't i call the police now ? he was definitely following me !
of course you can have a try .
i suppose . what can i do ?
listen carol . do n't let this happen . i 'm going to get her some time off .
alright . and i wo n't go to that cafe for awhile .
of course . we are all out of stock .
oh ? what 's that ?
well you know how to use it . i mean you have a good time .
what 's that ?
black .
i had a great idea . i was wondering if you would like to go out again this afternoon .
i know but i 'm not really worried about his hair .
perhaps . he is a good person . he likes to get rid of his clothes but he 's not so easy .
that 's what i am thinking . i am thinking of getting a job as a job .
yes .
can you come in for a second ?
i 'm afraid we ca n't .
let 's see . . . the bus stop is right there .
i believe you are right . there are a few things that i can do .
i hope so .
have you ever been to the university ?
come on in .
they just send them to the <unk> <unk> for their <unk> and their rights .
how much is it ?
you can take the rest of the course .
it 's too bad . i did n't know that they did n't have a good time .
i was robbed .
a private school is a good idea . they are a good choice . they are very supportive .
i 'm sorry but i 'm not sure if i 'll be able to find something else .
that 's the only way to go .
i like the beach and the food is very good .
i 'm glad to hear that .
hey i hope it 's not the same .
that 's not bad . but i do n't know the name of the city but it 's not too expensive .
this is a gift i want to see . . .
i 'm not sure .
we have n't . i like that . but we do n't have much time for us to do this .
my god ! so i went to the car and we went to the beach on saturday .
i really enjoyed the job .
i would like to do it but i would n't be able to make it a long time .
yes i have the same .
that 's right .
how about the one together ? it 's a lot of fun .
well i guess so .
i think we have the same .
i went to the cafeteria and then i was a little confused . the plot was too late . i was so nervous . i didn t know what to say .
yes it was a great place to go . i think we have the same thing .
yes . i was thinking about getting a promotion .
yes .
well i 'm not sure .
do you have to work for a long time ?
well they ve got to be careful .
if you want to order a room i 'll put it in a storage room .
no i 'm not sure yet .
that 's very good . do you have any other questions ?
i have a good memory .
you know mr . white . he s just a couple of weeks ago .
so what did you do ?
yes sir . we 'll be there in a few minutes .
do n't worry about that . i will call you later .
hello tom .
i 'm sorry but i 've already got a few tickets to go .
oh i 'm sorry . but i do n't know .
it 's been a long time !
i want to know how to use it .
yes .
ok !
well i 'm just asking . i 'm going to the hospital . i 'm going to have to keep my car now .
why ?
i was thinking of getting a little more sick . i 'm a little more excited about this .
have you thought about the job ?
no .
ok . you should be able to fix the correct amount of the contract .
you got me .
are you sure ?
i 'm not sure .
i 'm not sure .
so what do you want to eat ?
what time he does n't like to go ?
pretty good . i 've been busy lately .
that s very kind of you . but i am not sure i am going to be a great time .
me too . i think we should have some more information about it .
well i ve been here for several years .
really ? so what s the problem ?
you mean the news that you really want to go out ?
you have to be careful about it .
he 's in the hospital in the hospital .
he is really good .
ok . what do you want to know ?
well i 'm afraid it 's not for your mother .
it 's thursday today .
what happened ?
the boss said that it was a long time ago .
i know what you mean . i mean we do n't have any trouble with his hands .
nothing much . i 'm going to the library .
not really . i like playing the piano .
does the sound of good food here ?
yes . i heard that there was a real <unk> in the computer which was n't as good as it is a <unk> .
wow . so how much is it ?
yes . he was a very good man to do .
of course . i love the music . and the music is so beautiful .
sure . it 's one of the most famous in america .
yes i went to a play in the southern of the city .
really ? that 's wonderful . did you go to the movies on saturday ?
that 's right . i did n't really like the music . i do n't know what to do .
but i do n't think the same thing is that i 'm not ready for the job .
yes . he was the best man in america .
well . he is really a good man .
i 'll go and get it for you .
i know . i just don t know what to do .
yes i am .
of course i did but when i first met him i was a kid .
he had a bad accident .
did you do anything wrong ?
sure . how about the one with the latest digital ?
yes there is no . the kitchen is so fresh and fresh .
yes . the only thing i did n't like to get there .
really ?
i think the most important thing is that the people who are willing to pay the rent and the amount of money .
no i have no idea .
yes . there are some articles on the screen . i do n't want to see it .
and there are more people who do n't think that there are too many people .
well you can get off at the first stop and walk around the corner .
i was in the bank with a gun .
i 'm afraid not .
after a while i 'm waiting for my wife and i 'll be back in a minute .
ok . i 'll see you then .
i 'm not sure .
what do you want to eat ?
i want to buy a new computer .
yes please .
i see . but i think that is a good idea .
it 's a small kitchen and a small bathroom .
but i like the design and i am very interested in this style .
i 'm going to the hospital .
you can take a look at the front of the door .
it is interesting . i can use the computer and the internet to be a lot of money .
yes . you are lucky . but you should n't go to the supermarket .
hmm i do n't think that 's a good idea . i 'll take it .
i know what you mean . i mean it 's a lot of qualified people .
ok i know . but you know that 's the problem .
well . . . how about the one with the latest pan ?
it is a great deal .
no . it 's a <unk> .
i 'll take this one but i do n't have any other information on the internet . i 'm sorry i ca n't .
i like the novels of dickens very much .
how about this ?
well they all worked hard at the end of every day .
i know what you mean . i 'm not sure i 've seen it before .
i 'm not sure . i just ca n't bear to dance .
i 'm sorry . i do n't know what to do .
i guess i should try to find a good job . i am a beginner .
ok .
sure what 's up ?
bye .
i 'm so glad to hear that . she 's a good girl .
well she was in the mood that she did n't give me any money .
yeah we can get together and celebrate it !
sure . i will .
well i guess the teacher is a great team . they are very supportive . i am a member of a team player . i believe that i should learn how to do the best of my life .
what was your major at college ?
it 's been about the most expensive .
is it difficult to find a job that is a real <unk> ?
i do n't know . i do n't know what 's wrong with it . but i do n't know what 's wrong with it .
oh really ? that 's interesting .
yeah . and that s what i want to say .
when is he your boss ?
it 's hard to say . but the most important thing is that the work is suitable for you .
he 's a teacher .
what 's your idea ?
he 's not as good as he can .
how can i get it ?
it was my pleasure .
wow you are so kind . i love you so much . i love you so much and i love you .
the time of departure will be up to your class on friday .
i 'm not sure if i 'd like to .
i know it is always hard to get used to it . i do n't know what to do with it .
it sounds quite a great idea .
is it ? i 'm not sure if i did n't like it .
for example an article has been to a <unk> for its own country .
that 's true . some people use their own computer games to do their work . if you do n't have to worry about it .
actually it 's not the fault of the service . but if there 's anything else i can do to help you with it .
but what do you do now ?
i guess so . i 'm not sure i 'll be able to find my own .
are they still in your room ?
thank you for your advice . i 'll try my best to say something .
oh that 's too bad . where did you go ?
why not ?
no problem .
yeah . the pollution and the environment is not too expensive .
but what are the pollution pollution in the city ?
they could provide you but of course the most of the people will be fined .
well i do n't think that the most important thing is that the goods are good . they do n't have the same thing .
yeah . they are many trees and many people . but after that many people have no time for them .
but what about the software ?
they are not very popular .
i see . the only thing that 's the reason is that we have to pay for the second one .
sure it 's a total of 20 .
you 're not going to do any more exercise ?
i 'm working hard .
you should be a bit more careful .
nothing really .
what is your name ?
well i quit and gained it back .
that sounds good . but i 'd like to do something different from my home .
well as a matter of fact i have a lot of questions to make . i hope you 'll be able to make it a lot of time .
what do you think of the future is good for our company ?
i think it 's the best way to find the best . they are very good and they have the same opinion .
wow what 's that ?
but we have some new furniture in it .
i mean the <unk> in the same thing or my parents wanted me to do that .
i guess most of the characters on the characters is that i have no idea of how they were in their country .
really ? but you have to think about it .
oh i 'm afraid so . i 'm not a big fan of them .
you have n't come to the right places and we have to go to the supermarket .
i m not sure but i will be expecting you .
how about tomorrow at the earliest we can go ?
when did you find it ?
me too .
ok . bye .
not at all . i do n't know . i 'm a really good fan of tv . and i also like to listen to classical music .
i 'm sorry to hear that . what did you do there ?
i know i 'm not so worried about that . i just do n't know how to use it . i mean it is n't that hard to find a job in the city .
that 's true . but i am not sure whether the company is that right ?
i 'll have to write you a ticket and suspend your driver 's license for 3 months .
oh . i see . you are right .
good afternoon ! can i help you ?
i 'm fine thanks . how about you ?
hi mr . smith .
pleased to meet you too .
yes .
why did you ask your company to pay for it ?
i will . thank you very much .
a movie . i was a member of the basketball team .
i see . well what did you do there ?
how did you like the game ?
i liked it . it was a very good game .
yes the food was good but i was wondering if you had any luck with the price .
you are not going to be late for school ?
i am worried about the future .
i guess it was too cold for me .
is it really cold ?
well . i 'm really looking forward to it .
you can make it a little later .
i am afraid i ca n't make it .
yeah . let 's go and have a look .
what 's the problem ?
really ? that 's great !
i do n't know . i never really like it . i just like going out .
well we have some new furniture .
i do n't know .
that s fine . i 'll bring it back in the morning .
thank you .
hello is that stefan ?
yes it is .
i 'm afraid i ca n't find the ticket . i have to go now . i 'm afraid i have to be a problem .
ok sir . for what time ?
what am i supposed to do ?
i 'll see you then .
let 's just go .
good . i 'll pick you up here tomorrow .
my name is david .
sure . what can i do for you ?
would you please ask him to call chris when he gets back ?
well that 's good . i will call you later . what time would you like to leave ?
how about your family ?
i know but you know it 's hard to say . but not to be honest .
i know . i think it 's a little too expensive .
do you like it ?
before he made the mistake i was ready to go to the top of the stairs to the right .
it 's a little different . let me show you the way . there is a big car nearby . it 's the only one we can do on the second floor .
hey ! i 've been thinking about getting some medicine for a while . i 'm too busy .
let 's just take a look . it 's the most expensive .
i 've got it . i 'll have to try my best .
they 're really beautiful .
can you tell me where the office is ?
what 's the weather like in winter ?
he 's got a great time .
you know we should n't do that .
that 's right .
i went to a movie with my boyfriend .
i agree . i guess we have to get there in a few minutes . i 'll be right back .
no i did n't . but i do n't like them very much .
how long does he have to do that ?
i went to the cafeteria and bought it but my wife was really sick . i was so nervous . i didn t know him .
i see . well there are two people who are very good at the movies and they are very nice .
well at least i had a great time .
that 's a great idea . so what did you do yesterday ?
i see .
the team team .
but i think the government should do it .
but the only thing is that i feel the same way .
then what about your daughter ?
he is in his hometown .
and after that ?
i hope that the food is great .
it sounds like the same .
but how many are you in ?
what do you think of the most important thing ?
are there any difference ?
it 's a <unk> song and we 're not sure to hear about it .
i suppose but i ca n't find the food there .
wow ! i think the biggest thing is that we do n't have any other ideas ?
i am not sure .
sure . here you are .
you 're right but i do n't know what to say .
i like the most of the ones . i like the most popular sports sports basketball .
and you should play sports too ?
yes i do . i play basketball very well .
i wish i could eat a lot .
that 's a good idea .
not much . last night i met the last few days .
i 'm sure you 'll be fine . i hope you can stay in bed today .
well . he is a hard worker . you know he 's a very nice person .
well it seems you 're not going to be really interested in doing it . you know the rules in the city is very good .
there 's nothing definite i think . i do n't have a list or anything but when i first meet my parents i will be a successful guide .
well that 's something i 've never heard of . but if you ask me how to do it i should make a decision .
i agree . you ca n't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . there are some things that we can do .
yeah i know . i should go and get a new one .
i like playing the piano .
that 's fantastic ! i love chinese food .
i like pop music . do you ?
how about you ?
i am afraid i can t .
maybe you 're right . but i still have to think about it .
yes . it is a good deal .
i like to play basketball .
i 'm afraid that too . i do n't like the food . i 'm sure you do n't like the food . what do you think ?
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really ? that 's great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he was a great man .
oh it 's love at first sight . when will you be getting married ?
he did n't say but he said he would call me .
maybe he is busy with his work .
oh steve . . . i guess i m not going to be angry with you . i just want to get my new job !
you can ask her out for a few days after work .
thank you steve . you 're right . but you 're right .
that 's what i am doing .
thank you . it 's a lovely day . i 'll take it . thank you for your help .
i am sorry to hear that . i ll have to put you in a few minutes .
that 's the man .
oh you 're lucky . she is so encouraging to her .
let me tell you the truth . it 's my treat .
you 're right .
yeah i know . but i still don t know what to say to the movie .
yeah ! and how do you know ?
yes i know . but i 'm not so good at all .
does it ever work ?
i saw it in the store . it was in the same boat .
what kind of volunteer ?
well i like the most of the movies .
i 'm going to visit the famous wall .
it 's the most expensive .
i 'll take care of it .
sure . what kind of food would you like ?
hey it 's not the same . i 'm glad we 've been looking for a walk .
yeah . i am a junior and i am not good at doing that .
oh no . i did n't know what happened .
i think it is a good idea to have a walk in the kitchen .
yes i am .
not much .
this is a big one . i do n't know . i do n't like it . it s very nice and i have to wear it .
i m not going to be late . i have to go now . i am going to be late .
i 'm afraid we 're going to get married .
but i prefer the hot air .
ok . how much is the ticket ?
do n't worry about it .
wow ! what do you think of it ?
i 'm just not in the mood for some kind of work .
really ? how about your mother ?
oh yes . it was so crowded . i went to the hospital in the morning and i had a cold .
why not ?
what did you do last time ?
how about your family ?
what are you talking about ?
i 'm very sorry .
i know ! i just want to do something like that !
no . he was n't in the mood to see any of his friends .
i want to know how to use this computer .
oh did he hurt ?
well i had to look at my car . i was n't thinking .
oh that 's too bad . what did you do ?
yeah . he was a <unk> .
i 'm glad that you know that we are going to have a great time .
that s right .
oh how do you do that ?
he is . he does n't know how to speak his english .
i must have told her that she was a little worried .
i am not sure .
nothing . i had no idea .
oh yes he was so nice .
and he is so handsome .
yes . it s a long way to go .
right . it was a terrible match .
well i got to go and see the doctor .
do n't be so pathetic . it 's a <unk> game .
yeah it 's so hard to say . i think the most important thing is that i 'm going to have to take a look at the market before the interview .
yeah . he 's a teacher . but he 's really nice and friendly .
you 're right . but i do n't know what to say . there is no need to worry about .
yeah i had to wait until i was told . it was so nice to see you again !
not bad . how about you ?
hey look at these books .
of course ! we are all going to eat and enjoy the food .
i do n't think it 's a good choice to be a problem . the performance is so different .
i 'll do that .
that 's good news . i know what you mean . i 'm not sure if i 'm in a hurry .
we 're thinking of going to a movie . we could have some fresh air for the summer .
oh i see .
no but i haven t been able to find a job that is just what i want .
that 's a shame . maybe we should try to find a place to get some time to work .
i 've got a bad cold and i do n't know what to say .
are you sure ?
well i had to look at my car and we got married to get married .
so what are you going to do ?
yes . it s a long way to go .
oh that 's right . what did she do ?
i 'm a teacher .
i 'm glad you like it .
i 'm just trying to give you a hand .
did you go to the police ?
i just wanted to have a try .
do you think we can get her a message ?
yes i know .
that 's not bad . just give me your credit card and we 'll give you a discount .
i have n't had time to help me .
i am a journalist . i have to write about the cost of my own company .
how about your mother ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you . this is a very difficult place to do .
it 's half past seven .
well there 's nothing wrong with it .
oh i guess i 've got it .
where are you going to go ?
i do n't know . i was so nervous . i just got back from the store . i did n't know what to do .
thank you .
what 's the fare please ?
if you need any help with that in order to get your phone number .
no way . i do n't like to know what 's that for .
of course not . i 'm just not sure .
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
i 'm sorry but i ca n't find the final . i 'm sorry but i 'm not sure if the color is a little too heavy .
well what about the surrounding city ?
but thank you very much all the same .
yeah i did n't know what to say .
yeah and they 're very lucky .
you really should have been too late .
it 's ok .
what else did you do ?
yes .
i do n't really think so . i 'm afraid he 's not the right person to ask for any help .
you can just go to the park with the first floor .
oh right . so what s the matter ?
the one on the top of the stairs i told you to go to the top of the zoo .
wow ! what a pity !
yeah he was a psycho .
is he ok ?
i 'm sorry but he is n't in his mood today .
i guess he s not too bad .
the man and he gave me a lot of money and he was so nervous .
yeah .
why do n't you go to the police ?
i hope you did n't make any plans for the next weekend .
the boss just told me that they were supposed to be late for dinner and we had to be late .
yeah i just got them . they are my own .
what are you talking about ?
i m a bachelor s degree .
yeah you re a pretty good idea . i m not sure .
oh yeah ? which team ?
the rockets .
really ? i m surprised .
all right see you later .
we are going to look a little bit over . what s more the weather is like this .
how hard is the climb ?
it is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .
what did you do last week ?
we rappelled down the side of a foot cliff . it was very exciting .
wow . that sounds like a lot of fun . i am really sorry . i did n't know that .
well you should come here with me . i think you should go and see what you eat .
yeah i will .
ok see you !
i 'm just watching tv .
i 'm so hungry .
me too . do you think we can get together with a friend in the office ?
i do n't think so . i think we should be able to find something more expensive .
that 's right . what do you think we should do ?
that depends on what you like to do .
i like to play the piano for fun .
yeah that 's a good idea .
i think so .
that 's a great idea . i 'm glad to hear that .
oh we went to the beach with my friends .
that must have been wonderful .
well we went bungee jumping when we were in the world . we had a great time last week .
wow ! that sounds great !
a little but the sun is so fresh .
tell me about it .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
500 feet ! i would never be able to do that .
yeah it was scary but exhilarating .
i guess so .
he is really a very good man .
i have no idea .
yes we can . and i also want to know how to use the computer .
i maintain that we should be more careful than we 're going to start with .
i saw the last one with the king . it was built in the right but it was quite close .
i know the point . it 's not that much of the pollution but it 's not too bad for your environment .
yeah . there 's nothing about the difference . but i do n't have any worms .
yes but i do n't think so .
really ? i ca n't wait to see the other . it 's about the same thing .
that s right . i think it s a good idea to pamper yourself and make a quick impression to me .
yes that does sound very nice of you .
why are we so many things ?
yes it 's a very pleasant family .
that is great . but people do n't think that they are just as good as they are .
they go to the cafeteria and go to the cafeteria .
that sounds great .
that 's the most famous . i think it s not very good in the public .
i 'm not sure yet .
i see . i have my own car now . i 'll take it .
oh . . . and there is a beautiful country .
i 'm not sure .
but it 's a good idea to have a good chance to see them .
well it 's a little too far away .
they are such a big fan of them . they are so cute .
wow ! what a great idea !
no doubt that it should take a long time .
i ca n't agree more .
certainly .
well the contract is out of stock . so what can i do ?
yes of course . but i think it 's a way to find a place to make a big deal with a contract .
i see . what about the surrounding side ?
maybe i can see that . it is very convenient and the way to make the rent of a computer .
i really appreciate the help .
that 's true . but the government is a higher than most of the people who have to think about it .
what about the jeans ?
i can just tell you what we 're talking about . we 've got a few problems .
i 'm afraid there 's a lot of room .
what do you have for today ?
it will be fine .
i see . thank you .
you bet .
yes . that 's true . and the people who do n't understand the results .
of course i can .
how do you like it ?
i think it 's a good idea to get some of the people in the city but they want to make it .
all right . what time would you like to order now ?
just fine .
here you are .
thank you . i 'll take care of it .
let 's see . we have the same time .
many of them are the national stories in australia .
it seems that it 's a lot easier to do .
well your friend has a very good reputation . we should consider a team of our team who will be in the future .
i see . it seems that the people in america have become a good way for their children .
you 're right . i am glad you 're doing .
yes i have some water for my wife .
let me see if i can .
i think so . we 'll have to wait for a few minutes .
would you like to have a look at it ?
so do you want to go to the movies ?
yeah . it is a kind of thing .
it 's a lot like me .
it is just a little like it 's because it 's so popular in this world .
have n't you ever heard !
yes . a . . .
the news is n't very good .
oh yes . i think you are the right person .
i hope you will be happy to see him again .
no not at all . it 's a good idea to be a <unk> player .
are you sure ?
yes we can find some good ones but we also have a lot of fresh choices .
it 's amazing . some people will think about how to do it .
you are right . i think we can find something about it .
good for your time . and what about you ?
in most people go to school every year .
i see . how much do they cost ?
no . it 's not only that but the price is very high . it 's not that much .
oh yes . i think we should get together and buy a new one .
sure . we should also provide a special retirement plan for our environment .
one hundred yuan .
i am sorry . i m not in the mood for it .
ok . i will take it .
oh i know what you mean . i 'm just going to do it .
yes i am . i am going to the hospital .
why do n't you try it on ?
i mean the <unk> in the same thing or my parents wanted me to do that .
oh . . . well that 's why i am impressed .
he 's really easy to learn and to learn english .
they are right .
yes we can eat more than that .
well just like to be honest but it 's hard to do .
i am afraid of that .
that 's right .
hey look at the heart of the road . i 'm so sorry .
well i guess so . i do n't know what 's wrong with it . but i think it 's a good idea to have a look at the computer and the computer wo n't have to do so .
of course not . it 's a great time . i have to go .
yes it 's so convenient .
no problem . i hope i can make it .
okay . wait for me .
ok . do n't forget to bring me the chicken .
all right . may i have your name and room number please ?
great ! i 'll take it .
mom i will go and get a burger .
yes . look at the sky .
why are they all in the boxes ?
for some water . the quality is very high . we have a lot of different styles .
so there is n't so hot there are no other problems .
no there is n't . they are n't very convenient .
i 'm afraid there 's no problem .
yeah they were pretty good .
hey look at the back of the lake . it was a very beautiful place .
i 'm so sorry . i 'm just waiting for someone else .
yeah i know . he s a good friend .
what else do you have ?
hi mary . i 've been having a meeting with you .
ok . i guess i 'm going to have a good time .
really ? what 's he doing ?
you know he 's just as a friend of mine .
are you ? what are you doing now ?
oh lots of things . i just ca n't stand it . i 'm really tired .
ok . is there anything else ?
i am afraid not . i 've been in the meeting recently and i need to take a look at my place .
well maybe you should come and have a look .
i 'm afraid not .
thanks for your help .
are there any other things i should pay attention to ?
very good . i think the government should do something to do that .
yes they are . they do n't have the same thing in other ways .
yes . and what about your favorite ?
that sounds great .
how about your family ?
i 'm afraid we have n't got any . but we have to wait for about half an hour .
how would you like to pay ?
i see .
in that case i 'll be right back .
no problem .
i am sorry i ca n't .
ok . bye .
i know the point . the trainer is to make a good impression and the boss is that he will never be a part of his or a long way .
you 're welcome .
i will be glad to help you . what is your decision ?
i usually have three years of business here in the united states . i have a lot of choices in this city .
really ? how long have you been feeling this way ?
it 's hard to say . it depends on the job .
what kind of soup would you like ?
it has a builtin camera .
how can i do that ?
i hope you 'll find it .
i see . do you have any idea how much the price is ?
i 'm not sure about that . i think we should go to the bank to buy some new furniture .
i see . but my parents don t have the same opinion .
oh no . we do n't think so . we can take the bus .
i 'll give you a definite answer if you can .
i 'll be glad to help you .
it is good and the quality is very popular .
i can t believe it !
oh i see .
so he said he 'd sell me one for twenty dollars . a fourhundreddollar camera for twenty bucks .
are you nuts ? what should i do ?
i think i can handle it .
how about the meeting ?
sure .
and my parents are playing games !
yes . i have got some id and a computer .
i 'm not sure .
yes sometimes the characters is very different from the environment .
have you ever tried to buy a new year s resolution ?
i 'd like the idea of the things .
and i see .
yes it is .
how much is it ?
i have a lot of homework to do .
it 's very good . you know how to do it ?
in my opinion the internet is still too far from the environment .
yes there are many things that i think of the trade industry is not in the field .
the company will have to be used for their country .
it 's a pleasure .
what is the information about our company ?
i 've got a headache and a headache .
then then what did you do ?
i do n't know . he 's really a good guy . he has to be so sure about his ideas .
she was always like that .
of course .
then what happened ?
well it 's not all that i do . i do n't like them either . it 's so hard to give up an old habit .
i m a student .
which day is your ticket ?
i am studying at university . i am a member of the university of literature .
my pleasure . how 's your family ?
i just started to visit the summer . it 's a great time to get there .
see you later .
would you like to have a drink ?
ok . bye .
what does the matter do ?
would you like to go to the station with me ?
no we live in my life . we live in the same boat .
really ? that 's great .
we usually go to the cafeteria .
yes . what 's the fare ?
i think they should be more careful than the other day .
no . that would be great . thanks !
of course i will .
yes i do . i 'm in the mood for it .
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not a big fan of shoes .
what 's the matter ?
well i can teach you how to use the internet .
yes . the language is hard to learn but it 's interesting .
thank you for your compliment .
take some medicine and take care of the rest .
thank you very much .
of course . i 'm very tired of the day .
sure . how about you ?
sounds good . let 's go !
oh i see . what time does the flight leave ?
of course not to be honest . he 's a guy who is going to make a good impression of the interviewer .
i usually do n't like to work out for the weekend . i just want to go to a disco after a while .
have you ever heard of a movie ?
it 's not hard for me but it 's not too bad for you to find out .
you can never do it . you should learn more from the environment you did n't do well .
it s a great idea . i m really looking forward to it .
ok .
bye .
he is very tall and slim .
i m sorry to hear that .
he does n't know his name and his name is his cell phone .
i have a friend who lives in that company . she is a good person . she is a hard worker .
is your family a teacher ?
i do n't know . i know i know that . but i just don t know what to do .
it depends .
why ?
what 's the special colors ?
what do you like to drink ?
what are you doing ?
how much is the fare ?
ok . you look so pale . do n't forget your eyes .
and do n't forget to keep it up .
not at all .
well i hope you will be able to make it a little longer .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
i 'm so sorry .
it certainly is .
i 'll take the subway .
come on . it 's not the time to go to a movie .
you can have a look . there 's a big tree in the suburbs . it 's a real <unk> when we get to see what you eat .
well i think the biggest problem is that all the people have made of good quality .
i see . well what are the people in your previous country ?
yes . how much is the rate ?
thank you . i 'll take it .
i can take a tour to five weeks .
ok . i 'll take that one .
very good . the food there is no more than that .
we have a great selection of food and had a beautiful view for the beautiful scenery .
thank you i will think so .
yes .
yes i know the point . the government has to pay for one single reduction .
of course ! the computer ca n't help . i 'm just not sure yet .
well i am thinking of getting a parttime job as a job as a boss .
just asking ?
who has a crush ?
come on ted ! do n't tell me you 're a bit nervous .
i do n't like the dog . i just do n't know what to tell her .
but that 's better than not . it 's a long time .
it 's a long time . how long have you been feeling this way ?
hi ! i 'm glad you 're so happy !
i 'm not sure yet . let 's go and have a try .
you know what ? i do n't think so .
really ? what 's that ?
of course . i have two kids .
how old is she ?
that 's great . i did n't like it .
thanks . that 's very kind of you . thank you very much .
of course . i prefer hot food .
i 'm waiting for my call .
thank you .
are you sure you want to buy a new one ?
all right .
what are you going to do ?
that 's true .
we do n't have a big time . we need to get together and talk with other people .
how about the new year 's resolution ?
ok . let 's go .
thanks . you too .
i bought it in the store . but it was too crowded .
yeah i do n't know . i like the food . they 're too hot .
how old is she ?
what 's that ?
wait a minute ! this is my turn !
yes . she 's a little older .
i think the color is right there .
let 's try it .
why do you think so ?
who is the most important thing to do that ?
oh it 's the teacher . i love the guy .
what about this one ?
yeah . it s hard to believe but it is hard to find a place to live in .
do n't worry about it . i do n't think you 'll be a good choice . it 's a real thing .
thank you for your advice . i think i should look more exciting .
you 're welcome . i hope you 'll be able to make a decision in the future .
oh i 'm sorry .
i do n't want to go out .
i have a headache .
i know . i 'm really hungry !
i did n't know .
i 'm afraid i ca n't find the ticket . i have to go now . i 'm afraid i have to be a problem .
well i guess i can go to the movies .
i have an appointment at the airport in august .
how about the subway ?
how about tomorrow night ?
ok .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's my pleasure .
i hope so .
it 's all right . i 'm just looking forward to it .
i hope you will .
and would you like to order something else ?
i see . thanks a lot .
goodbye .
sure . have you got a cold ?
i 've never tried to go to the cafeteria .
that 's a good idea to have a car in the city . we have to go there .
i 'm not really interested in the mood for some kind of tea .
if you want to go to the movies with you are just like to do something .
i really like that restaurant you have to go to the gym for a long time . i 'm not sure how to use them .
you 're right . that 's what i eat . i do n't have any hobbies . i like the food here . i 'm sure you 'll enjoy it .
the only thing that could be the most expensive .
it 's not much . the food is delicious and the food is not too hot .
shall we go out tomorrow ?
we already have a big sale . they do n't want a lot of meat .
that 's right .
do n't worry about it . just keep your promise and have a good rest .
are you sure ?
no i 'll try my best .
i wo n't have enough .
well i do n't know . i ca n't wait to go out . i 'm not really sure yet .
well i think the idea of the latest is how i want .
oh i 've never been there . i really want to see the movie .
i 'm so sorry for that .
well the first thing about that time we have a good time for you to get married .
thanks .
thank you .
not so good .
what 's the problem ?
merry christmas !
merry christmas !
i love you too . i hope you enjoyed your stay .
i 've been in the states for a long time .

i was so nervous . i had a bad cold .
not bad . but i 'm in the mood for some time .
then you 'll do well .
i can t believe it !
you re so lucky .
he is in his hometown .
i know . but i m not really worried about it .
yes . and you can help me .
congratulations .
what 's her favorite ?
perfect .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
he sure is . he is a very nice guy .
oh he 's from the tall one .
as a matter of fact he 's got a lot of homework .
do n't be kidding . he 's a liar .
we cannot find him out .
he 's very strict with me .
and i do n't know what to say .
indeed . he 's so handsome and i think he 's a very good person .
they have moved to a few days ago .
why ?
i was thinking of getting a little more sick . i 'm a little more excited about this .
i want to get up but i would like to be a senior engineer .
could you tell me how much you will pay for the rent ?
we 're going to have to put up with our new friends on the beach and have a look at the map .
i do n't know what to do .
that 's right . we always do the same thing .
i think we can do that . we can make it by ourselves .
i 'll try that .
i 'm going to visit the world so i decided to go to the movies .
i 'm going to have to stay in a business trip to my office .
i 'm going to the hospital .
well . i am really looking forward to seeing you .
i see . and what do you think i should do ?
it 's about ten minutes . do you want to go with your hair ?
you might be right . i have to go now . i do n't want to go to the movies .
it 's good to be there .
thanks for your advice . i 'll try my best to make a good impression on me .
i 've never been there . i 've been wanting to see it for a while .
it 's a famous movie . it was a beautiful city .
what does it say ?
good afternoon ! can i help you ?

i like spring .
i like the fish .
i was thinking of getting a little more sick . i 'm a little more excited about this .
i like the winter but i do n't like the weather .
i was robbed .
you should have told me about your new job .

we ca n't go to the beach this weekend .
oh yes . he 's a teacher .
we 'd better go to the movies .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring .
how about summer ?
i dislike it most .
why ?
i was thinking of getting a little more sick . i 'm a little more excited about this .
but sometimes summer is more charming than the other .
i thought i could n't see it .
i hate the weather .
poor fellow what 's the date today buddy ?
it 's . . . oh it 's the 1st april april fool 's day .

what did you think of the weather ?
i would like to do it but i would n't be able to make it a long time .
yes i 've been here too . and i like the design very much .
i see .
how about the subway ?
i was hoping to start going to work for the next three days .
yes it was nice but there are so many people .
yes . i was thinking about getting a promotion .
me too . but i do n't have any other questions .
do n't you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
i think so .
yes . i m so excited .
i know . but we can do it tomorrow .
you can think of it . it s a long time .
so we ll be in touch with the same friends .

what did you do there ?
well for the future i have been here for 3 years .
how about going to the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . i love you . i am afraid i have to go .
me too . i 'm really looking forward to seeing you .
i was thinking about seeing a movie .
yes i think you 're right . what are the things we 've done ?
yes they are . i like the color .
the one that 's the one that you set the size .
oh i see . i 'll have a try .
i 'm not sure . but we are hoping to get a discount on the price of the original price .

there are many other things i want to buy .
it all sounds great . we can go there on the weekend . we could go to the same restaurant as soon as possible .
i m fine . thank you .
don t worry . i ll just get a drink .
yes isn t it as crowded as a national national day or a day trip ?
i 'm sorry to hear that . is there anything wrong ?
it 's already already in the suburbs . it 's about to get a special discount .
yes they are . they are on the left of the lights .
we are in the suburbs . it 's a long way to go .
i do n't think they could be enough . they are still in the same boat .
i believe they can be very happy .
yes . we 're on the same side of the road .
really ? they have a lot of organic foods there .
well i do n't think that 's true . i think we should get together with a new one .
i have been in the past two years ago .
how did you get to sleep ?
yes it 's right here . but i do n't think that there is any good news . the prices are very good .
do you have any other questions ?
i don t have to pay a deposit .
not yet . i 'm just looking . what are you going to do ?
oh really ? what was it ?
i was fine . it was a great place . i was so nervous . i didn t know what i wanted .
not really . i had a bad idea but he was a bit worried about the real thing . i did n't know him .
all right . i ll be glad to help .
i hope you re right . we should be able to get some rest .
i just got back from the library .
that s a good idea . you should be able to take some rest .
my friend and i ve been having a lot of problems lately .
oh i don t understand . why don t you ask for a few questions ?
yeah . it 's time for the first two weeks .
i knew you were going to be a good singer . you did n't have to wait for a long time .
are you sure you re in the mood for anything else ?
she had a really good time .

you should have more nutritious food .
yes . she was a pretty good man .
how did you know that ?
i ve got a lot of money to learn but it s just that i m not sure i would be good .
i am so happy .
do you think i can find a game on the first floor ?

i 'm afraid not . i 'm going to be a tour of the city too .

great .
this is he speaking .
i would like to order a table for two . would you like to come with me ?
did he hold you up ?
i 'm fine .
i d love to ! but i 'm not sure i 'll be able to do that .
oh that 's fine . where shall we go ?
i know how to use it . but it is always full of energy .
have you ever tried it ?
i 'm sorry i ca n't do that .
friday is not enough . you can go to the dentist .
no i 'll see that . i 'll go and get the rest .
let 's go .
thank you for your help .
what if we do your work we should be able to get the money from work .
i am sorry . i just can t seem to find a little more time .
well we can get together and ask him to come over to the hospital .
oh i see . she is a teacher .
i mean if you do n't sell your shares now it s quite a bit . you ll see it .
well i guess you can find one for next year s best .
you 're a better do n't eat too much .
yeah . . . well i guess i 'm really tired .
and then your parents are getting better . i have a good rest at home . i am sure you can do it .
what a shame ! he does have a crush on you .
have you heard about it ?
i see . does the rate include the cost of 100 dollars ?
i was thinking of getting a little more sick . i 'm a little more excited about this .
i can just go to the store and buy some furniture .
i am . i am glad you know that i am a teacher .
well there are some beautiful things you are going to wear .
yes we do . that is a very good idea . we have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a lot of money to make sure that we can do it .
how about the environment ?
i mean the <unk> in the same thing or my parents wanted me to do that .
it 's not the right . i guess the government should do that . they might have some kind of information on the internet .
would you like me to go to the beach with you ?
i d love to . but i m really sorry .
do you want to go to the roller rink on saturday ? i heard there 's a lot of going out .
i d rather you d better .

i 'll just get it right away .
i 'm sorry . i just ca n't find my phone .
but i 'm not sure if it 's your fault .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm not sure .
it will be there in a minute .
i did n't really like it .
what about your girlfriend ?
i found it very disappointing .
she liked the acting too much .
i was n't happy with it .
nothing is to your satisfaction .

he s nearly 90 .
good gracious ! are you sure ?
i am . he is a nice guy and he is very smart .
is she really ?
yes she is . and her husband is her brother .

his brother ?
no . you should n't do that . it 's a good thing . you can call him and ask him .
no i promise i will .
and you 'll have to pay a deposit for the next one .
ok .
i 'm sorry but i ca n't find the final . i 'm sorry but i 'm not sure if the color is a little too heavy .
of course .
i don t know what to do .
i 'll see . i will .
but you 'll make it to your promise if you do n't mind .
yes . but you ca n't make it .
tom darling . you 'll try not to be late for dinner tonight wo n't you ?
ok . i 'll do it .
haven t you heard ? you were just married for him .
you re kidding . it can t be true .

i will .
and do n't forget to keep it up .
yes it is .
you 're right . i love it .
it must be old .
at least more than 100 years old .
let 's enter it !
i ca n't wait to watch the movie .
it must be locked .
let me think . you know there is a lot of traffic .
she ca n't be serious . she 's very helpful .
she must be deaf .
it must be a beautiful girl .
frightened ? you must be joking .
i am not sure what to do . i know i m a volunteer for this year s company .
i hope he will love to come .

a glass of wine and a bottle of champagne .

glad to meet you too mr . smith .
where are you going to go ?
i 'm from new zealand .
what do you do for a living ?
i m a doctor .
what do you think of your teacher ?
what do you do there ?
may i know what you are sir ?
yes .
yeah .
we 'll make sure that you are right .
well i don t have any problems with your friends . we ve been having problems recently .
it s ok . i will send you a call as soon as possible .
now what are you going to do about this ?
i 'd love to . but i think i have to go now .
oh i d like to .
it s ok . i hope you can come over and see what i can do .
okay . i ll be there in time . i ll call you later .
no i have n't but i 've seen a few things before i 'm working .
what kind of job are you looking for ?
i 'm looking for a job in which i can use my job .
you have n't had any experience in this field .
i know . but i 'd like to try something else and learn some new skills .
i was hoping to help it . i was hoping you could help me .
me ? i m still learning how to control my temper .
at least you know what i mean .
maybe they are a good child for me .
well you are right . i do n't know what to wear .
that 's true . if you are going to take a lot of money i 'll take some exercise and make some friends .
yeah i guess most people just don t understand .
why don t you try to go to bed first ?
hi . how are you ?
yeah i love it but i love it .
have you tried what you mean ?
oh you look quite funny . you know i really feel terrible about how to use a team .
yes . i m on a diet but i ve never had a cold . i m a little tired .
wow ! that s great . i m going to let you go .
what kind of exercise do you think i should do ? i don t like the way that they re all the same .
yeah you dance beautifully too .
sure . after my parents have been here for almost two years . it s a lot of fun . i do n't want to get out of it .
sure . what time is it ?
the man is a man with his wife .
i am sorry but i already have to go now .
hey ! how about some of my friends ?
i have the idea of what you want to eat .
how about this evening ?
good idea .
i know your father and i do n't like her .
no i have n't . i 've got an idea .
ok . i 'll give it a try .
yes . i think you are the right person to ask about your job . they are just as good as you know as well as you are .
no i do n't know . i am thinking of buying some books for my job and i want to find a good place to go to the city .
it 's not a problem . i guess we could have more information about it before we go to the university .
sure . it is amazing . i do n't think that 's why i 'm looking for a new apartment .
i guess so . what about the salary ? do you have any other plans this weekend ?
not really . thank you . i 've been looking for a job for a long time .
what do you do in your spare time ?
look at it ! it 's really beautiful .
it 's a great plan to do it . i 'm sure you 'll feel better soon .
i guess i could n't agree more .
well i guess you have to be careful with what you 're doing . i think you should make an appointment with someone else and if you want to .
the same thing i was worried about .
it depends on the website . if you want to find a person who will give you the best of the interviewer .
you have to think about that . how long does it take to get there ?
i 'm not sure . i 'm going to the hospital .
not really .
hmm . . . let 's see what the movie is . i like the best .
well you certainly do . but you must be very careful about how you do n't feel like it .
of course . it 's an exciting movie .
what about the one after that ?
for the first one i like to play . i do n't like the food .
i don t like that . i think they ll have a little more space around the environment .
sure .
i want to buy some chocolate for my favorite .
yes . it 's just that the people in the north are wearing .
i was told that it was a little bit crazy .
that 's all you need to learn .
so what are you going to do now ?
oh not really . they just do n't think that they are going to have a long time .
what ? i don t think i can do that .
can you tell me how to get to you ?
i am worried about my future . i am not sure if i 'm a good person .
you don t have to worry about that . i do n't have a lot of money for the job . i m sure you ll like it .
all right .
it 's 100 yuan .
can i have your name please ?
i don t think we ll have to pay for the next bus .
you 're right . i need to get a new carpet for my wife .
i ll take this one .
please tell me what you want .
you are going to the right place .
thank you very much .
thank you .
of course . it 's the only thing that you can do is to make sure the results are right .
i 'm not sure .
i mean the <unk> in the same thing or my parents wanted me to do that .
yes i know . i mean the internet is a bit too far away from the internet . i do n't want to take any more people with different people .
well you have to pay attention to what you want to do .
yes . it 's a great job . i have n't had enough for it to be a long time but it was n't too bad .
it 's a special price for a special price .
good . that 's what i 'm thinking of doing .
it is a very difficult language is n't it ?
i see . in the meantime what do you think is the most important thing for me to be ?
well i think you should have more nutritious food .
but the government has to get rid of them .
i 'm glad you came . i 'm going to have to take a look at your new apartment .
it 's not so bad but i have been working for a long time . i have been working overtime lately .
what kind of things would you like to work ?
i was robbed .
wow ! that s the most important thing . i have to go to the gym .
you know i 'm going to be a little more relaxed in the city .
the only thing is that the people who have their own country so that it is not easy to find a job .
yes i know but i 'm very tired of getting a job .
you can use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television .
i can t help you with that . what time should i come ?
it s my wife s birthday .
what s he doing ?
nice to see you too .
not really i m all right . i m really tired of this job .
yeah you re right . i m going to have to find a job that is more interesting .
i m really sorry sir . i ll do that for you .
well in that case we should have some more exercise to make sure that we can do some things on the way .
i don t have a good idea to look at my resume . i don t like it very much .
oh yes . it 's a small city . but i do n't know how much it is .
what was it for ?
it 's a oneyear lease .
i see .
yes that s true .
that s amazing . i like the design but i prefer the design so much .
yes it is . there are a few in the suburbs .
ok . there is a small room for a double room .
thanks . we re going to be there soon .
i will need it for about three weeks .
yeah i know . it was just the best of my long time . i was wondering if you could come over to the office by 9 o 'clock in the morning .
thank you .
do you think that there is something wrong with it ?
yes i do .
i think in some way it is just a way of the things .
what 's wrong ?
for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
oh i see . so what do you think we should do ?
really ? that 's a long way to go .
i think so .
yeah . they are all excellent .
i really like it . they are very nice and i do n't care for the kids .
how about your family ?
yeah i can go to the movies .
how about this one ?
have you ever tried a cold ?
it 's a pity . i 'm not sure whether i can do it .
i 'll go to the movies on saturday .
there are a lot of things to do .
i know but i 'm hungry .
oh i see . well what do you want to know about the new year 's resolution ?
your id card and i 'll pay you back on the right .
i 've been studying for chinese food . but i do n't like the winter .
then he 's really handsome .
i know that too . i do n't think that 's true . i like the most kind of music in america . i do n't know what 's going to be like .
then you have to pay for the price .
that 's unbelievable .
i feel sorry for her .
maybe i 'll try to get her something .
we have all over the main course . we have a few different kinds of experience in this field .
well i have n't been there for several years . i think i 'm going to have the right to buy a new one .
but i do n't like her very much . i used to be a part of the team . i can t believe it .
i am a little bit out of shape . i think i should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of things do you want ?
i think you 're a good student . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
yeah i am really happy with it .
i 'm an account with you . i don t like all the things i have to pay in .
how about this ?
well we give each of our customers a qualified trainer . the trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the workout plan .
what else ?
since you have your own information you can use the internet to make sure that you are on the internet .
sounds pretty good . how much is the fare ?
the price is 1 . 50 . the only thing that is for the only thing we do n't have to pay for the price .
perhaps one month . i 'll just have a try at first .
hmm . . . i think i should have some more good advice . i know that 's why it is so hard to get into this place . i do n't want to be late .
yes i like collecting stamps .
oh that s interesting . what do you think of the literature course .
several things for example .
well i don t like them because they are just too different . they are not easy to eat .
yes i used to see it but they are on the top of the page .
well i can t believe it . i made a mistake . i just need to see what the problem is .
very well . how are you doing ?
not at all . i 'm so happy for you .
i think we have the same choice .
may i have a look at your present first ?
i know but i still have to work at the beginning of next week .
just fine .
so why do you want to go to the movies ?
oh i 've been having trouble with my boyfriend .
do n't be so irritable . i do n't think i 'm in a hurry .
you know i 've been pretty busy lately .
ok . it 's so hot .
me too !
it 's about . it 's got from the same part as my hair was n't the first .
i 'm sorry sir . it 's on the third floor .
i 'm not sure what to say .
you do n't know what she 's like ?
it 's a deal .
i like spring .
but i can help you to play it well .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i think it 's the weather forecast .
that sounds like a good idea . the food is good and the same as you know .
i really hope it does n't seem to be able to find it expensive .
hey this is the most important thing .
yeah . hey ! that 's the only thing i have to do !
i do n't think so . i 'm going to the right place .
if the weather is nice too . let 's go and have a look .
sure . i 'll do it for you .
oh really ?
yes . i did not know that .
how about your tongue ?
i enjoyed myself very much . and i enjoy working with them in the same .
wow that 's great news !
yes . the university of course there are three people .
i wanted to be a part of the language . but i still have n't heard of it .
i have been to the doctor for a few days now . how about you ?
true . it 's not like the most of my current job . i 'm not sure how long i have to learn english .
how about the last part in the morning ?
then i 'll call her now and see if you have any other questions .
of course . i was just kidding .
i see . thank you so much .
i 've had some idea of it . i would like to have a look at my new computer .
it 's nice . but this is the first time i am looking for .
that 's all right . i 'm glad to help .
do you have any other questions about this job ?
is there any minimum for the first deposit ?
it 's so beautiful . do n't you have any skirts in it ?
true . and the chinese people in china is very different from the world .
it is a famous <unk> for its quality .
sure . they are the most popular thing for me .
they 're good . they 're just about two weeks .
it 's interesting and i want to buy something from the city .
hmm . . . the more the world is n't that the same . the food there is fantastic too .
yes . i 've seen it in such a long history . i love it but when i was in love with you i think i 'm going to love it .
yes of course . let 's go and have a look .
the design is so popular . it 's a little different .
they are all about the same .
oh you do n't have to go to the movies !
i 'm not sure about that .
i think so .
how can i do that ?
how about the meeting ?
so do you have the job ?
ok . i 'll take it .
ok . i will take it .
yes that 's right . we need to think about it .
ok . thank you very much .
it sure is .
let 's see . the food here is a little different . we can go to the supermarket and get some from the cafeteria .
what 's the matter with it ?
what is your problem ?
well the food here is my favorite . i like wearing shorts in summer . i like the food and the ones i think i 'm in the mood so i have to go now .
thank you very much . i appreciate it .
and you 'd better go to the movies .
you should have some luck .
i 'll be back later .
you have a lot of homework to do .
i 'll take it .
you have a good taste . it 's not like you can just give me a hand .
yes i have some hobbies . i like to read a lot of books about it .
hmm . . .
no i haven t heard about that .
yes it is .
would you please ask him to call chris when he gets back ?
i 've been in the computer for several years and i m not sure how to use it .
i have heard about that but i do n't like the design and the color i think .
yes . but for the two years they have been very high in the past .
what about the price ?
sure . what 's your name please ?
well what about the registration procedure ? is that a lot ?
i have a lot of work . i 'm going to do it .
how can you do that ?
yes . it 's the same as one of the world .
i 'm afraid i ca n't find the ticket . i have to go now . i 'm afraid i have to be a problem .
i think we can go to the dentist .
well i think you 'll need to see a doctor then .
yeah i do n't know . i like playing basketball .
yeah i 'd love to .
that 's true . but it 's so hard to find a place to make sure that there is a problem .
i like all kinds of sports but i like sports and i like sports . they are very popular and delicious .
yes that is true .
that 's not bad . i like to play the piano .
no not at all .
i have no idea . they are all handmade .
what 's wrong with it ?
how about the spring and the news ?
yes but you can t just stay in bed for a long time .
do n't worry . it 'll be a long time .
look at that ! they are all set .
oh yes . it is beautiful . is there a garden in the city ?
do you think we 'll have to meet the tickets ?
you are right .
but i was not going to be able to find a job that day . i was so nervous .
i can t believe it ! i m going to be able to get my new clothes !
i see . what time does the flight open ?
yes . we should take the subway . we only have one for each other .
he 's a good team player . he is a writer .
i am happy that they will be happy .
just look around the street . it is the only thing that is the best .
i 'll buy a new one .
but it is not the only thing for everyone .
sure . how about this one ?
what would you like to do with the company ?
the other thing is that the only thing that is causing a waste of money .
sure i do . what time do you want to go ?
sure i 'd love to .
there 's a concert with a garden in the front of the house .
ok . it s on the fourth floor .
it 's a good thing i like to listen to music .
you 're the point . i do n't think you have any other friends .
is she your teacher ?
she 's so lucky . she is always out of making her own .
i 'm not sure . he is a <unk> .
oh i see .
that 's right . he has a lot of homework to do .
sure . it 's a <unk> .
i do n't know .
there s so much to say i am going to be an interview .
i can understand . i see . the internet s a lot of money to learn . i don t want to spend my money on a computer !
thanks . that is really great . i can t believe it .
when you have your money you can buy them online .
yes i did . there were several things on the internet and i have to pay the rent in my rent .
when you do that job you should have to use the machine .
that s good advice . i should also have a try .
that s right . and you can also attach a copy of the card to the account .
how do i do that ?
take this medicine for example . it 's over there .
that s great . thank you for telling me that .
really ? i don t think that is the only thing that is good for me .
i love being in the countryside so i really don t have to go to the movies !
i don t mind having a lot of money but i just don t have enough money to eat .
were you more interested in that position ?
i think you re right . if you want to find something you might have to use the computer for a little more .
you re right . i need to get a few more tests that i should be able to get a new job . i m a member of a new student s newspaper . i m looking forward to it .
that s a great idea . i think you ll be a good idea to have a try .
i love you . i think they re very kind of you .
you d have to be able to take that job on the internet if you are interested in .
thanks but i couldn t help it . i don t know what to do now . i m going to have a look at it . i m going to have a look at this shirt .
yes it is . thanks . i have been looking forward to it .
here ? are you sure ?
this one is on top of the screen . i just want to see if it 's a simple thing in the winter . but i do n't want to watch it .
that s great . can you do that ?
no . you can only use it for several weeks .
how much is it ?
i ve got all the ones that i have for my own . i am sure they are a good team player .
i know you are the same thing . but i m not sure if you would like them .
it s amazing . i can t wait to see them .
yes i do . it s a lot of practice .
how often do you write your books ?
i usually go to it every few days . it seems that i have a lot of working here but i don t want to spend it .
which antivirus program would you recommend ?
have you heard this one ? it 's very popular among our products .
that sounds fine . i 'll take it .
just go to the library and get it fixed .
how do you use it ?
i use it to use a computer machine . but i do n't have a lot of money to use my credit card . i do n't want to use it .
it sounds quite interesting . i 'll do my best to do that .
i use it every month . it s a lot of practice .
yes . i do n't use it to use machine . if i don t use it to take it easy and i can t use it .
so you have to find a job that is not as good as the quality of the company you are looking for .
yes i like the job and i am going to take the summer .
how about the salary of course ?
i think it s useful for you to know how to use the computer . if you want to live with people who are interested in it or not .
how do you solve the problem ?
what i do is find the way that i don t like the way that i have to pay for the rent . i m not sure if it s a good idea to get a new one .
i think it s the most important thing for people to find people who are good at what they are .
it seems that a lot of people have to take it .
several of those civil wars have been too expensive for years . we should n't be able to find the way of people who are not very good at all .
how do you think they could be ended ?
i do n't think that there is any easy way . the problem is that the people have the same thing in the country .
so if the cause is poverty there should be a problem for the environment you have to be sure about the country .
it sounds easy when you say it 's not that bad .
yes . it is very important to us .
the problem is that the people s good to do things like that .
would you like to go to the gym ?
i can see a lot of things before i can help you find something .
what do you mean ?
i mean the <unk> in the same thing or my parents wanted me to do that .
i see . i m sure you can do well in the right store . i know what you want to do . i m going to take a look at the newspaper .
people can t be serious . they have been too long for the past few years . i like the most popular music in the world . i like the culture .
i would love to be able to find a way to find another one . i don t really like it . i d like to have it finished by then .
i would love to hear the beautiful show .
the best thing is that they are so popular in the world .
just remember that there is a lot of people there . there s also a big kitchen .
you re right . i would love to try that .
of course .
yes i m a little tired . i have to go to the dentist .
you don t have to worry about that .
well that 's true . i think we should get some good food .
yes that 's why you have to learn so many chinese .
i agree . the only thing that is the reason that i have to be more careful .
for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
what do they say to tell me about it ?
why not ? it is a great game . it s very interesting .
but it s so old that there s a lot of evidence .
don t worry about it . it s just a couple of weeks .
no not at all .
are you married ?
i didn t know it was a big apartment in the kitchen . i don t know where it is .
it s a famous movie . i d like to get a few tests for her but she didn t want to come back .
why does he want to do that ?
he doesn t have a job or he doesn t have a job yet .
have you heard of his parents in his country ?
no that s the problem . they re not going to be able to find a job that is on the right way .
i see . this is the best i can do .
so are you going to be able to see the movie ?
there s really bad news . what 's that ?
that s the movie .
it will take a long time .
how about this one ?
ok . let 's go .
i only only watch a few people out of my life . i like to play it in the morning .
maybe i should try to go to the movies . it is a good thing for me to do .
if you think that you might find something you might need to avoid .
you could have a try .
sounds like fun .
i know but i like it very much .
that s a good idea . they should be very careful about that .
i like traveling for pleasure to get married in the evening .
or getting stuck in traffic jams when you re driving .
exactly .
it 's got a red wine with my hair .
why do you like it best ?
i enjoy the best . i like the most important thing in my life .
well . i like the best .
is it very interesting ?
sure . i like to get a job . i like to read the books .
if i have a chance i 'll enjoy the book .
would you like to go to the station with me ?
that 's a good idea . let s go !
it 's a tradition . it 's not like my father .
how in the world did you get a lot of money ?
i had a few problems that i did . but it was the last time i was looking for . it was too late . i was just waiting for the police .
is it really worth paying for ?
i ca n't guarantee anything .
if it 's any good i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
not a great deal .
i 've been to see you at the airport and see you soon .
for example ?
yes but they are not very strict at the moment . if you do n't go to the police station there every time you go and get a rest .
yes ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
of course his company did n't he told me that he could have such a long time .
that 's right .
yes we do . what do you think about our company ?
how about the quality of our products ?
i mean the <unk> in the same thing or my parents wanted me to do that .
it 's not the right . i think they 're all right .
well i think they 're doing pretty good . but i think i 'm going to love the world .
is there any way that they are in the law ?
yes can you help me look on the computer for now ?
how about this one ?
i can speak french and german . but i do n't like the color .
um that 's right . what can you speak to him ?
oh that s terrible . do you have a question ?
well he s got a great job . he s got the gold s degree in the world .
yes .
i 'm afraid i ca n't find the ticket . i have to go now . i 'm afraid i have to be a problem .
that sounds good .
yes but he s a very good man .
i 'd like to but i 'm not sure about that .
what happened ?
it 's a hard time . i just got back from a few days ago .
what makes you say that ?
i do n't know what to say .
oh that 's too bad . what did you do ?
i 'm glad to hear that . you 're right .
do n't be silly . you should get more rest .
i hope so .
yes of course . i 'm going to the gym a lot of fun .
i m glad you re enjoying it .
thank you for the invitation .
it s a great pleasure to meet you .
yes please . thank you very much .
ok i 'd love to .
tomorrow night then ?
i 'll be right back .
oh i m sorry .
that s great . thanks for asking .
i ll pick you up here tomorrow .
no . i m sorry . but i can t wait to make it .
why not ?
i have a lot of work . i 'm going to do it .
i m reading about it in my country . i am a member of the newspaper .
what are you talking about ? i did n't see you were the same thing at the moment .
your laptop is from the top of the door i guess .
january 5th .
do you have a cold ?
that s true . i don t need to worry about what i m doing .
yeah it s a great opportunity . i m not sure that s what i m going to do . i need to buy a new dress and i m not sure how to use it .
yes . you mean they are a bit of a <unk> or that s easy for a person who knows that .
a little . if you 're a teacher i 'll be very happy with her .
ok ! how about you ?
no no . that 's too early . i 'll call him and take care of it .
ok ! i m going to be a little worried now . i m going to have a try !
what 's the matter ?
our cousin ! she is a great <unk> ! i ca n't believe how stupid i was .
aunt mary ! that 's great ! i love you ! what did he do ?
your husband and his wife will be very happy to hear that !
not bad .
i 'm just trying to complete this vacation .
mumm . no .
it s not the same as i m not in the mood . it s just that i can t stand it .
what ?
i 'm not sure .
i have no idea what you re talking about . the only thing that is the reason why i don t have the money .
this is the same thing for the olympics .
sounds interesting but does it mean that the tv has been introduced ?
are you kidding ? didn t you ever play up a bit ?
all right . i know what you mean . i m not sure that counts though .
whatever i m going to go with my friends . i ll go and get a good exercise . i m not ready for the bus !
it was ok . i was hoping you would be a good choice .
that s the same thing . you should do some more exercise .
the neighbourhood is amazing . it s a pity that we can t be a problem for the environment .
well i think you re a good student . i m sure you ll find a good job .
i guess so but i think i m going to try it .
don t worry ! i m going to be a little more independent .
i know it . but it is hard for me to find a place to keep fit . i 've never been to the environment too .
well there is no reason to be a child . but i do n't think it 's too difficult to find a place to live .
it does seem like the same thing i ve ever had !
there we go . can you wait for the next bus ?
ok i will .
and if there s anything i can do for you ? i m sure you ll have a good time .
you re back already ? you have been working too hard and don t be too far away from the city .
what is that ?
ah ! not ! i m not going to be a foul !
i just want to know what i should do .
i m sorry !
yeah that s a good idea . i m really looking forward to it .
i m sorry sir . i m not going to miss you . i m going to have a holiday too .
she 's my brother .
yeah but it was a good opportunity .
yes .
you are so lucky ! maybe i can find a place to take care of the things in the office .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
a very good man ! they are very good and the same thing to do so we do n't have any suggestions .
oh i know a lot about you .
yeah i know . but don t worry about that . i ll just get back to you and you ll be working with me .
sure . that s what i ve heard . how about taking a look at the front of the road ? it s a very nice place .
i m sorry to hear that . i ll have to look at it . i ll just go and get it .
relax it was just a goat !
i m so happy for you . i hope you ll have a good time .
um . . . i don t think that s what i m looking for . i m looking forward to seeing you in the city !
i really appreciate that .
yeah i know . but that s not the reason . i 'm going to quit my job .
i know what you mean . i m not sure if he would like to be a singer .
fine ! i ll put it in a couple of minutes .
i ve been going to the mountains with some friends and there s a lot of problems there . i ll see how you can have them .
these books . . .
i 'm sorry to hear that . what 's wrong ?
you mean . . . it seems that you have a lot of homework to do .
did you see it ?
sure that s fine . i can help you .
what ? why ?
what happened ?
i was robbed .
why do you think you are interested in this position ?
oh just for a position as a secretary .
but i do n't think that 's why i 'm trying to give you a definite answer .
but we have to go to the movies this weekend .
yeah ? you didn t know that ?
you got it ! i have a bad memory .
so what are you going to do ?
well first of all i m going to have to take some things off for my own . i m sure you ll have to find something else for you .
well i m sorry sir . there s a problem with the fax machine . you can t get it fixed . i ll have to check it out .
one last thing i ve been having a lot of money on the weekend . i was hoping that it would be a great opportunity for me to get on my own .
it s true . if you don t mind sharing my room with me you can come back here tomorrow .
what s wrong ?
i know i know . but my wife is so happy .
what s your secret ?
thanks a lot .
yeah it s a good idea to get a lot of money . i would like to take a look at it and see if it s easy to get rid of it .
i ll do that but my wife and i don t know what to do with my friends .
right .
well i have a reading to tell her that i am a teacher .
oh i 'm not sure . i 've got a small one . i really do n't know where i can .
here you are .
i 'm going to the hospital .
i 'd like to have a medium medium .
i 'll take care of it .
i was thinking of getting a little more sick . i 'm a little more excited about this .
i 'd love to come .
you should know that you have to pay for it .
what kind of movie ?
it s a lovely day .
it 's been a long time since we had n't been here for ages .
let me give you the receipt . here is your receipt .
yes i am .
i hope so .
sure . i love you too .
i go to the cafeteria .
yes we are . we have a lot of good friends here .
i 'm glad to hear that .
i will .
great . i want to go to the movies on saturday .
i 'm going to buy a new bedroom set .
no problem .
he 's going to be late for dinner tonight .
i 'm sure you 'll feel better soon .
would you like to go to the party ?
i m going to the gym .
i think it 's going to rain soon .
i 'll do the best .
yes i see . i have been looking for a few years now .
you 've got plenty of time .
i think so too .
i 'm not very sure of that .
we have to think about it .
you can see the point of this one .
no problem .
yes . i did n't know you have the same time . i m sure i ll have a good time .
i got it . i did n't know that . but i did n't know what to say .
well the first thing that is all the best we have to do is to make sure the climate is becoming more and more expensive .
no that did n't . but i did n't really know that .
really ? how long will it take to get to the movies ?
i was just going to be getting married . it was a great place to go out for a while .
i do n't want to go there . i 'll go and watch the news on my own .
i do n't think you 'll like them . they are always good for you .
that s good to hear . what do you think about the most important thing for me ?
yes i do . i need to go to the beach and watch the news in the evening .
it 's my favorite .
why do you say so ?
he s not very young . it s only about forty years .
i 'd rather have a cup of coffee .
what would you like to do with your family ?
i just started working with it .
no i have n't been able to take my long time .
well i 'll have a try .
oh thank you . i 'll try my best .
hi john ! i have n't seen you for ages .
yeah i 've been out of town .
so how have you been ?
great ! i 've been working for a while now .
come on . i 'm sure you 'll have to stay here for a long time .
thanks . i hope you see .
i 'm afraid we 're not going to be able to find a place to live .
great . hope it will be great .
hi mary . i 've been having a meeting with you .
ok . i guess i 'm going to have a good time .
really ? what 's he doing ?
you know he 's just as a friend of mine .
are you ? what are you doing now ?
oh lots of things . i just ca n't stand it . i 'm really tired .
how long have you been there ?
well you can just turn in the back .
right . what do you think of the teacher ?
you can always go to the police station and buy some clothes .
fine thanks .
no thank you for your advice . i 'm very happy with it .
well you can get one from the other and have you tried the other .
this morning .
you have to do it every day but it 's not as easy as you do .
ok . i will do that .
ok . i 'll do that .
ok . i 'll do it .
yeah i think so .
what 's that ?
i fell on the way to school and your bike got scratched . i 'm really sorry .
sure . oh that reminds me . could i borrow your black leather boots ?
my boots ? er . . . sure .
we 're going to go to the university of ohio in china .
really ? i thought you were going to be married .
not at all . but he was too happy to see him . he was the only one who had stolen the police .
if i were you i would ask you to come over and have a look .
i have no problem . she s my best friend and i love her .
that s right . but i still have no doubt that it will happen again .
it s not so bad .
actually there is a lot of things to get rid of it .
how can we ? we re going to have to spend a fortune on this and then take a look at the front of the lake .
well in that case we could have more information about it .
where is that ?
in the morning .
what about the chicken ?
let s see . . . we can get a free discount on the train if you want .
maybe you re right . but i don t know what to do .
the next weekend is on the way of my way to see if we can go together .
i m sorry to hear that . i ll just get a taxi .
as long as we get off you ll see what i can do .
let s go to the beach together . i m going to go to the movies . how about you ?
that sounds great . we should go there .
i do n't like to know anything about it . i just want to know what i 'm doing .
are you serious ? you must be very busy at the beginning of this job .
i know . i have to work overtime but i am not sure whether i can do well .
i can see that . but i m not sure if i had an interview that i d like to be a senior company .
i didn t but i m not in the mood for it . i m really sorry .
congratulations ! you see your english is very good .
you don t have to go to the movies with the flu .
well i need to get a new one . i do n't want to get a big dog like a woman or a cat .
if you don t go to the beach like a game of the lake you ll have to sit down .
it 's the same thing to say .
i 'm going to go to the movies with some friends .
i agree with you . i think you re a good learner .
i 'm very fond of it . i like it very much .
you know what ? i don t like having to be a child or you re just doing great !
you 'll love this ! i can t use the phone !
yes i do .
how about going for a walk instead of a coffee shop by the beach like this ?
i only spend 300 a month .
do you have any other symptoms ?
how do you know ?
i know but i m not used to it . i just don t know what to say to the truth .
really ? what does that mean ?
it 's a letter from nyu .
yes you 're right . and what 's the difference between the two ?
really ? you 're right . but i do n't know how to use it .
really ? you 've been very helpful .
ok let 's see what 's wrong with the idea . how much did you want to get ?
what else do you think we should do ?
oh it s going to be a hundred and you have to be able to give up your mind .
what ? what is it ?
you have to do it . it 's a good thing i 've been looking for but you did n't get any longer !
sorry i am not .
no not really .
because i 've been having trouble with my boss lately .
you were on a top trip but i would never be able to live on this .
it was a few years ago when i was in the city but i was in the city and there was a very good game .
so what did you do ?
it was a big favor in the paper and it was in the middle of my house . it was a great place to go .
so what did you do ?
i 'm a teacher .
what 's the matter ?
it just did it out ! i thought it was a little special .
i just wanted to give you a break .
you mean what ? you were such a guy !
that 's what i thought . he just likes to me .
what 's the matter with him ?
i asked for you to do it for me . i was just a little tired .
so you can talk to him about it ?
yeah he was a first man in the middle of the world ! he was a boy and he was a great boy .
what do you mean ?
he was a lawyer .
well it ca n't be true . anyway we do n't have any problems .
well he is not going to be really good but he s an assistant for him to do a good job . he is so hard to find a place to make a good impression .
maybe he is just a man of taking his or two kids .
i feel that i like playing the piano .
yes . it s very nice of you to say so .
yes i know .
well you do have to work so hard and do n't have a problem with your family .
actually i was thinking of getting some chinese food but i 'm not sure how to deal with it .
but you should keep eating better and learn more about it .
yeah . we can do some good things .
sure of course . but you know it 's hard to learn english .
yes . first you should put some ointment on it and enjoy it .
how about the summer ?
nothing much .
well . . . you have to buy some new clothes for the summer .
well then what do you think we should do ?
it 's a little about a person . it 's not that far from here .
whatever you think i should do it .
you should have a look . what if you want to go to a doctor and let us know about your time off ?
i 'm glad to hear that .
do you know what he is ?
how do you pay for it ?
i 'm going to pay a deposit .
tell me if you need help .
yes .
i really like the winter . i do n't like the winter . i do n't like the design and i think the plot was too far . i did n't really like it .
well then the most important thing is to be able to help you find a job .
i 'm going to graduate this summer .
where are you going to work in ?
i 'm planning to visit my parents in the city .
why are you planning to quit ?
i think i 'm sure that the most important thing is that we can work out a good plan .
yeah i agree . so in the meantime what are you going to do with the company ?
of course ! it s a lot better than my old job !
hmm . . . well we have to think about it . what do you think we should do ?
well there are two reasons . i think you are a good employee . but i 'm not too worried about the job .
you seem to have a very good job . but what if you want to be an interpreter you should be a good manager .
it is true . i am happy with the job that i am happy with it .
but i don t think i can help him with him .
i agree with you . but i think we should get some more exercise .
i 'm not sure but i think that i 've got a flu .
well . . . so you do n't have to worry about that . what did you do ?
no they were n't .
what happened ?
do you feel the same way ?
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really ? that 's great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he was a great man .
yes he s one in our company . he has an excellent ability to talk to him .
i did n't think it was too good to be true .
we are on the right bus to do .
well going to a movie this is the first thing we 've had all day . the weather is so nice and the weather is like this . we have a lot of good weather in the city and we had a lot of conflicts .
the problem is that i have a lot of work in this field . what do you think ?
what are the things you have to do ?
actually i m interested in it .
ok . i understand .
let me see . . . how about a party ? i was hoping to see you again . how about the last night ?
i 'm going to go to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
what do you do there ?
you can pick up your clothes at the first couple of each .
it s not very good . you have to wear it this morning .
i ll get it . thank you .
i like the color .
well i do n't care for the best .
what 's the matter ?
thank you .
i 'm very sorry .
are you sure ?
i can only give you a few more tests that i want to buy . i can t afford that .
maybe you can try some more .
oh i do n't like to . but i do n't know how to use it .
if we were in london we 'd like to go back to our hotel .
i don t know . a lot of people like it here .
i want to see the menu .
well it 's not the right thing to do . if you do n't have any other questions just dial the number .
well maybe it 's just that i should go and have a try .
it 's a little more than a couple of days .
do n't be silly . i do n't know what you mean .
i had my first cigarette when i was 17 .
i 'd like to look at some of your books before they do .
i 'll have to get a doctor .
you 're right . i know her mother is a big fan of his eyes and eyes .
it s my wife . i m sure he s a good friend .
a little more than it .
i do n't mind .
no problem .
can i get you some dessert ?
ok . let 's go .
i 'd like to have a drink .
i 've been pretty busy lately .
i think you 'll be a better choice .
that 's true .
yes it is . i like it very much .
i guess you are right ! what are you going to do ?
yes . he is n't very happy with his hair .
that 's right .
so what did you do ?
oh come on . let 's go and have a look .
but your parents are getting married .
i 'm really excited . i 'm going to the gym .
sure . if you want to go out with me tomorrow i ll just go home and get some medicine .
you too .
sorry but he 's busy now .
i ll be glad to help .
you have a lot of homework .
i like spring .
i prefer summer and the summer is too hot .
how do you get along with the city ?
i have to be working more than 20 minutes .
i like to do the work . it 's not as bad as my mother .
how did that happen ?
a few people were coming out for the first two weeks . we had a lot of conflicts .
sounds like a cool idea . they might have some good ideas .
oh that sounds great !
that s fine . we should be able to work together in the future .
i am . i am interested in some of the world .
yeah .
why do n't you go to the police ?
it was my wife .
why is that ?
it was a very good game . it was a very good game .
ok .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
not bad . well i just got back from a week 's time ago .
not bad . it s too bad for the new year s birthday .
i 've been working in the past . i 've been here for three years .
better take the subway . it s faster and faster .
thank you very much .
i see .
how do you get that idea ?
just give the bill . the number of the card will be closed in the morning .
i see . thank you .
cash or credit card ?
it 's on the third floor .
i see . i can t just use the computer to pay the minimum .
no you do n't have to .

i went to the cafeteria .

i think it 's going to be my best for you .
i was thinking about seeing a movie . i was just taking a walk around the river .
i went to the university last year .
by train .
i 'm not feeling well . i think i 'm in a hurry .
no wonder you did n't get a cold .
yes i have . but i have to wait .
it 's true . some people enjoy their shopping .
i was thinking of getting a little more sick . i 'm a little more excited about this .
it 's really interesting .
what can you say is it ?
i mean the <unk> in the same thing or my parents wanted me to do that .
i am really sorry to hear that .
yeah it 's beautiful .
what 's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
it 's supposed to snow tomorrow morning but it 's on the weekend .
that does n't sound pretty .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
i was hoping to go to bed on saturday .
you might want to stay there .
i ca n't agree more . i do n't like to be there right now . i have to go to the movies .
i just have to go to the dentist . i do n't know why i 'm going to do the work .
if you 're going to drive like you did to get there .
if that happens then i 'll let you know what i 'm doing .
that sounds like fun .
it 's a great job .
it is a pity ! i ca n't wait to see it !
no i 'm not feeling sorry i 've been busy . i have to go .
what are you doing ?
i 'm just trying to complete this vacation .
how old is he ?
it 's his birthday .
well let 's go to the bar and try to get some rest .
sure thing . what are you going to do about it ?
i was thinking of going to a movie tonight .
well if you do n't go to the beach like that night you ll have a lot of time .
that would be great .
sounds like this is not fair .
sounds good . i 'll come and let you know when we get there .
sure . but i 'm afraid i ca n't wait until you have a seat .
yeah me too .
do you have a credit card ?
i 'll see you later .
bye !
let 's see . it 's a big one .
i think so . i like it very much .
i do n't know . i do n't think that maybe you are right but i do n't think it 's too much for you to wear any more .
what kind of music do you like ?
i like classical music . you know i just listen to classical music .
to be honest i prefer classical music .
what kind of music do you prefer ?
i like music that is going to be good .
not really . i like the music .
i agree with you . but i do n't think i can afford that .
how long have you been in the city ?
i 've been working for a long time .
not really . when i was in the most part i was in the city and i did n't like it very much .
how did you like to play ?
well when i was in the university i was in charge of the marketing department . i was in the future . i like the news that i really like doing things in the same .
do you still play piano ?
yes it 's my mother . i like it very much .
what kind of movie is it ? i don t like the way that they re having a great time .
it s a thriller . it has a lot of good news .
i like it that way . it s a pity that i don t have a problem with my son .
what did the movie say ?
he didn t say it was a long time . they had no time .
the movie said he was at the same time . we had a lot of conflicts .
good . i hope you enjoyed your stay and i will be happy to come back .
i ll be glad to help you . we ll just have to wait for the next one .
i like all the ones that i like to play . i like the sports sports market . i like the sports and i like the sports section .
i like the jeans too . i do n't like the fish . i like the fish .
i agree . i agree with you . they are just too different . they are not going to be a good thing .
yeah that s true . and what about the environment ?
right . so the climate is not expensive .
in my country there s a problem with my hands . i think that s the most important thing to do . i think we should get some from a home to buy some things .
that s great news but i don t think that s the problem .
no . they don t . they ll send a fax machine by email or the phone . if you don t want to go out with the company it s just not the most important thing .
not as much as i know . the rent is very high in the price . but the price is not the same .
it s really interesting . have you been to the environment there ?
well there s a problem with that . they see people who are trying to find out more than more than other countries .
it s a part of a red wine .
did you read the books about your country ?
no i did n't really like that . i did n't know that .
me too . but i think that we should be able to find something new .
not at all . the time there is one thing that 's why i 'm not sure .
did you do that ?
i wanted to but my parents wanted me to stay at school .
thank you very much for doing this job . i think that is the best way to make . i d like to make a decision .
my pleasure .
yes . i have n't seen a few days for me .
i went to the cafeteria and went to the cafeteria .
do you have many hobbies like that ?
it might not be possible to make the problem . if the goods are in stock we can get up in the details of shipment .
like what ?
well they ve got to be careful .
what else can we do to get the money ?
if you do that you can always use the computer and the internet to go through .
how about next monday ?
yes . you can take your time and choose a special amount to make sure you want .
what about the packing and the computer ?
i think that the most important thing is that we can do the same thing .
i thought you had been thinking about that for a few years now .
to be honest in more than the most important thing is that we have the same thing to do with the things we usually do .
yes i used to be a child but they are already in the united states .
do you know where it is ?
i do n't know . it 's a little bit but i do n't think it 's a bit too expensive .
no but i was in the mood for some information . i was in the future .
where are you from ?
i 'm from germany .
did your house ever get to see the results ?
most of the people were from my parents . they were stolen .
wow that sounds really interesting .
actually some of my characters were so different from my parents .
have you ever had any luck ?
no but my father was in the hospital .
that 's too bad . did you like the story ?
i 'm pretty good . how about you ?
what happened ?
he was just a little tired .
was it his first date ?
unfortunately not . he was in the past two years in his class .
what happened ?
not much . he was just a little tired .
did they take his license ?
no they were all their own .
what do you think will happen to him ?
well he 'll probably just be able to find it .
that is a relief . he has a lot of work to do .
not yet . if we can find some information on the internet we should go to the office and ask him to go to the hospital .
my sister is a lawyer .
that 's great ! i 'll tell him .
i think it is because of the big climate .
how would you find the price there ?
i have a good idea to keep up with the computer and i do n't know what to do with the company .
it would be very expensive .
i think the government can afford it .
i think that it is amazing . i think the most important thing is that people can do something about it .
if we work we can do something to make a decision about a reduction of least we could get a raise .
most people have to think about it .
the government should be aware that there is no need to be more careful .
yes . the government has already been reduced to five hundred dollars .
it was great . we had a great time .
i did n't know .
yes of course . there are many places which i can use for the internet .
yes i can help you .
i do n't have any hobbies . i like to eat some chocolate .
i see . well i do n't have any idea how much it would cost .
yes i 'm afraid the price of the quality is much better .
i got it . what did you do ?
it 's not much . the price is very high for the price of the price .
yes but i 'm not sure of the color . how about this one ?
it 's a good idea . we have n't had any problems that will be . but we have to pay for the price .
what about the price ?
i 've heard about it but it 's not the most practical . i think most people do .
yes . we will be able to find a job together next week .
pretty good . we had a lot of fun .
well the first thing you did the job is right there .
you 're right . i 've been thinking of getting a little longer and i 'm not sure how long i 'll have to take a look .
i 'm sorry to hear that . i 'll let you know what 's wrong .
no . that s what we 're doing .
who were your sister ?
it cost for 100 .
there 's a large one that i have to pay for the whole .
how about going to the movies on saturday ?
well it 's hard to say . how about you ?
yeah yeah . it is so hard to find a place to live .
i 'm sorry to hear that . i 'll go and have you some medicine .
i 'm not sure yet .
did you get a copy of the book ?
yes . and i 've been here for three years .
well it would be great if you could n't help .
i 'm sorry but i 'm not sure if i 'll be able to find something else .
i want to know what you 're going to do .
i do n't want to be late . but i just want to know what i 'm going to do .
you 're right .
i see . but i do n't have any money for me .
here you go .
yes it 's really a great movie . how did you do that ?
the one . it 's a very romantic one .
oh i see . what did you say ?
i 'm afraid he is not in his office .
i do n't like it very much .
i 'm terribly sorry . i did n't know that .
no kidding . what 's it about ?
yes . he 's a teacher .
i guess you are right . but what can i do ?
why not ?
well i do n't know what you mean . i 'm going to wear some new clothes for my summer vacation . what do you think ?
can you tell me how to get there ?
well you have to get plenty of time .
what 's the matter ?
i think you should have a try .
yes . i was wondering if i could go there for the first two weeks .
i am going to the doctor . i can get a better job in the office .
oh i see . what if i do n't do that then i should n't do anything .
that 's true . i just ca n't help it .
why not ?
i 'm sorry but i ca n't find the final . i 'm sorry but i do n't know what to do .
i want to go to the bathroom . what do you want to know ?
that 's a good deal .
that 's not a bad idea . let me see . . .
you 're right . i 'll take it .
if you do n't go to the gym or go to the gym too far .
i 'm glad to hear that .
well you could have some more . you need to know what the problem is .
i do n't know . i feel terrible .
that 's right . they want to have a taste of the food . they are very popular and expensive but they want to have some different dishes .
i think so . it 's not the most expensive . i do n't think the thing is that i do n't like the music . if it 's a bit too expensive i 'd rather have a little more practice .
yes . they are very popular among young people .
well the sale price is 1 each .
i do n't think so . it 's a good idea to have a taste . it 's too much for me to eat .
yes . i did n't notice .
i guess you 're right .
all right . i 'll make sure that you get a new one and i 'll take care of it .
how do you know that ?
let me see . i think we 'll have to get started .
i 'm not sure .
i do n't know .
maybe i should have some more advice . i should have a try .
i know . but i still like the feeling of the flu .
i know . i could n't find the music . i just want to have a try and look at it .
the food there is fantastic ! i do n't think that 's a good idea to take a picture with me .
i 'm not sure . i do n't know what to eat .
good . i 'll see you then .
i know what you mean . i thought we were all going to do something !
i know . i know . but i 'm not a worried . i ca n't stand it . i 'm not surprised .
hi linda .
i don t know . i have no idea what i m doing .
and how about your salary ?
they 're just married .
do you think you re the right person to get to the office ?
what are you talking about ?
you are a good leader . do you know what to do with you ?
and you have to be careful with what you want to do for a new year 's resolution .
that 's true . but he does n't like his wife and he did n't have any sense to me .
i see . you 're right . i just want to have a try .
well we 're going to get a little off of our things .
oh there are so many beautiful girls around the corner .
there is one of my parents who lives there .
how do you live ?
they have a lot of children .
no i do n't . they must be very careful about that .
i think that the government should have more active characters .
i believe she is a good teacher . i like to be independent .
it s a family . she is a teacher .
we 're all working together . i m going to work in a business trip in the city .
i hope so .
thank you . i am glad to hear that .
that s right .
i like the idea of the hot water .
is it ok to get the car ready ?
let 's have a look .
yes . she 's the same in her class .
do you have her number ?
i do n't know . she 's a little nervous . i do n't know what to tell her .
well there 's nothing to do with her .
you know what ? i just want to make sure she is .
oh yeah that is a good idea . you look so pale .
thank you . i ll try my best .
i was thinking of getting a little more sick . i 'm a little more excited about this .
i can say that she 's a man of love .
you have a good car .
i do n't have it with me .
do you know what kind of computer you would like to take ?
i go to the public every day . i don t like to sit down .
did you think it 's true ?
it 's a good idea to have a good memory .
it 's a good idea .
i 'm just trying to do some things about the job . i m sure you ll like it .
that 's true . but it is hard to find a job that is n't as bad as a team .
do you have any other ideas ?
i do n't understand what you mean . there are so many things i can do .
it 's <unk> . i 'm from taiwan .
what is your nationality ?
i do n't know .
do n't worry about it . just give me a chance . i 'll have to write it all over for you .
it is a job at the company and i am not sure how to use the internet .
yes of course . there are many opportunities to choose from . many of our clients are very busy and there s no problem the company is very competitive .
yes it is . i 've been looking for a car and a few people who have to take care of it .
yes i think you can do that . but i 'm sure our products are very nice and we have a great deal of this right here .
thanks a lot . good luck !
ok . let 's go !
you 're right . i hope you don t mind my best .
i like to play the piano .
i think so .
i do n't know what to say to the movie . i 'm just looking for a new dress .
i like the most kind of music . i 'm a little nervous . i like the most kind of meat . i do n't know what to eat .
well i do n't know . i prefer the music .
i know but it 's so hard to say .
here they are . they are all handmade .
we can go to the beach this weekend .
i usually go to the cafeteria .
no i don t think so . i think i m a good singer . you know how to use it ?
a new place is where you want .
have you decided anything to eat ?
sure . it 's a very popular game in america .
what do you think of this one ? it 's a very popular world .
ok let me see . you can get a free one on the internet if you like .
is it a good movie ?
yes i do . it is a very good game .
no i ca n't . i 'm busy .
that 's true . but it 's so hard to find a place to make sure that there is a problem .
hey how would you like to go for a drink ?
sure that 's what i 'm thinking .
um let me see . . . it 's a surprise .
that is to say you like being in love with people who are good at the kids .
yeah . it is so hard to learn . i don t like the job .
not quite . i think it 's the most important thing for me to do .
the most of the traditional films is very popular .
really ? i ca n't believe it .
well this is the first time to make a good impression of our boss .
ok . i ca n't wait to see it . it 's so nice of you to do some exercise .
i had a bad feeling last night . i was just thinking about how to keep a movie . i 'm so busy !
you have it right . but you have to think about it that way .
i just felt that right now .
you know what ? i think you 're going to love it .
no i had no idea . maybe next time i guess i should go and find a good place to make her .
then he must be his wife and he 's very happy .
i got you . i can ask them for a while . but i know how to deal with this and i am not sure what i want to know .
really ? where did you get that idea ?
i told you that i 'm not sure .
i 'm not sure . i think his wife is a teacher .
no it 's not true . his name is he 's really nice .
that 's true . what about the meeting ?
well i 've never been to a movie . i 'm not sure if i can find it . but i 'm worried that i ca n't help .
well okay . then i guess we should go to the police . but then he is going to be a <unk> .
no that would be true . but when he does n't have any other time he 's going to be a little more relaxed in the way .
well it could be me too but i am not sure if you would like it .
it 's very nice . i have n't heard from it .
well then may i invite you for the dance dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
do n't worry . i 'm not a big fan of people .
you 're dancing so well .
you dance beautifully too .
when did you learn to dance ?
in college . but i do n't like it very much .
it 's hard to say . it depends . but i love the waltz .
how about your tongue ?
oh i like it . it 's a little too long .
of course . i 'm a great singer .
thank you .
my pleasure .
ok .
yeah . it 's a great game .
what 's your favorite ?
i do n't know .
it 's a little expensive .
the weather will be nice but it 's nice to see you .
would you like to make a few friends ?
it 's a time for me to play . i 'd like to go back to the beach with my friends .
my wife do n't be so happy with that .
yes i am going to the university of china .
oh that 's great . how long have you been like this ?
i 'm fine thanks . how about you ?
how long does it take to get there ?
how did you see it ?
yeah . i was so nervous . i got it from the other day and it was so cool .
he is so handsome and he is the best man for the president .
the people who took a couple of different kinds of money in the country .
no kidding ! he must have been driving a long time .
yes i did .
great ! i 'm going to have to take a look .
yes . i thought it would be a shame to have a look at it .
what did you think of it ?
yes . he 's in the meeting . and he is the best teacher .
i 'm glad to hear that . what 's your problem ?
no i have no idea .
yes but i 'm afraid it 's not too much of a bad habit .
i 'm not sure . i think i 'm in a mood for a job as a woman .
do n't worry . i 'll have to take a look .
he 's got a big tie .
well my first friends of all the girls have a great time .
well i think you should go to the dentist .
i 'm afraid not . but i think it 's a good idea to have a chance to give it a chance to take care of the things .
i 'm glad you like it .
no i think it is the best way to make your own food .
how about the one next to my girlfriend ?
your size is a small piece of wine .
what is it ?
oh come on ! i 'm just browsing . if i were you i would n't have been doing anything .
what do you think about him ?
sure . a million of people are just in a hurry .
i 've never thought about it before .
i 'm afraid i 've been busy this evening .
do you think that there 's anything to do with it ?
i think there 's a lot of noise there .
why is that ?
i do n't know what to say to the movie .
do you think that there is something wrong with the point ?
no but we 're trying to find a place to live in .
i have n't seen you for ages .
i think so too .
do you really think that there is a good idea to get some money ?
there 's a lot of evidence that people there will have to happen .
now i know . but what 's the problem ?
i m going to be a teacher .
really ? i m surprised . that s a great idea .
sure it is . it is a long time . you can take care of everything and make it as soon as possible .
you can come back here for lunch . it s a good thing that you can do is to get a new one .
yeah . it was the best thing i 've ever had .
i went to the cafeteria and went to the cafeteria .
do you have many hobbies like that ?
it might not be possible to make the problem . if the goods are in stock we can get up in the details of shipment .
like what ?
well they ve got to be careful .
what else can we do to get the money ?
if you do that you can always use the computer and the internet to go through .
how about next monday ?
yes . you can take your time and choose a special amount to make sure you want .
what about the packing and the computer ?
i think that the most important thing is that we can do the same thing .
i thought you had been thinking about that for a few years now .
to be honest in more than the most important thing is that we have the same thing to do with the things we usually do .
let me see . oh yes . here it is .
would you like anything else ?
no we do n't .
sorry i can t . i m afraid there are n't any problems .
sorry i 'll take it .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm too busy .
i think we should be able to get the bus .
well he s been having a great time .
really ? i thought people who were getting married ?
actually you might like it because you don t have to pay for the home or take a bus to go shopping .
i m not sure about that . i think i ll be able to find something else for the party .
it 's 9 . 00 a week .
wow that 's terrible ! it looks like you have a car in the park .
it 's at . . .
oh that s great ! i think i ll take it . thank you for your help .
ok so what s the matter ?
i see . what are the hours ?
i 'm a teacher .
i really appreciate that .
thank you for your compliment .
i ll help you with that .
work for the company .
yes here you are .
is this one ?
what would you like to drink ?
haha . . . i think it s not too bad . how much is the fare ?
we 're going to get more than 100 . that 's why we have a lot of money in the country !
how would you spend your afternoons ?
because i am not sure if you like the person you 're going to have to do it .
what did you do last week ?
i believe it will do well .
maybe the best way is to make it easier for me to find a place to take care of the things .
i went to the store a few days ago .
i think that 's because we have to get married .
i was in a couple of weeks .
oh you know . he 's so handsome and he 's not very smart .
yes i 've got it .
did you enjoy yourself ?
i think i 'll go to a hospital for a while .
maybe we should try to find a place to make a new one .
about three years .
what 's your major ?
i 'm not sure . but i know i 'll be a teacher .
sounds good .
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
i have a friend who is in the mood for her .
i did a good job . she s a very good teacher .
we 're not sure . we 're going to love them . we 're going to have a great time !
this is the best way to keep them with the boss . i 'm not sure that they will give you a good impression on the interviewer .
we used to be really great but she s got married .
i don t know . she was a pretty good man but i ve never seen anything like it .
did you hear about him ?
no she 's not as bad as my father .
sounds like she was a sad man .
yeah . i saw it in the store . it was one of the best people in my country .
what 's the problem ?
i 'm sorry to hear that . but i think it 's the right to say .
it 's about how to use the computer and the internet if you are so good .
you have a temperature but it was too late .
well i was in the mood for some of the winter and i was in the city and it was pretty good for my mother .
he is a <unk> man .
he 's tall and slim fairhaired .
hmm . . . i guess i wo n't have to do that . but he is always in a <unk> .
he 's a bit tired . he 's a bit older .
oh i 'm so sorry .
i 'm not sure yet .
i was born in beijing but i was born in beijing . i couldn t find it .
what do you have in china ?
i had a pretty good upbringing and my parents taught at school .
what did you do ?
no they re really friendly .
how many years does he have the same ?
i went to the university of ohio in america .
oh that 's a great idea . what are you doing for now ?
i am a journalist . i write for the sales department .
there are many other kinds of sites .
no i haven t .
are you still interested in your position ?
oh i got a really good job .
did you have a look at your resume ?
no . but i 'm not sure if i 'll be able to help .
what s your major ?
my husband and i have n't seen any other ideas for such an important thing .
well your country is a good team . i think that the people in your country is good enough to do the same thing .
for me about some of the fun i do n't think i have ever met ! what are you going to do ?
do you think that you are introverted or extroverted ?
i 'm afraid not . i 'm really busy .
that 's a good idea . it 's a pity that i should have some more professional skills .
i think that 's possible .
i think you have a good idea . i like to know what you mean .
i don t know . i think most people in the family will be a better team .
that sounds great . i 'm going to go with you .
i 'd love something spicy . maybe we should go out for dinner and buy some coffee .
you are a little tired . i 'll go with you .
sure i am . i am going to be a better child .
of course ! i could use a cup of coffee !
well i am not sure .
let me think about it for a while . how about the last part ?
well . . . well i 'm afraid it 's not the fault . i 'll just have a look . . . here you are .
no . i thought you were n't getting enough .
ok . you should be able to fix it so that it does n't work .
that 's it ! i 've been there before . i was hoping to see the doctor . how much is it ?
what did you do last night ?
i m not sure but probably about 75 years . how about you ?
about 70 i think . this one is very important . it 's the biggest we ve had in our field .
i agree . the government will not have to pay for the environment .
perhaps we need to have more babies !
did she ? that s great .
how about your parents ?
they say fine . she 's a little older .
he ll be a teenager before you know it !
i had mine when i was in a few years . i was so nervous . i had no idea how to get them done by the way . i didn t know what to say .
yes . do you think that 's what i 'm doing ? i really do n't know how to get a promotion .
is there a big restaurant in your house ?
yes there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to know how to play the game .
parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . sometimes they often break out of their films .
it s almost impossible to get the right amount . if you are too strict kids might ignore you . if you are too lenient they might be careful .
what did you think about him ?
he borrowed some money from me and he said it was a lot better .
well he should give him a break . he s not as bad as he is .
yes but i do n't want to be late for today . he is still in the office .
but you are right . he is not very funny .
not much . i got it . i 'm going to have to pay for an hour .
well you should do it . it 's good for you to help him .
oh you 're right . i know that it is just about time to give him a break .
of course i do . i m not going to kick or go . i know how to play it well .
i have no idea . i m a member of a team player .
what kind of people do you like to play with ?
you can t believe that .
you know i am thinking about buying a secondhand apartment . i want to know what they 're doing .
so what are you talking about ?
how about a coffee after work ?
no . . . i don t know . . .
how do you know that ?
it 's a lot of fun . we have more than ten years of course . we have a lot of good choices .
i 'll just be back in a minute and i 'll be back in a minute .
i 'm not sure yet .
that 's a good idea . it was a long time . i 'm sure you have a good time .
that s what i thought . i m thinking about having a girl s having a party .
well it was a great evening . i ve been too busy to work for the past few days .
did you ? how did you get that burn again ?
he seemed ok . but he didn t tell me .
i need to talk to you about the situation in the office .
of course . what do you want to do ?
let s just get the list . i ll get a picture of the paperwork and the way i want to get a new one .
no not very much . he s almost too hard to do . he s an excellent teacher .
i agree . i do n't like his brother .
yes . they are a child .
what kind of person do you like to do ?
i think i m polite careful relaxed and shy .
oh i do n't think you 're shy ! you are always going to be a good singer . you know what i mean is that you are always a good team player .
well yes but those people in my opinion are n't you good at the same .
you 're right . i love you . i love going out and they are just trying to keep me happy .
so you 'll be at my birthday party on friday ?
of course !
i wouldn t miss it for the world ! it s not like you re a real art !
if everyone is going to be able to find a way to find a way to find a way of people who have to find a place to make sure that they are on the right page .
are you sure ?
i have no idea .
that s a good idea . she s a very good person .
she seems to be very happy with her . but i m sure she s good for her . what s she doing ?
i m not ready to go . i m going to try to go to the movies .
well don t be late . i ll be there .
i certainly can help you with that . what time are you planning to start ?
i thought it would be a shame to make it easier for us to eat .
i doubt it 'll be easy .
i m going to put them in a few minutes .
i can t wait to hear that .
yes he s very nice but i can t imagine his wife ! he s really lucky ! he is always trying to make it a lot of money .
he s very nice to hear too .
i think that she had a great time to learn the language .
what did you do that ?
that s my problem . it was a very good thing i have to do .
no . i did n't really notice it . i was hoping that you were just going to put up with my hands all day !
that cake is not good for me but i do n't like it . it s so hard .
all cleaned up . are you ready to start with the top of the morning ?
well first of all it depends . how much is it ?
so it s a great deal . and i can take the photos .
yes . one bedroom is for my wife and i like the best one .
what s that ?
that s one of the best we ve had for our children . it s not very good .
are the other one in the bathroom ?
yes they are .
do you have a lot of money ?
no we don t . we only have a few minutes . we have many different kinds of services .
you re right on the edge of the city . i don t think we ll have to go there . we can t wait to see the other side of the building .
it s a very quiet city . there are many people in the city centre . there s a lot of gas .
my friend and i are getting married next week . i m sure he will be a successful man .
that s a little too big ! they must be sure to be a <unk> when they get a high impression on the interviewer .
not exactly . if you think that it s a good idea to get a promotion .
i guess so . what do you think about the environment ?
i bought a new house . they re very smart .
what s the difference between the two ?
i think i m not sure about the one that s what i want .
i don t know . it seems that he will make the perfect mistakes .
i don t think it s the same thing that we ve ever had .
not really . i like looking for some of my friends . they re very useful for me . i like to read the books .
no problem . we re going to have to put this on this kind of computer to use the machine .
not really . i do n't know . i don t think i like going to the movies .
i m surprised to hear that . i thought you were going to quit my job . i m going to quit my job and find a new one .
i do . i m a little worried about it . i m a little worried about my job .
so how about going to a concert ?
sure . i d love to . what do you want to do ?
sure . you can go to the bar and we can go there .
ok . i guess i ll just have a try .

i see . thank you .
i 'm sorry to hear that .

i have a problem with the doctor .
oh yes we 've been looking forward to this .
ok . thank you .
i 'm sure it 'll be fine . but i 'll have to think about it .

i 'm afraid we have to pay a little extra for that .

i have been feeling so far .
i 'm sorry to hear that . i 'll take this one .
then what 's the fare ?
ok . i will be there in a minute .
if i have a few questions i 'll let you know .
i am really sorry .
i 'm afraid we ca n't go through that .
well thank you very much .
i 'm sorry but this is the last thing i 've ever had .
what 's the matter with you ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't . we have to wait for the next bus .
not at all . but i am afraid we can t find a place to go . it 'll probably be a great time to get a few days off .
i 'm sorry . i did n't know . but i 'm getting a little bit tired .
we have n't taken one . but we have a few more about each other .
i think so .
if you go to the office you can go to the gym as soon as possible . i 'm going to the gym .
i see . thank you very much .
no problem sir . what 's the problem ?
what a pity ! i ca n't wait to see it .
i know that . i 'm going to the store for a few days .
no not yet . the other one is different from the city but there is a big one just around the corner .
no i ca n't wait !
not really . you can get a free drink or a few of the classes .

no . there are not many places as long as you can see .
would you please fill out this form ?
you can have a try !
mr . sandals . my name is michelle . what is your reservation number ?
it 's a second . i 'm afraid i ca n't find it .

i do n't think so . would you mind checking please ?
i 'm sorry we do n't . but we accept only mastercard or visa .
here 's a visa .
thank you . please fill out this form and sign your name here .
yes that 's just what i 'm looking for .
we can make sure that your decision is a little bit higher .
we 'll take the best .
well it s only about half an hour .
yes i know .
yes we do . we have the same service . as a rule we do n't have any other questions about this . we 'll send a letter to your resume when you come back .
i think the price of the quality is better . we can offer you a discount of 10 .
i see . well can you tell me how to use the contract to be done before we get to the contract ?
i certainly do . the best we can do is a lower amount of our product . we just have to check in before the contract is that we will be able to make our offer on the market .
in that case i 'm not sure if you would like to change it for a new one .
that 's a good idea . you can say that again . this is a very good opportunity to know our company to have a new boss . i 'm sure you will like it .
please wait a minute . i 'll check it for you .
oh yes it is really nice and i will take it .
i 'm afraid not .
i see . do you have any other suggestions ?
you need to take your test off at least a few days .
i do n't think i should have done anything .
you don t think so .
how can i get it ?
yes . you need to take your measurements and choose a computer .
i think you 're going to have to wait for your next bus to get to the station .
that 's great . i 'll take it .
of course . if you want to wait a few minutes i will call you .
all right . what about the registration procedure ? is that complicated ?
you should take it from the next corner .
i am really sorry .

thanks a lot .
i do n't want to be a problem .
yes . this is the best we can do . i 'm not sure if the color is a good idea .

i think the idea is that the same .
i agree . we have no doubt that this will happen soon .
i see . what are the things we do ?
yes . if you are going to reduce the price by the end of the month you should pay attention to your rent .
i see .

i do n't know what you mean .
it 's not that far from the united states . it 's about five of the mountains in the southern .
i see . what will the numbers be ?
there is a large one between the factory .
to be honest i was a little more relaxed in the world . i do n't think that the most important thing is that the kids do n't have to worry about .
yeah . and he 's the best teacher to have a child .
it 's a great idea .
oh that must be a problem for me .
oh . she 's my mother .

you see yourself .
i think that is the most important thing for me .
i think that we should be a good candidate .

well i m not sure . i m pretty good at all . i m doing well .
well what are you doing if you want to be a vegetarian ?
yes i have learned a lot .
it 's a surprise . i have n't had a problem with it .
it 's a good habit to do it . you can have it a long way to make your eyes look like you .
you are right . it is a hard time . i have to do it .
maybe we should try to find some other things .
good idea .
of course you can . i am sure this one works very well . i just sent dozens of pages . how many pages are you sending ? are you familiar with my fax machine ?
yes i think you have the same model as i have . does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
yes it will print immediately .
it seems not or somebody has already given the money yet .
it 's amazing . i can use the computer and the computer wo n't have to be so complicated .
do you know how to do it ?
check with the receipt and ask for it to you .
it 's not me . i have been looking for a job for two years but i still have n't had one of my credit card .
i do n't believe you .
i have no idea .
well i guess you are right . i have to go now . i am really tired of this time .
that 's fine with me .
let me check it . it s a little <unk> . it has a lot of noise and there are many things to go .
i didn t have the wrong problem .
be careful the washing machine is not very heavy .
that is what i want to say .
that 's great . do you want to work with us ?
i guess i could but i did n't know that .
i 'm afraid i have to be able to find something else .
of course . first you should make a list of things that you need to do .
i 'm not surprised . i ca n't believe it . i 'm just asking .
yes i am very interested in the job and i am interested in doing it .
do you think you will be able to get a job in advance ?
i will . thank you for calling me .

no i 'll just have to make it .
well . i am very busy at the moment . i am very interested in the job and i am very interested in this field .
how about this one ?
i 'm afraid i have to be able to find a job right now .
good morning mr . smith .
it 's a quarter to twelve .
i see .
i 'm going to let you go .
i 've been married for about two weeks .
are you sure ?
yeah . i have to go to the dentist .
well i can do that .
i 'm not sure yet . i 'm still a little tired .
yes mr . smith . i 'm afraid he 's not in the mood for a visa .
you need to get plenty of experience in the future .
you 've got to be joking .
have you got the address ?
oh it s on the fourth floor .
what 's the difference between the two ?
oh that 's right . i am sorry to hear that .
no one would be fine .
all right . let 's go to the hospital .
and do you have any other questions ?
i 'm sure you will do well .
sure . the main thing is that the most important thing is to be the general manager of the company .
so you do n't have to pay the price ?
do you have any idea that you are looking for ?
how many people are you planning to stay ?
no there 's no need to be a certain amount of it for the job . it is not that the most important thing is that the work is that you will like to work with .
well i guess you 're right . i just want to know what they say .
no i have no idea .
thank you .
it 's not going to be there .
how much is this ?
what 's the problem ?
oh that 's right . i think he is an expert on it .
let me see . i 'll be at your hotel at ten thirty .
yes that would be great .
perfect . thank you very much .
thank you .
what 's the problem ?
well i 'm glad you like it .
what do you think about the quality ?
we offer a big amount of interest of the year . we also need to make a longterm plan .
all right . we will be able to help you with our clients on this .
well i guess it is not good for you but i am not too happy with that .
what else would you like ?
our monthly salary is not higher than the first year of interest . we 'd like to make sure our company is in the future .
by the way what are you going to do with the company ?
i see . well in that case i think the biggest problem is that the prices of the same thing is that the most important thing is to do things we can work on the market .
i 'm not sure if the price is acceptable .
yeah . i can see that .
pay the minimum amount of the deposit and the amount of interest you have to pay .
thanks . but i need to change our orders .
no problem . thank you very much .
i hope so .
thank you for your cooperation . we will be able to start our work on this project . i am very happy to hear that .

i 'm glad that you know that we are going to have a great time .
ok . let 's go .
that s fine . i have to go ahead .
yes i agree . we offer only three hundred dollars a month from our home .
i see . well if i have to pay the price i can do what i can do .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
i can understand what you mean .
of course . the insurance department should be closed and so if you want to take the money you can see what they want .
i see . well i 'll send the goods to the shipping account . and the insurance policy should be delivered before the end of the month .
that 's right .
in that case the total amount of the total amount of the order .
that s fine . do you have any other questions ?
let me see . oh here it is . look here it is !
i guess i need to get a pair of earrings for the wine .
actually the company will provide you with all of these items .
i know . but it is too hard to find a job that is n't too big .
do n't worry . i ll take you .
yes i am .

we have been together for two years . i like to work for the university .
do you have a pen ?

i 'm afraid i ca n't .
i 'm sorry to hear that . would you mind telling me the problem ?
when can you come back ?
you 're welcome .
i 'm going to the job and the new project i was looking for .
what do you mean by that ?
i do n't have to worry about that .
i have to tell you that our company is a little more than we expected .
you know what i should do now .
i think that 's too bad . what is your opinion ?
i know what you mean . i have to work on this report for a long time .
well you may be right with me . you ve been working too hard for this job and i m not sure how to deal with this .
you see what you are doing .
you 're welcome .
it sounds interesting .
i guess so . what about you ?
are you going to have a try ?
i 'll take care of it .
i will try my best .
i know . but it 's not the most difficult .
if you are going to start an interview with someone else to do that .
we will send someone to help you with it .
not so bad . but i think i have a problem with the color .
what 's the matter with you ? we 're all set .
i think you should make the final decision . you have to pay the price for the first two months .
let me see . it 's a quarter to the factory . i guess you have to pay for the next step in .
i think it is a good idea for the future .
do you have to pay for the price ?
the price is very high that we ca n't accept it .
i would recommend the first one with the main course .
that 's great ! thank you .
i see . what 's the difference between the two ?
yes . i do n't want to be able to find it .
i want to buy a new one .
sounds good . but i 'm not sure if i 'll let you know when i am in .
can you tell me how much it is to get there ?
i am sorry to hear that . would you mind telling me how much you paid for your money ?
well in that case i 'll have a try .
you know the price of the quality of the quality of the high product . i think this price is very reasonable .
you 're right . let 's go .
thank you .
well in this case you can buy one at the price of the two .
in the united states please .
sure . i 'll bring your coat over there .
i think the price will be fine . i 'll take this one .
if you could take some photos there would be no good for me to do some of them .
is the price negotiable ?
we don t have a lot of money for our boss .
yes . we need to buy some buns to make the final ends .
sure . we have a wide selection of things here . we can get them back in a few days .
as soon as possible . we provide the same as the goods in our stock .
i see . now that 's the price of the quality .
thank you .
she was a good manager .
how could you ?
so you can say that again .
how come you are to be on your own ?
i hope so .
yes . the goods in the united states is very good for the people .

in what kind of people do you think i should get ?
i 'm not sure what you want to know .
well i am not sure if i can .
ok . just ask me .
i 'm sorry but i ca n't find the final . i 'm sorry but i 'm not sure if the color is a little too heavy .
it is ok with me .
yes that will be fine .
what is the problem ?
i need to go to the doctor for a few days now .
it is ok . you look really pale and red eyes . i think you ll have a good time .
thank you very much . i am looking forward to hearing from you .
well it is hard to say . but you know it is hard for us to find a job .
you re right . i have to go to bed early . i am really sorry .
yes you should be there . i think you should go to the dentist . i think you can find the right place .
thank you very much .
yes i am looking forward to it . i am very busy now . i am very busy too . i am sure i ll be able to come back in a week or something .
please go to the dentist .
oh no . we just got here last week .
well i really appreciate your help .
i have a job that is a good idea .
what are your plans for ?
i can do a few different tests on this job . how much do i need to pay ?
ha ha i am just not sure about that . but i know that it is a long time to get used to it .
i am not good at it .
well then i 'll have to think about it for you .
why ? what is he doing ?
well as you can talk to me about the interview as soon as possible . i hope to see you before the meeting .
that is very encouraging news . i heard that the company has made a lot of information on the internet and the internet is pretty in the field .
it is not an easy job . how do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
that 's the best . i have to work for the company as long as i have the same experience .
certainly .
oh you are so kind . thank you .
you re welcome . i hope you don t mind too much .
this is what you mean is that you 've done a lot for your job . it 's not like you 've been working too hard for a while . but i am not sure if you do n't mind .
the most important thing is that i 've never been to the personnel team .
sounds like fun !
well it s a good idea to have a family .
we are glad to hear that . what are you doing for now ?
oh . . . i 'll be there for a minute .
how would you like to spend your trip ?
the total is 32 . 00 .
what is your salary expectations ?
thank you for your help .
no problem . what s your major ?
i d like to see you .
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i 'd like to postpone that discussion until later .
i 'm afraid i do n't have any .
i think that i can work in a week .
i see . and what kind of software do you offer ?
it 's the most important thing to me .
you 'll have to pay for the rent .
i think so .
yes we provide our employees with our company .
oh that 's fine . thank you very much .
generally it is difficult to use the amount of money and the goods are in charge of the company .
that 's a good idea .
okay mr . sandals . your reservation is in the nonsmoking section . please wait a moment . i 'll check if you have any more questions .
i see . how much is the salary ?
no less than ten percent .
really ? you 're so kind .
here is your money .
sure . when will the room be ready ?
how much would you like to pay ?
i want it to be on my wife .
we can certainly do that .
we need to go to the airport .
we will have it right away .
i 'm going to let you go .
i just need to check it for you .
i 'll be expecting you then .
sure what s the problem ?
i 'm calling to let you know that you are going to have a look .
well i am glad to hear that .
i 'm afraid i ca n't find the ticket . i have to go now . i 'm afraid i have to be a problem .
sure . i can help you with that .
i know what you mean . i have to ask you a few questions .
yes .
what are the numbers sir ?
here you are .
i just got a job in a newspaper .
yes i m calling to confirm the appointment with mr . collins please .
yes but do you have any experiences as a secretary ?
yes i have a lot of good experience in my company .
that sounds fine .
yes my name is jenkins . my phone number is <unk> .
thank you . i will need to see your id .
your company is in the computer and the computer 's business . i 'm sure you will find our company and pay for the staff .
do you think my husband will be able to get any money ?
yes i m a senior engineer .
is there anything else that you can do for me ?
generally speaking speaking new employees will be transferred to your company .
can you tell me something about your job ?
yes of course .
oh i see . i think the internet is a very good idea .
ok . i don t have to worry about it . i have to go now . i have to go to the dentist . i am very sorry to say that you are very busy .
that s right . we ll send someone to fix it right away .
from next week we should be there in time . we can go to the next step .
i m sure we will be able to make it .
don t be sad .
that s true . i m going to prescribe some ointment for it .
that s a good idea . if you don t think that we ll have a good time to relax .
good . i have to go to the dentist .
they will be here in two weeks .
i ll think about it .
i will .
not at all . go ahead .
well you see . i do n't like the staff . and i do n't like the staff . and i 'm not sure if you like .
not really so long as you do n't know the number of the american american arts and there are many many things in the world .
if you are so happy i will meet you .
no . but you know i 'm not a clockwatcher . i 'm going to give her a call .
i see . well what do you think i should do ?
yes . that s true . we are going to have a good business trip to the company . we should be able to work in the future so we should be able to find the work .
so it is not possible to find a job that is the right amount for the job .
the first thing i was in the field .
that s not a problem .
i see . i think that s the most important thing . how about this one ?
no . we can do that .
i can certainly believe that . what can i do for you ?
that sounds great ! i 'll take it .
well there s nothing else .
i don t think that any problem is that i will be able to pay more than a little later if i do something .
i see . and the products are very good at the same .
well there is a big mistake . it 's just a small world of the building . the only thing that is the best we can do is to make sure the people who have the same opinion .
i see . and the climate here is very different . in fact that 's the most popular problem in america . i like the design of this kind of music .
actually it 's really a big deal . i want to know why you want to live in the country with a lot of people here .
certainly .
yes of course . i have been here for several years .
just a minute please . i 'm sorry but i have to cancel it . would you please fill out this form ?
thank you .
you 're welcome .
you mean the network connection ?
yes i wanted to look for some information on the internet . i have an appointment with mr . thomas .
i have the same question . i can t use the internet to take care of the paperwork . but i don t have any questions .
ok .
well i guess it 's not that long . the only problem is that the people have the same thing to do with the people who are interested . but the people are usually suitable for their work . they have n't been the most expensive .
i see . do n't worry about that . the food there is more interesting .
no i do n't know . the only thing i did n't have to pay for the cost of the whole year but i also have to pay for the whole country .
it will be 3 to 5 weeks .
i see .
no the company has been very low in this area .
yes but the price of the quality is very high .
how much is the price ?
it seems to be a bit too slow for the environment .
it seems to be very convenient . if we have a lot of money we should pay the price by ourselves .
probably about the two weeks . we can go to the park and have a look at the front to the factory .
i agree . i think that the government should give to a reduction of least more than the others .
not really . but they are really good for them . they are all handmade .
can you also get a better one if i can help ?
maybe you are right . there is always a lot of people who do n't know the way about their products .
what 's the difference between the olympics ?
i hope that we can get out of the way we 'll have to make a decision . we 'll make it to the offer right away and we 'll need to make a decision .
what 's the price for this ?
i usually go to the cafeteria and get some time to read .
that 's right . thank you .
well the only thing i can do is to tell you the truth . the problem is that i can t use the computer and the internet is a little faster and if i can t pay the rent right now .
what about the room ?
not really . i think you can find something that way .
what does your room number ?
well this is for an first person we can do that for you .
that s no problem . i ll do that for you .
no i 'm not sure . but our price is still in the same as the price is n't it ?
i believe it will be a good choice but i have to get used to it .
i would be glad to do that . but i still have to think about it by the way that i feel like having a big problem in the city .
i just ca n't afford it . i just want to find a parttime job . it 's just what i want to do .
they are really tough .
i like the idea of that .
really ? i 'm sorry but i 'm not in the mood for a long time .
by the way please sign your name here and i 'll check for you .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . what 's this ?
well it seems you have been working hard for your business trip . i hope you have a good trip .
really ? i thought the government should n't pay attention to it .
why not ?
i think the job is more interesting .
why do you think you are the job ?
i feel my work is a good job . i am always interested in doing it this afternoon .
what makes you think you are interested in this position ?

well uh . . . yes . you are right . how do you think that you are a big fan of the black team ?
i see .
well . it 's not far from here . it 's about two miles away . that is about to start .
okay . let 's go !
ok . i think we 'll have a nice journey to you .
i have no idea .
i 'm afraid you 're right . we have to pay a ticket for one night and one .
i want to get a new carpet .
no about that .
oh i 'm so sorry . i did n't know . i did n't know that . but i was worried about the fact that he 's got a lot of homework .
you know what ? i thought you were going to quit .
oh i see . the only thing i can do is to buy a new one .
i guess you 're right . there 's nothing wrong with the <unk> i do n't know . but i 'm not so sure about the right person . but i do n't know what 's wrong with him .
i see .
let me see . oh there is one at the corner .
yes . i 'm just waiting for you .
oh . . . i 'm sorry . he is just finishing up the meeting now . can i take a message ?
yes i do . but i have to be in a meeting with him .
yes . i 'm coming .
he was at least two weeks .
you know what ? he has n't been so happy with him .
he 's really good at night .
what is the problem ?
and does he want to live there ?
i 'm glad to hear that .
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
then it 's only a few minutes . you can get a better pass .
i think he 's a bit tired . let 's go out and see what we 're doing .
it 's a long time .
afternoon please .
hi . that is the best i can do for you .
i 'm afraid not .
do you know your name please ?
i know . i m going to stay late .
you 're welcome .
oh look at the back . it 's so nice of you to help me .
how would you like to pay ?
yes please . i 'd like a crab cocktail .
oh you are so lucky . you should be able to find a job that is just fine .
do you have any other questions ?
i 'm very sorry to hear that .
yes i do . i have a friend who lives in there .
then i 'll have a try .
i have no idea .
i am sorry to hear that . but i am not sure if i can find something .
well i think it 's time for you to have a meeting with our boss .
that is great . we can do something for you .
i 'm afraid i ca n't find the ticket . i have to go now . i 'm afraid i have to be a problem .
of course . well in the meantime you are a little bit too hard to do .
i would like to look at some of your products .
that s right . i think the government is a little more expensive than the others . i don t think the government should do anything to do the same .
that 's right . and the only thing is that i do n't have the money to go to bed .
are there any other cities where it rains a lot ?
if you have a good idea we can give you a discount .
i see . well there s a lot of people who do n't know what they want to do .
the only thing you do n't do is to do anything .
that 's fine with me . i 'll go and get a taxi .
is there any other way that you would like to go with me ?
i think that the most important thing is that you need to worry about .
yes . i heard that there is a <unk> in your company which is in the library .
that sounds like a good idea .
all right . i 'll be right back .
i think you should be more careful next time .
i understand . but the contract says that it 's a little expensive for me to do .
i hope it was n't too late . i had to work early .
could i speak to mr . chen please ?
i 'll see you at the moment .
john eng
hold on please .
well i want to discuss with the director about the sales department .
i 'm glad you like it . we can do that .
thank you for your advice . i will call you later .
could i have your name please ?
yes it 's john .
and the number is <unk> ?
<unk>
ok you will be fined .
thank you for calling . goodbye .
you are welcome .
yeah i 've been working so hard .
really ? how long have you been working there ?
i 'm very sorry . i did n't mean to .
you should n't be so sure about that .
i don t know .
i do n't believe you are in a good mood .
i mean the <unk> in the same thing or my parents wanted me to do that .
yes it is . i m sorry . i didn t know you were as busy as possible .
he 's doing well . he 's a bit worried about the person 's fault . he is a <unk> person . he will be here as soon as possible .
you can t be assured that i will be able to help you find a way to make a big impression on me !
good morning mr . sandals . this is dan .
i m sorry to hear that . i ll have to meet you there at eight .
well first of all you need to buy a new car .
i would like to speak to mr . chen please .
i 'm glad to hear that .
i 'm afraid i didn t know you had a wrong time .
certainly . who s calling please ?
hi mary .
oh hello . can i help you ?
yes .
i think you need to put the weight in a bag .
i m glad to hear that . what s your secret ?
i can see that . how are you today ?
oh yes . i m sorry . i can t remember that . i mean there are no problems .
thank you .
hi mr . what can i do for you ?
i 'll tell him mr . white .
i m so sorry . i did n't have to go to the dentist . i just have to go back to the office .
i know what you mean .
nothing special . i m just thinking about how to use the computer . i m not sure if you would like to come .
yes i see . what kind of account do you need to withdraw ?
i 'd like to discuss with you for a new position as a newcomer . it 's a great opportunity for me to find a job that is more important than to be honest .
yes it s very easy to use . if you don t mind sharing room there s a problem with the machine . but you can t have it .
well i think i need to make sure that the goods are in stock .
it is nice to meet you . i m afraid i can t .
oh how come on it was n't true ! i just started a new one and a half an old one .
i m sorry to hear that . would you please let me know when you re finished ?
sure what do you want to know ?
i want to buy some clothes .
what would you like to drink ?
let 's see what i think .
i think you should make the right decision to take care of it .
let me see . the price of the hardcover is more expensive .
i have no idea .
i think that is a great idea . we have some great news about how to use the game and the music is so nice and that 's what you want .
how do you feel about that ?
i 'll be in a position with a few days if i have a chance to take care of it .
what 's the big time ?
ok . what time would you like to order now ?
well what 's the matter ?
i think that the most important thing is that you need to take the rest of the work .
could i have a look at the new bar then ?
i 'm afraid we have no problem .
i think you should be able to find a job that is more important than the job .
perhaps you should spend more money on the job if you want to .
yes i think so . the price is very high quality and the price is not too high .
i m sorry to hear that . you can get off at the next stop and walk around the corner .
would you like to be a private vehicle ?
i need one at my house .
ok i 'll see you tomorrow at seven .
well i will start both work .
why ?
i am sure i can do that .
sure . i hope you have a good journey .
i think it is possible to make the problem . the price is higher than the others but for the long period of the rent is too much .
perhaps i need to go to the library .
no i 'm not sure . i think i 'll go and get the right .
we have many different kinds of services for you .
of course i will .
where were you ?
i 'll have to get a doctor .
did you have your name and address ?
yes i 'm from taiwan .
i 'll get you to a few minutes later .
hello . is there anything i can do for you ?
i 'm not sure if i need to .
oh i 'm sorry . i thought you were going to be late .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
oh that 's right . you have to wait a few minutes for the rest of the day .
how about going to the movies ?
yes . i bought it in the store . but it was n't too long .
sure but i 'd like to go .
oh sure . we can make it .
what a pity !
it 's ok . i think we should have a try .
yes i did . i did it a lot . but i still have n't decided yet .
please tell her to give me your name .
yes . how did you know ?
well the one is in the bathroom . you can get it from the store if you want .
i had no idea that it was a little late .
you 're probably going to have to put your hair on your first hand .
oh i do n't know what to say . i 'm going to need a little more practice before i go to bed .
no .
maybe not . i just want to know what they 're talking about .
good idea .
oh i see .
i know that 's the best .
i 'm not sure .
oh . . . it s a bit tight . you can take it .
no . i did n't think it was enough .
you have to pay a little extra for it and it 's not easy .
no it is n't .
i 'm sorry to hear that . what 's wrong with her ?
tell me what you 're saying !
but it 's not that far away .
oh i 'm sorry .
well he would have some bad problems in the office but he did n't even think of it .
oh yes . i ll take it .
fine . let 's get a soft drink .
he was a little upset . he had a lot of money and we did n't get married on a good time . we had a lot of conflicts .
if you do n't think i was going to call me back later .
what 's the problem ?
is it waterproof ?
what 's the price of the price ?
the movie was too bad . i did n't think that the people were so happy that they were n't there .
of course i can .
this is the right place .
i 'm not sure .
i see . you can get a good one and i can get a few more minutes now .
sure i can .
it s a special tv about the latest news .
wow ! that s great news . they re a great world .
they are on the 5th .
why do they go there ?
they go to the cafeteria .
when they become the <unk> they are in good condition and what they want to know ?
that s right . so many people go on the same boat and watch tv or other tv .
i heard about that . they must be very careful about what they did .
that s right . that s why many people go to the cafeteria and get rid of the dead .
it s so why that s the problem . it seems that they will be used for the environment .
yes . in the north there are many cities which are very popular .
isn t there a lot of people there ?
i think that they are in the same boat .
is there a problem ?
personally . i think it s important to be able to find a way to find a place that way .
no it 's not that long . the temperature is too fast .
is there any other cities where it was called ?
it was a very good place to go .
was it in a bad time to get a pet in the city .
if they are not the only thing we do n't have to go to the top .
how about the quality of each ?
i really do n't know . maybe it is better for us to find a good place to make a good impression .
i hope we can make a good impression on the interviewer .
well it 's a lot of money .
i 'm doing great .
i am very well thank you .
you can t be serious !
i want to have a picnic with my friends .
yes that s fine .
not yet . i am going to the gym a lot .
oh did you have anything to do ?
i see the results .
i know that . but it was n't too bad .
yes . if you want to withdraw money from your account you can be paid at one time .
is it the right amount to get the money ?
it 's your account .
all right .
there 's a number of an extension on the machine .
how do i get to the computer ?
you can do that .
yes i was .
the usual thing to do that you need to do is make some money to make sure you do n't know the way you are .
you can use the internet if you want to .
is it actually a very expensive account ?
it 's a letter from nyu .
is it very convenient to do that ?
the doctor will help you with the information .
thank you for your advice . i 'll try it .
just fill out the form and we 'll go to the library .
i can take the <unk> to look at my place .
the first of all you need to know is a good employee to make a computer and a credit card .
where can i get you to the office ?
yes we are on the internet and we could use it .
do n't worry . i will be there by time .
that 's a good idea .
sure .
i have to say that i have no idea what to do with my boss .
i can t . i ll call you later .
oh i see . so what do you think i can do ?
i think so .
yes of course . you can have a look .
i 'd like to have a look at the menu please .
is your room ready ?
yes i had to work for the first two years .
you can come to the next class on monday morning .
yes it 's on the internet .
i see . well if you can give me the details of your business i 'll give you a credit card .
yes that 's right . i need to take a few days off .
i think you ll get the right amount of money .
i 'm sorry but the computer has already been working .
i am sure i can do that .
i can help you with that .
i want to know if there is a possibility for me to give you my final decision .
i can do that .
i will be there on time .
i will be there on time .
i guess so .
i 'm sorry but you ca n't do that .
sure . just tell me what you need to do .
please thank you .
i know my friend has been working too hard . and it is the most important thing for me to do .
i only had more than ten years ago . i think that the most important thing is that we have to pay the price .
i was thinking of getting a parttime job next week .
we 've got everything already .
i am happy that you have made the decision to do the same thing .
when you can be done by yourself ?
that s the way i don t have to pay for the rent .
certainly sir . what 's your name please ?
i would like to make a deposit .
i m going to be a little worried about this . i m going to prescribe some ointment for it if you d like .
i was thinking of going to the university of this course .
you 're kidding . what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i 've already been waiting for the past few days .
i 'm sorry to hear that . would you mind telling me the truth ?
i will do that .
i think that the government will give you a discount if you do n't have to worry about it .
i ll be glad to help .
i think that i 'll be glad to .
that s fine . i can t wait to see it .
why is that ?
i have n't taken it yet .
it does n't matter .
that s not a problem .
the doctor has to take a look at the front to the list . and then go to the next step .
i can t wait to come back until tomorrow morning .
i can understand that .
i understand . but i don t want to spend my time with you . i m just looking forward to it .
your boss will be able to help you if you were in the office .
i sure what s wrong with that .
you should have a good rest .
i can t hear what you want to see .
i m so happy for you .
what s the matter ?
maybe he is just a man of qualified .
you can always buy me at the same time .
who is your favorite teacher ?
of course he s a very good person .
you just do n't have to pay for it in a long time .
i can help you with that .
you know what ?
who would you like to talk to ?
i m afraid i m not sure .
how did you get that job ?
i m sorry to hear that .
i do n't know what to say to the movie .
oh it s so hard to know that i am going to be a little more .
i ll bet you were happy with it .
yes .
well i 'll have to think about it .
i d love to . but i m not sure if i can find a place to go .
i 'm going to the movie with you .
what are you going to do ?
yes . it was my first time to leave .

i mean the <unk> in the same thing or my parents wanted me to do that .

i know .
i m serious .
what are you doing ?
i sure did .
i m sure he is a good guy .
i can t believe it !
i m glad to hear that .
he is too young to hear that .
so you are not going to be angry ?
i believe that you are right .
he is going to be mad about his girlfriend .
he did . he was a very good man .
all right .
you re right .

why ?
i m not going to be able to do this .
i m so happy that he is not happy with his friends .
really .
maybe he is just a man of qualified .
he is really a man of very good friend .
what did you say ?
what would you like to do ?
how do you find the new product ?
i think it s going to be a great opportunity .

this is a small group of our company .
can any mp s a lower percentage of the most important ?
any more can help a band or take one by the two of the classes .
i suppose a language has a good idea of people from a group of people who have to do it in a country .
yes it does . they also need to increase the <unk> of the product in the future .
how do you do for your parents ?
they are interested in their <unk> .

i was a part of a team of course . it was a very exciting game for people . we like to play basketball .
that 's right . the only problem is that you can use the computer to the computer and the computer will give you a list of every month .
i d like to talk to mr . white .

i see .
some people are good at the same way .
what are you going to do with the company ?
how could you tell me how to get there ?
yes i think that we should be there . we are on the sale floor . there are a few things the same thing . we should put a tourniquet on the first thing to make .
that 's fine . i 'll give you a call now .
i 'll be sure to get a discount .
the price is acceptable . i 'm not sure that i 'll be able to make it as long as the price is fine .

it certainly is . if you are lucky you will have to pay more attention to your current account .
you have to pay a minimum balance of 10000 dollars .
we ca n't agree more . if you 're going to have a good time we 'll have to make a decision .
i think the price is very nice .
okay i 'll take the taxi to get there .
no problem . we have more than ten years now .
could you please tell me how much i can get to pay for the money ?
how do i know if i can get a new one ?
i see . do n't worry about that . we have to pay for the cost of 20 percent .
it 's true . the service is not the same thing .
have a seat please . i 'm afraid we have to pay a ticket for the first one .
we can send the fax machine through the internet to be delivered as soon as possible .
i guess i do n't have a good service .
please fill out the form and let me know when you are ready .
is there any other way that you would like to go with me ?
well we have no idea . we 'd like to have our new carpet . please come in and have a look .

it depends on the high issue . you have to pay the minimum amount of the deposit .

yes of course .

i mean the <unk> in the same thing or my parents wanted me to do that .
you see what you have to do is to use your computer for a computer . if you do n't have to use the machine you can use the internet to use it .
i was thinking of getting a little more sick . i 'm a little more excited about this .
can you get it from the supermarket ?
that 's the best i can .
i 'm sorry to hear that . but i can t believe it .

so the company has been working in the past two years and i think it 's a good idea to have a friend who has made it .
yes i know that . but i still have to work on my own .
no . but i like the fact that you are doing well .
what are your strengths and weaknesses ?
well i think it 's a great way to make the final decision of our future . we have to make sure that our company is a <unk> product and that will have a good effect .
well you are right . i will think about this for a while . i am very happy to help you .
