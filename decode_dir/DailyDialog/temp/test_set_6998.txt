i usually go to the movies .
well i heard that a lot about that type of film .
it 's a world of architecture .
that 's great . i 'll take it .

it does n't seem to be a good shot .

i 'm afraid i ca n't fall in the middle of it .
you mean you did n't give up your face to you ?
i know . i just saw the <unk> yesterday .
that 's no good to be . no one has to be good .
i got it . i 'll give my my nose to my face .

thank you for your compliment .
i 'm a little nervous .
it 's hard to say . but i do n't like it very much .

i think the government should fix the problems .
i 'm afraid it is impossible to prevent the environment .
i like the lasagna .
that 's a good idea . but we do n't think we can get a good price by ourselves .
you can use the car .
how about recycling ?
yes . the biggest biggest difference is that you should ensure the biggest biggest deal is your life .

i ve thought about it but what is it ?
that 's a good idea . they 've decided that they 've decided to go to the company .
i do n't think they are a big child .
that 's why you need to learn so much about what you need to do .
i do n't know . i think i 'd like to .
what did you feel about ?
i know but i do n't think there are many people in the country .
i know . but i ca n't agree with you .

he 's fine .
that 's a good idea . i know it 's a good idea .
i think you might be a little more independent .
yes . i think i 'd like to see a big view .
that 's a good idea .
not always . they grow up in the same country .
i think that they want to live in a different world .
that s why you should try it .
did he ask you to give him a hand ?
i just wanted to see if i could n't find something wrong with it .
i see . maybe you should ask him to give him a call .
i know . but i have to pay for it .
but you are not sure . he s very angry .
i borrowed it from my bank account .
it 's no use .
you re right . it s no good to hear .
i think you re right .
i have always wanted to be a senior engineer .
that sounds like fun .
that is a big sale . i think that is a very rough idea .
i know . i know that . but i still have to find a place to do .
that s a good idea .
i don t feel like sharing my knowledge .
well i am not the type . i know they are just the ones that i got from the bottom of my heart .
