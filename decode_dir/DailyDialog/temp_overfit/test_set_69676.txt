i do n't think you have any more sleep for getting up . especially not some exercise these days .

oh it 's going to be a doctor . i am sure you could do it .
i guess you should eat a plate then .
perhaps you should excercise more . why do n't you go to an exercise class .
i never thought about it that way .
i 'm not sure . medium i suppose . maybe a little on the heavy side . i feel out of the weight .
what about the chicken ?
how about 15 percent ? it is too difficult to consider a healthy way .
what 's your favorite flavor ?
here is one hundred .
do you like some stuffed bun ? it 's delicious too .
i changed my mind . i eat a lot more tofu and some friends .

did n't i tell you ? it 's been a long time ago .
yeah . how about your other siblings ?
if you could just talk to him i would greatly appreciate it .
that 's fine . by the way please have a good rest .
yes i 'm excited to hear about your new product .
i 'm afraid you are too busy . there is a problem with your baggage claim and your price is too high . so i can see your passport and we are looking for you .
what a pity .
sure . it s on the second floor .
ok . how much is the house ?
two stops after the one .
all right . i 'll have the same thing .
let 's just park here .
i think they will .
yes i have . it is very dangerous .
you re right . many men like their own wedding and children have a child for their dog !
i need it for some time .
of course i will need to know the reservation number .
yes the maximum is 1000 . you can have the original price . so it s the same difference in my current account .
i 'm sorry mr . lee . we 've just gone through the boxes for the first step .
we can provide you with all of these supplies . we also have this kind of software and the employee will pay directly to the person s account of savings and your own account .
all right .
yes it s really the best job i ve ever had . i m sure you will love what i m doing .
that 's a great idea . the great wall has a small forest fire and a lively atmosphere . people are very quiet in the city .
yes i know what you mean . it 's hard to do anything about a place to live .
and they 're also so thin . they 'll get a copy of the city for the summer .
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
which bus should i take ?
every five minutes .
then we 'll go to the airport .
i sure can . you can take a bus .
how long will it take me to get there ?

goodness me ! what a choice ! i think i ll have a cappuccino please .
here you are . you are in the sugar .
new cars ? how much is a new apartment ?
yes it is very nice of you to say so . i can show you around and see the apartment .
i was born and raised in beijing .
do you have a lot of experience in the it ?
it 's a traditional chinese medicine . i can make it .
all right . would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?
not very often . making coffee is a bit troublesome . most of the time i just buy takeout at starbucks . and also i quite like instant coffee .
i think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . though its taste is not perfect it 's really cheap and convenient .
exactly . nescafe is the world 's favorite coffee . people love it all over the world ?
what a great idea !
yes . no doubt about that . for us coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . i heard chinese people do n't drink that much coffee .
no we do n't especially the old people . but more and more young people fall for coffee .
are n't they sure ?
yes . you can take the no . 36 bus from here but then you have to walk about 30 minutes .
i think this is the right bus .
what can i do for you ?
yes i am .
you see that means when anything is up for renewal we do it automatically and you do n't have to physically come here to sort it out . all you need to do is sign here and we 'll set it all up for you .
no i think it 's the best that i can get . i can see the bus quickly !

it 's about ten minutes walk .
oh no it s an extra 10 minutes drive .
no it s a monday . and i need to cash a check .
thank you for your help . a moment later oh this one is quite impressive . i 'll take it . by the way do you sell pearl earrings ?
yes we do . if you want i can send you a maid to my room .
no there are n't .
do you have a table for four please ?
ok i 'll take your time .

oh yes . i almost forgot ! can i also get some eye drops and um some condoms ?
well what do you think of a local one ?
that 's a good idea . i 'm already hungry .
i see . do you have your receipt ?
it 's a red wine .
how about a game of bridge ?
is n't this case yours ?
no it is n't . i 'm just looking for a new one .
what ?
it 's the right one .
but they are so silly ! how about the tour ?
it does n't matter . it happens to everyone .
yes i think so . i d like to have one medium steak and a bottle of wine .
and would you like to have a chicken ?
not very good . it s a bit too salty .
all right . there is one at the new concert hall .
i just want to have a coffee i think .
no we got no receipt and we pay it on the spot !
you see that means when anything is up for renewal we do it automatically and you do n't have to physically come here to sort it out . all you need to do is sign here and we 'll set it all up for you .
certainly sir . would you like it with us ?
i 'd like to have some more tourist attractions in the middle section .

yes . say you are really a good husband .
i see . you mean you did n't notice the whole city ?
of course .
well i ca n't agree with you .
are you crazy ? i have n't done anything like this .
yes i did . i found it very good .
yes but i like it .
how so ? he s never had a chance to grow on things .
please tell me the truth .
no i was n't . but it must be an allergy . i have to go to the park in the park .
it 's the colorado river .
i 'll give you a better turn around .
and there 's the extra charge and your insurance too .
no . you know it 's going to be the next one . i have n't seen you for a long time .
are you sure you are pale ?
it depends .
how about the results ?
the disease fails to respond to drugs .
thanks . how much should i pay ?

i 'm afraid i ca n't . my insurance is a little higher .
here you are .
how much is it ?
i will .
all right . there 's the the cash and your money is on the same street .
better take the subway . it 's faster and more convenient .
where do we pay the fares ?
we have a rather comprehensive subway system here . you can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy .
where do we pay the fare ?
you have to pay it on the meter .
oh i see . how can i get out of the platform after i get off the train ?
head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right .
can i go to the gym ?
yes . the trains is no . 14 .
this is the east market to central park bus . where do you want to go ?
to the <unk> government hall .
i m sure they will .
oh there comes the number seven miles so i think you can find a taxi .
yes i do .
ok . we will send a repairman to your room right now .
i understand .
it is n't that bad . we could use the subway to get some exercise .
it is twoyear and covers parts and service .
that is the best we can do .
i will be aware of that .
how long will it take to get a new carpet ?
sure . we have also got some special ties for our company .
is there anything else you would like ?
are you sure ?
yes we do .
i know and they are really nice too .
i ll have to get a couple in different colors .
me too .
i 'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the conference . i do n't think we should continue with the tv advertising .
good idea especially at this price .
the small one is ten yuan .
thanks . see you later .
no i 'm sorry sir . we do n't accept credit cards .
you see that means when anything is up for renewal we do it automatically and you do n't have to physically come here to sort it out . all you need to do is sign here and we 'll set it all up for you .
no i 'm not . this year i have to cut back on items .
the total amount is <unk> .
here is my member card . can you come back later ?
sorry sir . we do n't accept credit cards .
both rooms on the same card ?
can i have a ticket here ?
then i can buy a ticket here .
are there any other signs there ?
yes sir .
okay i 'll take it .
oh . i 'm sorry . there are no rooms available now .
alright .
no but i 'm not . i 've got to get a stomachache just fine .
are you going to have any coffee ?
i 'm not sure . i have n't decided yet . can you recommend something ?
i 'll have that too . i 'll take four pieces of that .
it 's nice . and it 's a little tight . do you have any suggestions ?
thank you !
we will do an investigation .
yes certainly .
yes . i 'd like to change some money please .
i see . well the problem is that all of the paperwork is signed by the end of the week . especially for those fragile commodities we 've got to be extra careful . otherwise if the things we consider giving you a lot of information we will be able to advance the product twice as soon as possible .
yes we do .
excuse me but can you bring me a copy of the ordinary ones ?
what can i do for you today ?
read me the index number !
of course i did . i ve been out of town several times .
yeah you can call the boss . what did you do ?
because it 's not easy .
you see that means when anything is up for renewal we do it automatically and you do n't have to physically come here to sort it out . all you need to do is sign here and we 'll set it all up for you .
that 's the sort of thing i think . it seems we 've got something wrong with it .
you ve got it . i m glad you re back . it was pretty gross .
yeah . why ?
have you made a decision ?
but i ca n't forget to do that .
oh all right . i ll try my best .
i understand . i thought you were not my best .
it was the best game ever .
you 're welcome . have a nice day .
i m looking for a bookcase . give me a hand i ve put in this box .
sure . the area is <unk> down . as you can see all the furniture is a sunny side of the strawberry house .
and about time too .
300 a month .
that s a good idea .
yes . it includes electricity water gas and cable but the telephone is extra .
will it possible for me to rent the apartment on a <unk> basis ?
the pipe is in my bathroom .
thanks .
well there are a lot of things . but as you know we do . for all those who have to keep a better atmosphere . but there s no room for that . it s a bit like a business so i don t mind .
well i have to pay the fee .
my boss gave me a big project . i had to have it finished by this morning . it was so difficult .
why not ? i think it s convenient to travel and the government would have to do so .
guess !
i think that is the entrance .
all right . we need is about it .
would you like a drink ?
that s a good idea .
great ! do you want a furnished house or a bedroom ?
no i d like to do that . it s easy to get a carpet carpet here .
oh my poor danny sure you are a man . but you know running like this in street is very dangerous .
do you mean that if there s a blackout ?
oh .
thanks . i am going to be late .
i 'm afraid i ca n't make it to the doctor .
well it depends .
yes .
where is my wallet ? someone has stolen my wallet !
i 'm very sorry . sir . i 'll ask the manager to take care of this .

you 're really lucky .
i invited all the colleagues in our department and also my former neighbor paul . he is a very good person . you should meet him .
it 's a good thing . we can do it well .

it 's saturday . you know . the girls are wearing my pants .
it 's just you !
he s some kind of sick .
i see . he 's so nice of you .
i 'm afraid not ! i 'm going to lay back to him .
that 's a good idea . he 'll make sure you buy him a good image .
why ?
about a year ago . she lives in an apartment on 3rd street across from the public library .
well i 'm sure she 'll love it .
because you can see the stars perfectly .
i do n't think so . she 's going to be all right .

well that 's very nice of you .
size 24 . are they synthetic or leather ?
they 're on special this week . they 've been reduced to five dollars .
the fitting rooms are over there . i think i 'll just try it on .
it looks great . just like you 're going to have a small celebration .
i 'll take this one .
yes . let me help you .
that 's a good idea . can you come back in a minute ?
it 's 100 cotton .
that 's good . can you give me a reduction ?
yes i just forgot where the bed <unk> department is .
what about this one ? it 's the latest design .
it 's pretty . can i try it on ?
of course . the fitting room is this way please .
ok . . . and here are your keys . i 'm just going to call you back later .
yeah . i went there on a couple of times .
here you are .
please come to my office at this time . you can come in and take care of the seat .
you know that i am a bit conservative .
that is a really great suggestion .
they 're my wife 's birthday and her birthday . we have a big variety of things to make up the summer .
and the ball is coming . you should put your hand in the ball .
no he used to be . but now he 's almost ready to play it .
sure . what should i do ?
is he breathing ?
i 'm sorry but he 's not in right now .
yes it 's a <unk> . well are you sure ?
it 's true sir .
there 's only one person left before the shopping center .
why are they all on the wall side of the palace ?
i have been washing clothes here since a few years ago .
i know . why do n't we go to the food there ?
what can i do for you ?
what 's the price ?
yes but it 's very expensive .
here you are .
the next bus will be here in four minutes .
you certainly do n't want to be long .
what can i do for you ?
no . the motor coach is airconditioned there is a galley for food preparation movies or music are available for your entertainment and attendants are there to take care of your every need .
i do n't want any of this one .
i do n't know . the ones who have a lot of gossip .
i liked it too . did you like it ?
yes but i think the same thing was n't too bad .
i think so .
my mom just wants everything to be perfect for us .
i 'm sorry . i 'll get it for you .
i think i 'm crazy about webtracker . i 'm not sleepy .
it 's very simple .
what a lovely dog ! how much do you think i 'll take ?
what about my siemens ?
we agreed to but they are very careful .
you said you were only going to window shop !
i heard she 's only 29 . 95 .
that 's what i thought . but what do we have to do to lose here ?
why do n't we go to a club ?
you 've got a point there . it is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit .
yes he was .
cool down harry ! what are you really mad about ? did you get ripped off ?
yes . last sunday i went to a nearby market . it was on <unk> fair . i chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot without even trying to strike a bargain . i paid one hundred and twenty . and just
is that so ? i 'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . it 's the norm of free trade . the seller sets
but do n't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?
of course that 's something really irritation . and the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . i recommend you to consult the price tags in the superb
that 's all right .
i know . i wo n't be late . i 'm really not going to wake up early .
yes we do . we do some eat as much as you can .
you see we are very busy with the trains .
no i have n't . i 'll go to sleep on two days later .
i go to bed at ten and get up at six .
that 's helpful for your health .
sure .
yes i am . i do n't like it very much .
really ? does that include a lot ?
i 'll have to write you a ticket and <unk> your vehicle .
ok . i 'll call you so we can set the table .
yes i d be glad to get rid of the bugs ! it would help me a lot .
ok . you 're going to have to go to a disco .
would you like to withdraw a lot ?
yes please tell her that band practice has been moved to tuesday night at eight thirty .
great . i ll call you later .
80 yuan .
here it is . here 's 200 yuan .
all right . i 'll give you the receipt and that 'll be the sixth of the clerk .
would you mind if i helped out in the kitchen instead ? i do enjoy cooking .
this is supposed to be your vacation we 'd like you to just relax .
you 're right .
ok well we 're going to make a pan of lasagne a salad and some garlic bread . here 's the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?
sure . we should probably preheat the oven right away too .
that 's a good idea . can you set the oven to 200 degrees celsius ?
that 's a bit high for lasagne . i 'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there .
fine . i 'll just get out the casserole dish the <unk> the salad bowl and the baking sheet .
you know i could do this myself . why do n't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ?
i do n't think it 's broken .
well if it 's not broken then you need to learn how to vacuum better because it does n't look like you 've vacuumed for ages !
fine . i 'll go vacuum . let me know if you need any other help .
yes . go straight on and turn right .
will you let me know where to get off ?
sure . d you like to know where the subway is ?
thank you .
no you need n't do that . it 's hard to get out of the hospital and take a rest .
thank you very much .
it 's a fortyfive minute to an hour ride .
i see . thank you .
you are welcome . i hope you 'll be more comfortable in your new room .
of course . is the dinner still on ?
yes i was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .
we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .
that 's what i thought you would do . listen i live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . it 's just down the street from all the bars . you probably do n't want to be walking around after dark .
it ca n't be that bad .
but it is ! take this morning for example . the subway was so packed this morning i got totally squished by about a hundred busy <unk> on the way to work .
really ? i never would have guessed . the criminals must only come out in the evenings because i 've never noticed anything strange when i 've been at your house in the daytime .
do me a favor and take a taxi . it 'd make me feel a lot better .
ok we will . how do you get around in the evenings ?
when i first moved in i walked everywhere . but within a week i had my purse stolen just a block away from the police station ! now i always take public transportation .
has anything else happened to you ?
nothing else has happened to me but i have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close .
well we 'll be careful . thanks for letting me know .
yes i know it . thank you very much .
are there many accidents in the city every day ?
but the most important thing is to be attractive .
what are your salary expectations ?
any rain ?
you re right . we will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey because we will be in builtup area .
you re welcome .
my roommate always brings a lot of friends . she 's always been pregnant for a week .
oh this is a real bargain . i 'm really glad you saw the advertisement .
yes i do . i get that sometimes . and i get a hold of nerves on my nerves .
what happened ?
a little but the police station was too small .
yes there was plenty of energy and plants .
of course !
i was n't worried about that . i do n't think i had any problems .
they 're not working i have to wear more than 100 yuan .
yes sir . what can i do for you ?
yes . where to ?
all right . here is your boarding pass and room key .
the chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . is that pretty good ?
i am sorry sir . we can t .
oh i see .
do n't worry the taxi is faster than the bus .
ok i 'll wait for you at once .
you know i hate shopping more than anything else in this world .
i know . but we could get some exercise in and we could get some errands run too . windowshopping won t cost you anything .
what kind of errands do we need to run ?
well we could go to the newsagent s to pick up the sunday paper go to the butcher s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner and to the chemist s to pick up your prescription from the doctor .
i 'll only go if we can stop at the <unk> to pick up something to drink for tonight .
ok . what about the band over there ? i had a drink held by the window . the music is n't bad .
sounds good . you have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . i know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms especially if the stores have special offers .
i promise . we re only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven t had time for .
ok let 's go then .
at the zoo wow ! this zoo is really huge .
for what ?
that comes to h . k . 120 yuan .
you said you were only going to window shop !
i agreed to not go into the mall but i can still look at things in the market !
i should have known . . .
it starts at 8
i 'm afraid we have to reschedule it for another six months .
it 's already 3 8 o 'clock .
this is not what i asked for i 'm afraid .
here you are .
no that 's all . thanks .
here you are . it 's <unk> .

here 's your change .
it 's on the service counter over there . please go to help yourself .

let 's go to the food stall . there 's a good one just around the corner .
i 'd love to try some snacks .

thank you .
well let 's try a size ten . he gets another pair and the customer tries a shoe on looks like a perfect fit .

i do n't know . . well i guess i 'll take them since you do n't seem to have anything better .
thank you ma 'am . it 's been a pleasure doing business with you .

thanks .
oh i m sorry . go ahead .
b please .
i ll be glad to hear that .
certainly . would you like to call the my name and phone number ?
<unk>
from code 513 4326748 .
i m calling about the advertisement for a flat with a bedroom .
um yes i 'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni olives and extra cheese .
<unk>
wait a minute please . i 'm barbara johnson . my phone number is <unk> .
he is coming but he is really busy . he often does n't know where we can do that .
well you can go to the supermarket for that . but you do n't have to lose weight .
i 'm on highway 175 going near exit 46 .
why would you like to work with us ?
it 's red .
i m sorry . we do n't haven any .
and the number would you like to have the bread ?
that 's fine .
are you going to go there for anything ?
yes mr . lee . and what can i do for you ?
hold on a second please . i 'll see if he 's in .
is my vcr ready ?
sure . it 's all my personal information .
thanks .
because i m not in the mood that s why .
well don t just sit there do something . come and help me in the kitchen .
help you in the kitchen i don t feel like it .
would you like to clear the table then ?
really ? do i have to do it ?
not if you don t want to .
really it 's so beautiful .
you can say that again .
you must n't pick it in this place .
where it is ?
it 's a private garden .
yes ?
where is it ?
why not ?
i have no idea where to get it from .
i really have n't heard of it .
it says no smoking .
sorry i 'm very near sighted .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do it again .
try to be more careful in future .
well i can t give it to you in that case there is no chance of meeting someone else .
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials ignite it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .
i am not surprised you eat too much .
and i suppose sitting at a desk all day at the office does n't help .
no i would n't think so .
i do wish i could lose weight .
well why do n't you go on the diet ?
i 've tried diets before but they 've never worked .
perhaps you should excercise more . why do n't you go to an exercise class .
yes maybe i should .
that is just an excuse . you can always find some time to exercise .
but i work hard all the time for long hours . often i have no time for lunch . yet i am still getting fatter .
bill you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . and skipping meals will not help you lose weight . in fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals .
i know you 're right but what can i do ?
how about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ?
but i 'll miss the news . it s important in my business to keep up with events in china .
i know i know . have you got a portable radio ? you can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time .
that 's a good idea !
my favorite . what 's the difference between a regular fruit and a black one ?
oh i 'm so sorry . can i get you another one ? i have to stay a little late .
i am glad you like it ! my wife is so touched .
go and look at the table .
there you go .
okay i 'll have them brought to you immediately .
sure .
ok . . . and here are your keys . i 'm just going to call you back later .
well i swim and run every day .
now tell me what do you eat ?
well i do n't eat any meat but i do eat fish and eggs .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
oh yes and fruit i love fruit .
what do you drink ?
well i never drink alcohol coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
what do you drink ?
you too . have you lost some weight ?
yes i took off 4 kilos . i am glad you notice it .
not some crazy diet fat i hope .
no no i just changed my eating habits . i eat a balance meal . and i eat less than before .
sounds reasonable . what do you think about the quality of your salary ?
ah yes that 's right .
ah yes that 's too bad .
ah this is david .
oh i m sorry ms . murphy . i ll arrange the lunch for you .
why not ?
no thanks . i 've had enough .
actually you have n't had much .
to tell you the truth i am on the diet .
that sounds ridiculous . why ?
well i am gaining weight these days and i have to watch my calories .
no do n't try to tend me . i 'm becoming chubby and i have to slender down .
you know . i 've been sports for the last few years . how do you feel about the pay ?
i do n't think so . i know i 've put on weight this winter .
so you are watching your weight are n't you ?
yes to tell you the truth . i am on the diet .
where are you heading now ?
i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road . it is very close to your house .
is that the university next to the teachers college ?
that 's the one .
what size ?
yeah . if we share the cab it 'll be cheaper . besides that your chinese is better than mine . the drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though i practice my pronunciation carefully .
well . don t worry about it i will be happy to share the taxi with you .
it 's a private garden .
are you in a hurry ?
no i 'm not .
ok sir . a table for 6 at 8 00 this evening . is that okay ?
there 's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
i 'll do my best .
that 's great .
here 's your change . please wait a moment .
no . if you ca n't break it keep the change . but can you give me a receipt ?
here is your receipt . thank you .
yes they all stop at this corner .
i want to go to broadway and 82nd street . can i take any bus that comes along ?
you can take any bus except the number 9 .
how often do the buses run ?
they run about every five minutes .
fine . how long does it take to get to 82nd street ?
about fifteen minutes . it 's not far . are you a stranger in new york ?
yes i am . i arrived only three days ago from japan .
how do you like new york city ?
i like it very much but it 's a little confusing to me .
you 'll soon get accustomed to it . it 's not difficult . well here 's the bus . fortunately it 's not full .
thank you for the information .
do n't mention it .
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
i saw her yesterday . she was a little better .
must i catch a number 7 bus to get there ?
no you need n't . a number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital .
number 13 buses run much more frequently do n't they ?

what ? really ? i don t really want to have to buy a new phone .
well you re in luck ! you see if you sign up for our threeyear plan we ll throw in a handset for free .

well you get nine hundred anytime minutes and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other <unk> clients one thousand text messages per month and weekend . oh and we also offer a rollover option .
wow all this for forty dollars per month ?
that s right plus the activation fee the emergency services fee the monthly service fee oh and any charges for extra minutes and . .
sure . it 's 510 pm .
and a company car .
well i guess i d be more careful about taking a bus .
she s my wife s tenyearold niece . i guess there won t be another wedding in the house .
yeah it is the new president . look at the general line of the line .
what 's up ? honey !
hmm . i am sorry to hear that . please watch the tv .
oh i am sorry . i forgot to close the door . i had no idea we 'd be able to fall asleep .
yes ! thank you for calling . thank you for calling .
what sort of <unk> are we dealing with ?
just this ? we have been living here for years .
well there s nothing we can t handle . i ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches but the termites will be harder to get rid of . we will have to cover the entire house and <unk> it . unfortunately that means you will have to stay for the next three days .
no problem just get rid of the bugs !
morning michael . i ve been very busy lately . one of our other vendors is going out of business and i ve been searching for a suitable replacement .
well rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run please sit down . coffee ?
no this is my first . i was n't thinking of inviting you . but i was n't thinking of a movie .
haha i could never do that . i d be a zombie if i didn t have my morning coffee fix . let s get down to business then .
yes . i ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . the demand for phone cameras is growing and pear has been falling behind in the market .
that s great ! i m glad to hear that pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . is pear still interested in having those ?
no we re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . we were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
surely . let s get started by drafting a new contract .
sure what kind of shoe are you looking for ? we ve got <unk> sandals sleek high heels edgy pumps or if you re looking for something a little more practical we ve got mary janes ballerinas .
show me some classic high heels please .
ok right this way . what color did you have in mind ?
black .
of course . we ve got this style here that is very popular . because it s an opentoe shoe you can wear it any time of the year . they look great on everyone .
umm . too shiny . and i wear pantyhose with my shoes so let s look for a <unk> shoe .
ok these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a twoinch heel so they are very comfortable .
i don t like the pointed toes . let me take a look at what else you have . too high . that one looks like the back would cut into my heel . i have a high instep so i doubt that one will fit properly . i don t want bows . i find <unk> very uncomfortable . those might as well be stilettos . ah finally this is what i m looking for .
don t worry . i ll get it . i ll show you how .
size 38 or 39 .
ok you will be hearing from mr wood later in the afternoon then mr john .
hmmm . not good . they re too tight . the length is right but the shoe is too narrow and it s pinching my toes . and there d be no room for my <unk> . you know what ? i don t think i have the patience for this today . i don t make shoes like they used to . i ll come back another time .
have a nice day ma am .
why not ? come on ! just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
i will ! i ll feed it bathe it and walk it every day ! we can get a <unk> or a german <unk> !
what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus our apartment is too small for that <unk> of dog .
ok . how about we get a cat or a <unk> ?
we re planning on having children soon i don t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
fine ! let s get a bird then ! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! a parrot would be awesome !
i ll tell you what i can get you some hamsters and we ll take it from there .
<unk> !
well since we are getting up so late i decided to make a big breakfast !
nice ! brunch !
kind of so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
wow ! you really went all out ! did you make any coffee ?
yeah just the way you like it ! i also put out some cereal and <unk> if you feel like having something more light .
looks good . i ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
get the jam and butter while you are in there ! oh ! and don t forget the syrup !
what ? you don t know the first thing about gardening !
on the contrary i have been reading a lot of books about the subject .

well first i need to buy some things such as fertilizer seeds and tools .
what type of tools ?
you know the basics . a rake shovel spade and a hoe .
right . well it seems like you have all your bases covered . what s next ?
i ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . i ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! gardening all done !
well good luck with your garden especially considering we are in the dry season and it won t rain for the next three months !

i wish i could but i have to walk the dog and finish cooking so if you would excuse me .

i am the apartment manager . what can i do for you ?
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
really ? how much do you want to pay ?
what is it ?
do you have any experience in this field ?
i 'm afraid there 's no room for any moment .
thank you .
no problem . i know where to go .
do n't mention it . it is my duty .
i 'm finished . here 's the form and my old card .
we will have to check your room . as soon as you bring it back to us .
i have to wear the new carpet .
you think it s going to be so expensive .
well sometimes the apartment can be fixed .
yes it has great curb appeal .
the complaint rate for our new product line is very high almost eight percent .
i will blow my nose and nose will start working .
how much will it cost ?
i will .
well my saddle is too low for me . do you have any suggestions ?
yes it has great news .
you do ? my dad gave me a big one .
i like it but there is one problem .
you are not english are you ?
i bought some special television at an apartment . it hasn t been on my way to deal with a new computer .
please call if you have any other requests . your food will be delivered promptly .
it s beautiful .
i 'm ok . i will blow my nose later .
i will .
where s your polling place ?
the complaint rate for our new product line is very high almost eight percent of the day .
what happened ?
you are miss liu ?
ok .
what took so long ? i thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago !
i d like to get some details about a personal housing loan please .
i 'm sorry . all the news is full today .
well . i hope to reschedule it .
i don t know . the thing is that all you need is just don t know how to take the water with you .
i d be glad to .
when are you available ?
that would be great .
all right see you then .
what else will you be needing ?
i like it but i do n't think it s very nice .
oh you 're going to find an apartment in the ads ?
yes please .
what is it ?
when i asked how people were going to dress dr . <unk> said it was casual .
i m ok . i will go and buy them .
how much will the house cost ?
you should check the connections .
the car park in a bit expensive !
yes it has great news .
i agree . i ll be very happy to hear it .
i m happy to hear that .
what are your plans now that you re getting out ?
the rent is 725 each month .
that s way too much .
i can t afford that .
not much . i know it 's going to be a very expensive broken price .
can i pay by card ?
but i m not sure if we ll get stuck in traffic jam .
what are you going to do ?
that s fine .
what would you have for a la cane ?
i will explain it in a few days .
i had a home inspection before but didn t really understand it .
can you tell me the advantages of a home inspection ?
we will be more careful if we can afford a room by taxi .
the owners might not be aware of everything wrong with the house . some things are hidden but might still be a problem for you .
i can predict it will be the way .
the owners might not be aware of everything wrong with the house . some things are hidden but you can try to find the problem for the inspection .
that 's a cool idea .
i found it a very long house . a lot of things are on the tenth of the screen . there was a very nice view from the elevator . i can t believe it was on the floor .
a month would be quite convenient . there are many people waiting for you to call .
will you also take your christmas cards and some will be the nearest to you ?
make sure that you transfer the utilities to your name and tell them when you will be moving in .
i really like the job though . the best i ve had was in is to go ahead and make the transfer of my longterm plans . then i do n't want to go shopping with my relevant department .
if you could give me a few more reduction we would be willing to give you a discount .
i want a new appliances .
that 's good . we have many fresh clothes in the house . i can assure you this new one will take care of it .
so what 's the rent ?
that 's no problem . what are you going to have for that day ?
yes . which one is the brake again ?
the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas .
i m glad this car is an automatic . i do n't like having to change gears .
automatics are very simple to drive . the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver s seat !
very funny . next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . can you see out of them ?
i can t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . could you move it forward a bit please ?
how s that ?
that s very good .
check your petrol situation .
the tank is almost empty . i guess i ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up .
that s a good idea . put your keys in the ignition start it up put the car in reserve wait for the road to be clear and then back out of the <unk> .
i got it . don t worry . i ll get you there in one piece .
remember no honking this time . the horn is only for emergencies !
why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ?
i 'm not quitting yet . you know my favourite slogan do n't you ?
yeah i know . i know . but you 're really hot .
right !
i 'm getting a little short on cash . let 's just window shop a little .
ok .
this is your registration card . please don t lose it and bring it whenever you come .
ahahah and i thought you were tired .
you know . . i have a weakness for long dresses .
it sure looks special looks expensive too .
sure does . hey can i sponge a little cash of you ?
do n't worry mary i 've got you covered .
thanks jeanine you are a real pal . let 's go in .
eyes you sent them to new york right ?
that 's right . i thought i 'd come back to buy a few more souvenirs .
what did you have in mind ?
i do n't know yet .
we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . the same designs can be found on these posters .
posters are difficult to travel with . i think i 'll just buy the postcards . i heard that you might also have some of the <unk> that are made in venice .
yes we do . they 're on the wall behind you .
how much do they cost ?
not much at all . i think it 's about 100 dollars .
yes i think i 'd like the green mask in the middle .
here you go .
would you like any cash back ?
are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift ?
yes it 's the same size .
we 've got plenty to choose from here .
they look delicious . i think she 'll be pleased .
it 's a good idea .
i see . you 've already got the money .
i don t know what happened to me . i just lost it .
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
wow ! you could go to the louvre agent for have a picnic and i never learned a lot .
yes .
that 's because you cheated .
martha i could just do that to get sara 's responsibility and sara can talk to her in the meeting .
so let 's see . yes some of the buildings are on the list of place right . i was wondering if it was ok .
do you really enjoy such dangerous sports ?
you can say that again . the weather here is much better than the last few days .
well since you 're in love maybe you should come to a real estate agent .
yes please . i have a try .
me ? i ca n't believe he . how does he like this ?
not really .
ok . i 'll go too .
do you know where dawanglu is ?
sorry but he 's busy then too .
no and they said they are not .
great . i 'm sorry but i really can t .
i see . thanks .
well i really like your made such great <unk> .
i 'll let you know when we get there .
ok . let 's go .
have you heard anything about it ?
i 'm on a diet .
what 's so great about it ?
it 's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances .
not to me i would n't be caught dead in that .
i love that kind of stuff .
yeah you seem to like those styles .
sure do . i get a kick out of looking <unk> .
this one looks really expensive though .
i do n't care how much it costs . i 'm rolling in it .
lucky you ! i ca n't buy anything else . i 'm flat broke .
i got a replace my party outfit i trashed it last week .
why did you drag me into this ? i 've spent a week salary .
are you on the level ? you 're the one who called me remember ?
just joking t . i 've got it somewhere . let 's go and have a close look at your outfit .
you can buy the bubble wrap here but you ll have to stand in line over here to post your package .
sounds a very long time .
it takes about 3 minutes per person so it ll probably be about an hour s wait .
can i buy stamps here ?
sure . how many would you like ?
i 'll take two more a red one and a white one .
are you sending them abroad ?
no i am on business .
do you have any going anywhere in the eu ? if you do those are less expensive .
no .
i 'll have to write you a ticket and <unk> your vehicle .
and the bubble wrap ?
that s another quid .
thanks a lot . you ve been very helpful .
i want to sign up for some funds units . how do i go about it ?
no problem . what kind of novel do you want to get ?
she usually does n't wear anything but a few drops of chanel no . 5 . but i 'd like to buy her a new fragrance .
ok here are some of our most popular perfumes .
which one would you recommend ?
well since it 's summer and i had looked that you had quite a bit sun i 'll recommend our summer special it 's specially suited for individuals with sensitive skin .
that smells great . i 'll take one bottle please .
would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
it 's ok . she normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder and i do n't know what shade to buy .
how about some lipstick ? every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick .
she does n't usually wear lipstick . she thinks it makes her nose look too big .
how about some mascara ? that will make her eyes look bigger .
no thank you . she has big enough eyes as it is .
i know what she would likesome whitening cream .
no thanks . western women usually try to make their skin darker not lighter .
will that be all then ?
that will be all . you 've been very helpful thanks .
yeah i 'm glad that we did n't have to wait long . i 'm starving !
let 's take a look at the menu so we can order . do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?
what would you rather have samosas or poppadoms ?
i heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .
well let 's get a plate of those then .
sounds good . what are you going to have for your main course ?
i think i might have a dahl .
what 's in a dahl ?
it 's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .
that sounds nice . do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
ok . how about some lamb kebabs ?
that 's my favourite . do you want to have some wine or beer ?
i think i 'll have a beer .
ok shall i flag down the waitress ?
i would n't recommend it . i think we should wait until she comes round .
you 're right . that might seem a bit rude . it 's a good thing i 've got you with me !
what would you do without me ?
what size are you looking for ?
i wear size 40 .
i love this wine ! it goes very well with the chicken .
i 'll just look at the list . what do you think ?
good . come to our office tomorrow afternoon .
yeah i think so . but it 's difficult to find vegetarian one .
the same question . how do you like the brown one ?
i think so . i think it 's something that i 've got on sale too . how much is the old and how can i get ?
i agree . people will love you so much .
i prefer the indoor sports page . let me see . . . oh the fragrance of plum blossoms you can always get the ball into the cup of coffee .

i 'm glad you are enjoying your new job .
stop being such a baby . the never goes to the hospital in the subway station .
how about your mother ?
i 'd hate for being there if i had n't moved in .
let me tell you the story . in 1892 patty smith hill and mildred hill wrote a song called good morning to you . but later someone added the words happy birthday to their tune .
i 've probably gone to the bookstore .
exactly .
yes i have been thinking about it for a while . now i finally make up my mind to leave . i have given my resignation letter to our boss last friday .
actually we could get together again .
well you can t tell me which bus should i take ?
i really like that outfit .
can i have my 200 please ?
how about your academic records at college ?
it 's not far away then . let 's walk it 's beginning to rain .
it only takes 45 minutes to an hour .
where to meet ?
three blocks down the road .
it 's really nice .
yeah . every bus has half to new york .
how much does it cost ?
it is . our customers really like it . do you have any other questions about your new accounts ?
no i do n't .
yes i do .
you can catch the <unk> .
sorry sir .
that 'll be 25 cents .
well i guess you 're right .
i 'll give you a call once a week .
well you can catch the <unk> .
i 've been to london for a year .
can you just tell me ?
no problem .
yeah i really like that outfit .
would you like to pay for it with a try ?
you would n't say that .
do you let me know where to get off ?
it 's about fortyfive minutes to an hour .
i 'll wait .
the head office .
it 's really nice .
that 's right . the only thing i can afford is to buy some souvenirs .
oh yeah . i know it 's not new here .
will you be able to make it ?
the four stop is the corner of the fifth avenue .
yes it 's still early .
is this bus a crowded bus ?
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
it should be the best time .
what ?
i honestly did n't know .
i sure did .
and not expensive either .
you could try .
i 'm sorry . i do n't know whether i can teach you .
yeah you just have to pay the fare to new york city .
well i guess you 're right .
i am not certain about that .
it 's not far away then . let 's walk it 's beginning to rain .
it should take about 20 minutes to an hour .
it 's not far away then . let 's walk it 's beginning to rain .
you have to get off at the hospital and then change trains for bus 15 .
cindy did n't mention it .
yeah . the mall has a very catalogue for our introduction .
oh i know it .
okay so friday at what time ?
where do i go to pick up my ballot ?
were you looking at a particular refrigerator ?
yes . how much is it ?
this particular refrigerator is a very nice choice .
i have chosen january as the month for this retreat .
it 's a job at an advertisement company .
yes it is .
the tv station will air the world cup football match alive at 8 30 .
may i see the inside for myself ?
come on .
what a beautiful lake ! the green tea house is so beautiful .
you came to the right place . any particular decade ?
if you had a box made in the 20s that would be nice .
we just got one in yesterday so now we have six .
would any of them have dancing figures ?
yes we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures .
oh they 're both so beautiful . let me have this one i think .
that one truly is a beautiful piece of work is n't it ?
one last question
oh no . everything we sell here is as is .
i guess i was asking for too much .
if it breaks down maybe you can find a repairman on the internet .
i would like to buy a new fridge .
is there one in particular that you like ?
i was looking at this kenmore refrigerator .
this particular refrigerator is a very good choice .
what 's so great about it ?
it 's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances .
what appliances ?
it comes with an ice maker water dispenser and there is a lot of room inside .
may i see the inside for myself ?
be my guest .
wow ! you 're right ! this refrigerator is great . i 'll take it .
do you know how many you need ?
i think i can get by with 2000 .
we can get started as soon as you fill out this form .
i hope you can make the new cards just like my old cards .
you wo n't be able to tell the difference with a magnifying glass .
. . . okay i 'm through . here 's the form and my old card .
very good . your order will be ready in one week .
now that i think of it three days is better than seven .
we can do that but you 'll have to pay a little extra .
oh hello tom ! beautiful day isn t it ?
you seem to be in a hurry .
i think i should go to the movies .
this is your registration card . please don t lose it and bring it whenever you come .
what do you think of the food here ?
yeah . they 're usually this big .
so what are you going to do now ?
that s all right .
thank you .
no you can use the gym . you can go to the gym to make your own lunch break .
i 'm not sure which one is better ?
hey sounds great . i 'll take the escalator .
do you have any idea where we are ?
how often do you run to the bus ?
it depends . do you want to send it via priority express or standard mail ?
i want to come back to my aunt .
no . the bus will leave about 20 minutes .
the most important thing is that i want to be on the 2nd of december . i feel as soon as i do .
most of them are office buildings huge department stores and hotels but some are just private homes . new york is one of the financial centers of the words so there are lots of very expensive places .
do you have any idea of what courses you like ?
ok . and keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over you 'll only have to cook that side lightly . put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the
is that right ?
yes it was wonderful but i ca n't wait to come in and see you .
but i still miss them . and how are the buses ?
no i am lin .
you see that means when anything is up for renewal we do it automatically and you do n't have to physically come here to sort it out . all you need to do is sign here and we 'll set it all up for you .
i see . he always brings me the class .
why do n't you sit in the back with me ?
the new account is i i want to take care of this .
the bank .
let 's make a bet .
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .

he 's got a passport and a visa .
maybe i can make time for me .
honey if you do n't think that we are a lot of homework .
where does he go to school ?
all right .
i 'll have to write you a ticket and <unk> your vehicle .
yes he does . he s very good at the university .
have you got the scholarship or is it your first semester ?
um i m just having a look around . it s my girlfriend s birthday tomorrow . i 'm trying to find her something .
he is the boy i 've read a lot of books about him .

what 's your favorite computer ?
it 's a room with a bath .
here we are . you 're all set . i 'll take care of it .
thank you .
what 's your name please ?
what 's wrong ?
do n't worry . i 've got plenty of time .
working .
no i would n't do that . i think we 'll have to stay in the united states for long .
sure . here is your boarding pass .
i had to carry my backpack with me all day .
when my friend gets the gun from the doctor 's office he had an accident and was taken to hospital .
what 's the matter ?
ok . i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
this is a membership card . we can send you a photograph to your mother 's account .
no you can give me a map .
you 're welcome .

without traffic it takes about an hour .
great . i don t think i have a problem with it .
no . she s in a meeting with a client .
i want to sign up for some funds units . how do i go about it ?
don t worry about that . it s probably of the stress you ve been under . just take some aspirin . combined with the stronger cough medicine it will make you feel very tired . you shouldn t work or use any equipment which requires concentration . if i were you i d just sleep read a book or watch tv
i hope so .
this is your registration card . please don t lose it and bring it whenever you come .
is it serious ?
are you sure that this has nothing to do with sleep ?
i would like to transfer some money .
these books over here are about ancient history . they might be helpful .
can i check this one out ?
i m sorry . it s for reference only so it must stay in the library . but you re welcome to look through it .
ok . and here s my card . you can check out these books out .
all right . they re due back next wednesday .
thanks for your help .
not bad . it s a bit difficult to find a place to work .
fantastic ! i went to the wedding in august !
yes i know . but you 're a little worried .
no i 'm not feeling well . i just want to get some .
is it a through one ?
very good thank you . i 'm getting hungry now .
what are you going to do ?
i think it 's going to be enough for the monthly sticker .
we have a package tour there . it is a general tour of the cities .
fine .
oh no . i ca n't have failed .
what will you do if you have any questions ?
i think i will make a thorough analysis of this job .
i do n't know . i 've got to go to the university of tampa to do a scholarship so i 'll do it at the end of the month .
i am an engineer at the university .
are there any other jobs in your parents ?
oh i know what you mean . i m not happy at the moment . it s just hard to get used to chinese new york .
but all these people say nothing about them .
well these things are for example taken off to get correct amount .
are there many different cities in the world ?
that 's a good idea . it is a company that does n't mean we have a problem with the company .
yes i think you are right .
and not expensive either .
oh i learned that myself .
it was founded in 2002 has been in business for 10 years .
oh i learned that he is also a legendary violinist .
well there are lots of things . first of of are there small sales department . we are going to make sure that you are on the right side .
so the land of september and china are being used to be called wild countries .
well i guess so . however it 's too hard to say anything about your family . you should try to understand what they say .
really ? is it your parking in all ?
that 's because you see the stars in heaven .
that 's right . i thought the whole week was just for the new product . it was n't very easy .
if you d like to .
of course .
it was there a couple of days ago . you should come from it as you are in 7 days .
you had a very pleasant voice .
exactly . with the different smell of the spring and classical music there 's also a special dance of plum blossoms .
i see .
all right . you know november is the most important thing .
all right . we 'll be able to join them .
making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . you need to learn how to do the research and skills .
so if i m interested in the position i m impressed with the language .
yeah it is . i ve got to learn some skills .
you know how ? i was thinking of going to school for more than one week .
did you get a good job ?
no i do n't think so .
how about the new bar across road ?
my favorite subjects was n't all that impressed .
you are a quick learner .
no but i could n't .
you should have a try .
i 'm sorry . you must have dialed the wrong number . there is no petti here .
hold on a minute please . i 'll call him back later .
some of my friends shop at a hospital are n't they ?
he would be involved in another company .
we rappelled down the side of a 300 foot cliff . it 's very exciting .
well in that case you have to go to the police station first .
where does he live now ?
well it 's the best way to get to the movies from the university .
you know that i should n't go to the bank to the bank to withdraw my money .
when will i know your decision ?
i was just thinking about getting a bite to see a movie . have you been ?
i guess you 're right . maybe it 's how you plan to quit .
i guess i 'm very tired .
you must take a long time . the ball is going ahead .
so you can keep the music down ?
it 's already 3 days monday .
well i am sorry to hear that . you can go to the class to work on it .
i 'm going to the bank at the time of china .
what about dad ?
i 'm going to help him .
ok . i 'll let you know if i can .
i see . well another problem is your bill .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country but people don t seem to keen to pay for their tv programs . besides the <unk> channels offer a good range of programs .
you are right . i am also wondering about the pay .
very well . i have your contract ready for the next few days .
well speaking of history i guess you are a good student . we have n't had a job in that field .
well i was also interested in doing something else on the internet .
yeah it will be a long tour . i ca n't wait to see it .
yes that 's the best part . today we do all have a basic physical examination and what do you think about the sports events ?
you might be a good accountant .
nice to meet you lvan . my name is alike . i 'm from japan .
i 'm glad to meet you too .
a second language is always difficult .
true but english is harder than most . it s a crazy language .
a crazy language ? why do you say that ?
one letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .
no wonder you say english is a crazy language .
oh i m really good . i m working in a bit of a team player .
yes . we should have a party there .
i took a lot of time off .
i did n't know you had any experience in college .
to be honest i like all of them except for the math teacher . though he must be quite young he seems like an old person . he 's so boring .
i know you like him too . they made the best decision to play . i m so jealous . i hope you can do something like he .
oh excellent . i m proficient in both written and spoken english .
i feel the same way . the professional problem is that it 's so helpful for her to be able to handle english .
she 's in the hospital with my dad . i have to go back tonight .
and she was a very good student .
no . the first time i noticed was trying to lower the cost of yourself .
you know how to be . she s very helpful and helpful in her class .
no . she s very old .
that 's great .
well we use the exhaust gases from our printing <unk> to provide energy to heat our dryers .
what is that ? what are you doing ! you re taking all this caviar ! that caviar is a <unk> ?
thanks . and i appreciate that .
i hear we 'll have a new english teacher this semester .
no . she asked me to go to the concert tonight .
how about a game of bridge ?
i did n't really but i always liked it .
that 's right .
she has pretty light brown eyes .
did you know that she was a psycho man .
i learned to be patient professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .
no but i was thinking of her .
no that 's all . it seems like a plan to cut into my account .
i know . but you know sometimes i ca n't help it . i 'm going to quit my job and pay for it .
no i have n't .
you know why people wouldn t just answer a few words in advance . some time i have to keep and understand how to use the internet .
but that 's really bad . it could be a great pleasure to have you with us .
well it s a long way to find out your face . we ll be very happy to see it .
no . as long as you don t mind it s a family thing or two dogs . but you should have a try .
the thing i want to try .
she is a <unk> .
how many languages can you speak in addition to her mother tongue ?
no . i thought i d be interested in them .
what kind of girl is she ?
this one is very nice . it s very expensive and has a lot of classic music .
you ca n't help learning when you 're using it all day . you ll see . a few weeks study in the school will have a similar effect on you .
i hope so . you see at the moment i find it difficult to get used to the teacher 's speed and accent . i 'm awfully worried i ca n't reply as quickly as she seems to expect .
oh she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use english throughout the class . she does n't mind your making mistakes though .
you know speaking in class is a very good chance to put your english to practical use .
that 's the new teacher .
what do you think of the teacher ?
she 's very nice .
what does she teach ?
english of course .
is she your teacher ?
yes . she teaches our class three times a week .
can she speak chinese to her students ?
not very much .
it 's a good thing you can speak english !
yes i finished last friday .
you sound relieved .
well yes . i do n't mind admitting that i am . i enjoyed school but i did object to having to go in every day once we 've done all our exams .
well what are you going to do now ? have you made any plans ?
yes i intend to go to university . that ll be in september . but it all depends on my a level results .
what are you going to do if you have a family ?
oh yes .
five days a week too ?
actually five and a half . on saturday we have classes only in the morning .
gosh !
that 's too much for us really .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to the railway station .
when do you start school ?
i 'm going to register right now .
that 's good .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
she 's very nice .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
to be honest i have to use chopsticks .
i think the software of computer is well worth learning .
most of them only speak spanish . but some people do n't even live in them .
what are the fundamental course ?
oh i think most of the students in america are quite different from private school .
what are the fundamental course ?
not really .
i do n't think so .
i don t have one . i m sure you could . i prefer to buy a new one . it s easy to use .
there are hundreds and hundreds . english is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions .
can you give us an example ?
i 'll look up the rate . to look up does n't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . it means to search for and find some information .
what about the expression goodbye ? is that an idiom ?
that is just a natural grammatical english expression . it has a direct translation in other languages .
this is interesting ms . parker .
i want to sign up for some funds units . how do i go about it ?
anything else ?
yes i have it .
how much is it ?
i 'll do it right now .
and not expensive either .
what if i can t meet that requirement ?
you owe 24 . 50 .
how much do i owe ?
what are you going to do ?
all right . i ll give it back to you in a minute .
i need to withdraw some money .
is that all you need ?
i have it right here .
you can use it for eleven hundred dollars .
i got the address and telephone number .
ok it 's a date then !
then what do i do ?
would you like cash back ?
that s it ?
would you like any cash back ?
thank you very much .
well i 'm looking for a job .
you will need to apply for one .
i d like to do that .
you can come in this afternoon . if you would feel better bring your husband with you .
i d like to do that .
ok it 's a date then !
i see .
all that 's left is to cook it .
here you are .
we ll have to freeze payment on those charges until the investigation is finished .
thank you . i will get my passport and picture back .
do you need a spot here or off campus ?
i have both but i usually use my car to get to school .
but today is beautiful .
i do n't know what the best part is .

be careful about the time limits on the streets . have you seen the signs for time limits ?
no i have not seen the signs .
pay attention to what the signs tell you in terms of time limits and what days you can park there . do you know what the curb colors mean ?
maybe you can take a few minutes to get the receipts out .
just remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means loading and unloading only . i think you 'll be good to go !

do you feel very comfortable with the windows and paint ?
what a great idea !
i really do n't think it will . i think it is great . i appreciate all the help .
what 's the problem ?
certainly . first you need to know what your background you are interested in . have you read it ?
we are all happy to do so .
do we get a day off from school then ?
oh no . i 'm just in the mood for it .
why do n't you try this one ? it 's on the second floor .
well there are so many places . many of southern china are good at all . you can do that shopping with people over the internet .
will you tell me what you need to do next ?
of course . you can be more careful about it .
you could try this kind of carpet . it is very cheap .
yes i want to book a room .
i m sorry . it s for reference only so it must stay in the library . but you might have to read it yourself .
yes i know . it s going to be the next minute .
all you need is your driver 's license .
i d like to do that .
thank you .
do you want me to sent it out with me ?

i would like to transfer some money .
is that all you need ?
all right . thanks .
would you like any cash back ?
good . have you finished school ?
you do realize you are going to have to pay late fees right ?
i don t have to pay right now .
as a matter of fact you will be fined .
so i have to pay 25 cents for each day the books are late ?
you have to pay the excess luggage charge please .
that s what i was thinking .
i want to sign up for some funds units . how do i go about it ?
give them here .
i think someone is stalking me .
that 's a long time .
i can t give it to you if i ll get it fixed .
it does n't matter . the company will lend you a few dollars .
that s all right .
i wish i could stay a little longer .
i feel terrible i can t stand it .
would you like any cash back ?
what can i help you with ?
i would like to transfer some money .

i understand .
i 'll buy it for 2000 .
i see . thank you .
may be some other time .
you can t think of anything ?
that s a lot .
not at all . i 'd like to start with the warm water in .
well i 'm looking for a job .
anything else ?
i got it from an international computer company .
it 's not like your house . the price of course is pretty high . and it 's got a 90 minute from your house .
i understand . it was n't as simple as i thought .
nothing . the landlord pays .

i ll take this one .
i m glad to hear that .

you should check the local paper in the next room .
he came back from america and tried to get a raise .
it s right . i will see you after school .
give me a list of what you need to get .
come on .
how do you log on to the computer ?
that s right . we have an interview in our company .
i feel dizzy .
let me see . it 's a little cheaper . you can have a try .
the lecturer is dull too .
i feel he 's like a talking machine .
i feel the same way .
well in that case i guess . maybe i can go to the beach together .
right that makes sense .
why ?
and please help me type the <unk> .
come on .
is this your first time ?
i will ask him .
i bet he is . he s a very talented person . i m sure he will win a lot of money .
what 's your date of birth ?
ok . see you later .
he does n't treat you that . it 's a good thing .
i 'm still sorry . i 'll call you later .
what is the climate like in your country ?
he must be really allergic to pollen . my niece is allergic to pollen . it seems like she has a bad cold but in fact it s her allergy .
not really . he is great and honest .
oh i know . he is a chicken guy .
yes i did . and you know him the white smoke and i m so nervous .
oh i see . i 'm sure you will like it .
thank you . my wife will be very happy to see him .
he was a fireman in the village . when he was a child .
yes you are right .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
you mean the matter with her ? she was n't very good at it .
i 've been away on vacation . how is everything ?
i ll bet you were hungry then .
i 've got a headache and a cough .
i know what you mean . i could n't understand why you 're so rude .
i am not !
no i 'm not . i 'm just browsing . thanks .
ok i will .
no problem .
thank you . good luck .
bob i m just a singer .
that 's quite a compliment coming from you .
i 've never seen such a sale before . it is called the prices of good quality .
and what is it regarding please ?
thank you . it is a total of red wood .
i honestly think it looks great .
fine . well how much should i pay ?
i ca n't believe it .
but it 's on the 1st street .
yes i do . it s very interesting . what s your job ?
look ! he has a leather belt .
that 's okay . i think you 'd better get a further reduction .
no i do n't would n't !
hello there are a lot of business !
i can tell you from experience that actually .
a lot of people compare you to julia roberts .
yeah they are .
thank you .
it 's just your size .
i 'm glad you like it .
yes it is . it was on sale for only 35 dollars .
thank you .
you 're welcome . and i wish you every success in your new venture .
thank you .
you have a real talent ellen !
you are a good teacher .
thanks jane . i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
but the bank should not be closed so we should n't to get any money .
i 'm flying home on sunday afternoon .
do you have any order forms here so that i can get a subscription to the magazine ?
thank you very much .
really ? how long will you be staying there ?
you know . i took part in the chinese contest . i was the best and they gave me this reward . i don t have to pay for my trip .
what was it ?
oh i actually took a wrong turn . everything is so good .
oh yes . is there anything you want to do besides watching it ?
i feel like sitting down and having a really bad headache .
sure . i 'm really sorry about that .
thank you for saying so . i have been trying to make it .
yes she is . she is a science fiction writer .
what did you do ?
i am completely serious .
i certainly do . you know the words . but i 'm a little nervous about it .
you know what ? but you 're welcome .
you 're welcome .
so i have no intention of energy .
why ? i do n't think so .
i m glad you like it .
you can never be serious ! the never loses . i m not an exception to the world .
he 's really pushed me too far . do n't worry .
call the police . i have talked to him about and let 's call his place .
i do n't know . but i think he 'd be a very pleased .
that s too bad .
just take it with me .
oh i like the song .
i 've been reviewing your work over the past few months . thanks to your excellent work we benefit much from your project . and you should get the perfect attendance award too .
yes . i m pretty sure that we should learn something new from the internet . i m not sure we should try to make it .
you 're welcome jack . it 's on the 2nd of london .
well you might get a little bit of it . i think they may be able to give you some advice .
yes . but it is urgent . you have to pay a refund on time .
my wife will be going back to work soon .
that s a good idea . but after you are so hot i am going to take the dog for a walk .
yes i did .
i love you happy anniversary .
i do n't think much of the film .
i think it is the worst one i have ever seen .
oh i 'm not sure i agree with you . it was not a good one but it was not the worst one . actually it was n't too bad .
i ca n't think the same .
what 's more some scenes were good much fit for the children .
i could n't agree with you .
yes sir . how may i be of service ?
i want to try it .
i never get over it .
i 'm not sure . it could be the tires . let 's stop here .
what 's the material then ?
yes it is . think about it . if you had a police report they would have nothing to do with it .
of course i wo n't do that again .
please her daughter 's in the hospital with her .
of course .
pretty good . i ve just had my new poems published .
congratulations on your success .
thank you .
what can i do for you ?
he is fine .
he s going to be sent to britain to study really ?
yes . he s already got the passport and visa .
fantastic ! please send him my congratulations .
thank you . he s very lucky indeed .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
were you ok ? i thought you had n't told me .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
i 'd like to live here for a job in which i can learn .
you can see the sun shining air . there is no wind only a few people around the world .
we ca n't live without the life here .
so is it true that you want to go ?
yes . how are you ?
and you know the head of the mountain ?
i 'm sick of it too .
well here you go .
it 's no use complaining . if we had got enough money we could n't put up with it and would have moved out .
sure .
how could i feel easy ? i m really pissed .
but you should avoid <unk> when you haven t got the real facts .
ok . i ll try my best to calm down first .
oh i am very sorry hans . thank you for waiting for me . you must have been here a long time already .
it s all right .
i can t either at first but i need your help with the client .
i was in a comfortable place so really it s no problem . i am happy to see you . did the rain hold you up long ?
yes . when i came out of the subway it was raining cats and dogs . and i forgot my umbrella . so i had to wait for the rain to let up .
i totally understand .
she didn t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day s hard work .
poor girl !
not much except that my motherinlaw is driving me up the wall .
what 's the problem ?
i need a hand with the fax machine .
for example ?
some of the stories in it are from people who are interested in . besides i know there are many shops and newspapers that are experts in <unk> and future .
no i ca n't see that happening . i know you 're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
it 's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .
my motherinlaw used to do the same thing to us . if it was n't disciplining them enough then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them the schools we sent them too and everything else under the sun .
you 're right . but what do you think we do as different as we do n't get too many animals as possible ?
she thinks i 'll call a lawyer .
she 's terribly sorry about that . she had to leave the office suddenly and wo n't be able to return until next week . she hopes you understand .
hi steven .
sure honey i was . i ran into bill and i m alright . .
yes i think i 'll be .
i didn t think of it . which direction are you going ?
that 's right .
well that s a good idea . we can always talk about the possibility of a meeting and there s nothing to deal with .
no problem .
my boss sent me a message and asked me to go home just now .
what s the time ?
really ? it s an important thing to do .
who do you think it is ?
you can take a birdeye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain .
we have a wide selection of chinese antiques and porcelain . do you like it ?
is he still single ? i ca n't believe that he 's a very good man to live with a company .
oh yeah !
watch my language or you ll be sure .
i m sure you do miss that type of cooking . but can t you try to get used to western food ?
i have tried . but americans like butter bread sugar and cream too much .
i suppose you re right lee . maybe that s why so many westerners are overweight .
it s interesting that americans work very hard at their jobs do not take naps during the day and yet they can be so heavy .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too much fast food and that food is very fattening .
why don t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy being outside working during the day ?
what do you suggest ? i can t afford to quit my job until i get a new one .
maybe you have two choices . you could attend school during the day or you could get a position that provides training .
really it 's so beautiful .
you can say that again .
you must n't pick it in this place .
where it is ?
it 's a private garden .
is that better ?
i would like to transfer some money .
sure . here is your bill . it comes to 84 .
why not ?
i know it 's a chinese new concert . it s so beautiful .
i bought it yesterday afternoon .
will that 'll be the sixth of september .
i m afraid you can t .
where is the fitting room ?
oh come on . we can see the scenery better .
did you like reading books ?
i know you love the oscars .
i am sorry i am very busy . but i have to go .
we can just have a break . why don t you join us ? we have n't been to the hospital for a few days .
that s true . but why are you so crazy about it ?
i m sure . . .
ok . just think it 's funny . oh do n't tell me you did n't he ?
alright . i understand .
do n't worry . i ve got a really light week . you are going to look a bit sore .
how many tickets do you have ?
i do n't know . well my contract here is for one year and i do n't know what i should do after that . maybe going around for a while .
well have you ever thought about learning some chinese ?
actually i am learning that now . but it 's too hard for me . you know the four tones and the stuff . it really <unk> me out .
do n't worry . all things are difficult but easy .
you hit the nail right on the head .
well are you invested in some <unk> program ?
what is it ?
it 's a job at a recruitment agency .
awesome . i 've been giving this a lot of thought . when can we do this ?
how about this sunday ?
ok cool .
good . i 'll give you a call tonight .
no problem .
i would like to know the problem with your daughter .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
of course .
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
i am not in the mood .
why are you feeling depress ?
i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . it 's a real letdown .
i do n't think she would do such a thing .
but she did and it made me disappointed .
oh cheer up . a girlfriend is not everything .
but she means a lot to me .
then forgive her mistake .
oh . i just can t forget it .
do you like to know anything about stocks ?
yeah i 've got some here . but i am not sure if i can learn .
it says keep off the grass !
you have a lot of girls here . it 's a good place to go to the food .
i need to get a costume for a fancy dress party and i reply do n't know what to get . will you come shopping with me ?
yes i like it very much .
i 've never had one person that i 'd idolized . the comparisons to julia roberts are incredibly flattering . i do n't really know what to do . i do n't think i would be a good thing . i 'm sure you have to do n't enjoy it .
oh sorry again thank you .
oh that 's all right . why do n't you try to get up early ?
all right i 'm finished .
where to sir ?
you dance beautifully too .
you can say it again .
i agree .
which one do you mean ?
some people say that . they are my favorite .
oh my god . i 've forgotten about it . you 're a new student too .
yes . it is a fantastic place .
i 'm always interested in how but seldom pay much attention to who .
sure . the first place you should do is relax . you will love it .
well actually i do n't have time to finish my homework . i will .
what 's your parents opinion ?
i 'm really sorry . i like it . well i 'm sure you will like it .
it does n't matter . i can still attend the day after tomorrow .
yes . please help me reserve the table .
i 'm so glad you like it .
i 'd like a glass of orange juice please .
sure no problem . do you happen to have the receipt ?
ok . i 'll try it .
here you are .
i am sorry too . i know we 've been talking about this beach trip for a while . i should have told bob i was busy this weekend .
do n't be silly . you guys should spend as much time together as you can . besides we can go to the beach anytime .
thanks for understanding .
well that 's what being friends is about is n't it ?
hey what if the three of us go to the beach together ? besides you and bob have n't seen each other for a while . i do n't want my boyfriend to be complete strangers .
nah i would n't worry about that . but i do n't want to be the third wheel . you two should have some quiet time to yourselves .
i know bob wo n't mind . you can bring a date like that guy from the bar you keep talking about .
maybe . . . i 'll think about it .
well last night i had a big argument with ann .
terrible . it must be something serious . you two are such close friends .
now that i look back at it it was n't that big a deal . i should n't have lost my temper .
really ? what happened ?
well as you know i have to the bottom .
that 's pretty harsh .
i know but i was so upset . i mean come on ! does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ?
you know she probably feels just as bad .
well i think i was being a little selfish myself . i know they do n't get to see each other very often .
well in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding . you should n't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . after all you can go to the beach anytime you want .
yeah i 'll call later to patch things up .
that 's very kind of you to say so . let 's try some <unk> wines .
great . sweet wines are my favorite . they always make a great finish to a decisions meal .
do you prefer brandy or ports .
port please .
excellent choice . i love its smooth flavor .
the port is quite exquisite . it must have spent years aging in barrels . am i right ?
yes . you always have a good nose for wines .
next time we are about to dinner we should try some canadian ice wine .
oh what 's that ?
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
why not ? it sounds great .
ok here 's to your health .
thanks . cheers .
cheers .
yes . i have to work on saturday all day .
i 'm going to the airport to see the doctor . how about you ?
i 'm sorry . but our flight is full . that should have been canceled .
yes sir . we have your reservation . could you fill up these forms please ?
i m confused about the projected revenues .
that 's the problem .
they are n't too familiar with doing business outside of japan . there are a lot of cultural differences to account for .
do you think the red line is good ? it 's been a good good shot !
exactly .
but if he has no one to turn it into two parts .
he had no idea . he was so 50 years old .
that s exactly what i was thinking . i mean did you to him a happy job ?
i know that . he was just told by the police and could n't get any .
what happened ? did you see him ?
i bet my button dollar that he wo n't .
what s wrong ? that was a great goal .
yes but i bet 200 dollars on the cougars !
looks like you re going to lose out on this game then .
i can t believe it ! i thought the cougars were going to win for sure .
what were the odds ?
20 to 1 in favour of the cougars !
too bad .
what is it ? what happened ?
i think someone is stalking me .
no it ca n't be . really ? who ?
i do n't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking but staring . he just kept staring at me . he did n't stop .
what did you do ?
i saw the guy come in with a gun .
did he leave when you left ?
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .
what did you do ?
that 's about five blocks . and around corners too . so he was definitely following you .
yes he was . i 'm not imagining it . finally just when i got home i turned around and looked at him . he was just standing there . he did n't smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious . what should i do ? i 'm so scared . can i call the police ?
actually i do n't think you can call the police . not yet at least . he has n't done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it . but if anything happens again then maybe you should call .
why ca n't i call the police now ? he was definitely following me !
of course you can call the police if you want . that 's not what i mean . i 'm just saying that they probably wo n't do anything .
i suppose . what can they do ? i do n't even know who he is .
listen carol . do n't let this bother you too much . probably it 's nothing . just keep your eyes open when you go out . if you see him a third time and if he follows you again then i think we should go to the police . but for now just try not to worry .
alright . and i wo n't go to that cafe for awhile .
more or less . there 's just one thing bothering me .
oh ? what 's that ?
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
what kind of family is he ?
it 's an egyptian carpet . the student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . seeing what gift was i was really uncomfortable . i mean it 's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . i do n't think i 've done anything to
you refused the gift ? that 's terrible .
i know but i really ca n't accept such an expensive gift . i explained to him why but he seemed really upset about it . i think he might have taken it the wrong way .
perhaps . he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
that 's what i am worried about . i do understand the respect attached with the gift and i am honored . but i really do n't think it 's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . i think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .
no . worse than that . i 'm in a hurry .
can you tell me how to get to the jade buddha temple ?
it 's not serious . but i would n't like to have a cup of tea .
ok i will go to the police station and get it fixed .
i see .
do you think that you can find a good price for that ?
i 'm not sure . i like the settings .
do you have a lot of room ?
well there 's a problem with your rent and air conditioning .
really ? do you think they can get a subscription to the magazine ?
will you make it the police ?
i see .
i think someone is stalking me .
i see . do you have the house a friend ?
yes it is . think about it . if nobody paid any attention to anything then what 's it all for anyway ?
i see . well do you think it 's a good idea to get through the customs ?
oh what a pity . i 've never been there before .
if all the people spit out the gum like you the whole world would become a big trash can .
yes it 's a very wellknown kind of spirits in mexico . people drink it with salt and lemon .
never mind . i do n't want to waste my time on this .
which one ?
you can take a birdeye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain .
well i do n't think the weather will be boring . besides the rain is long too . maybe we can go to a concert .
well there was a lot of english in the weather . there were some coworkers that went first time .
i really appreciate it and was an excellent party .
we will inform you of our team .
yes . it has . look there s so many birds around it .
yes i did . i put it on the chair a few pictures . i ca n't believe it .
we have to get there early morning .
my birthday comes next month . i want to hold a birthday party too .
yes we are . we can find some relaxing <unk> .
then i came back here .
how do you like the gross weight ?
how are you these days ?
yes .
i 'm planning to travel to europe next year . i 'd like to go to beijing and have a good time .
well you 'll still have to do some shopping on these two things .
it s beautiful .
you have to attend the conference room in wo n't it ?
yes it 's not going to be the party of the city .
one person ? how about your girlfriend ?
how much do are you looking to spend ?
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
how do you get along with them ?
would you like anything else ?
how about going to school tomorrow ?
hello john .
no i do n't think we have .
no i have n't .
you said it . he really needs our money .

of course i do . but i am not a good movie as it is .
really ? i thought it was a great chance to see it .
that 's for sure . you know i had the greatest time ever .
is n't that a bad movie ?
oh speaking of the conductor he is indeed a genius . he did a perfect job . his name is menuhin a descendent of russian american immigrants .
no wonder you brought such a big bag today .
i believe it will . well then let 's go to a concert .
will you be able to do the piano ?
yes i am . what 's wrong ?

he lost his kids college money day trading .

it is marvelous and the piano is about all the european family .

how many places of china are there ?
yes . they re bucks and <unk> trees .
i think so .
do n't worry . you 'll like the cool colour . it 's of the best .
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
yes i have two hundred and thirtyfive yuan .
after a while crocodile .
i 'm going to need a ride .
we have many kinds of sports such as postcards key chains posters and various arts and crafts .
the attendants fill the tank clean the windscreen and add some air to the tires . all right .

the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
i 'm not sure . it could be the tires . let 's stop here .
what kind of program do you have ?
it bears a great many of advantages but also some weak points .
is it ? i 've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
for instance the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .
that 's true . some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
actually it 's not the fault of the mobile phone . but people should have a proper attitude towards it . mobile phone is a tool serving people not the fetters restricting them .
i 'm sorry but to be frank you are going to have to work overtime .
i know but i am afraid .
they probably going to keep you in touch with the <unk> .
you really think i have to do that . i could go to the gym to get some exercise to keep fit .
well let me see . i 'm not sure i 'll pass the project down to the weekend .
i will .
no problem .
yeah . water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues .
but what are the sources of water pollution ?
they could generally be divided into two categories direct and indirect contaminant sources .
how long are the vegetables ?
yeah . they are emitted directly into urban water supplies .
but what about the indirect ones ?
indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater .
i see . for the sake of us all we should be an active participator in the prevention of it .
sure . it 's an issue asking for everyone 's participation .
okay let 's call it a day .
that 's pretty tough !
politics can be a expensive job .
you mean what 's happening ? well constable i 'm trying to get out of the windowand fred is helping me .
yes . here we are .
he lost his kids college money day trading .
which is better ?
senior account rep .

i 'm not sure . the city is too small to live on the subject of putting together .
that 's ok . have you got the copy machine ?
yes it will . but it 's hard to get used to the heat in my city for example .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
how much do you spend on your time after the whole year ?
that 's true . you have to pay the attention of those programs .

seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? that 's a good idea . let 's go !
hey darling i think i might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . i was so relaxed . it felt as if i were in another world .

i 've got it . i like the sound of stepping on the snow very much .
oh . . . boring .

how big was it ?
no he did n't . he was a <unk> player .
the ball is coming .
yes they are a real wife wife .
yes i 've got it .
you had a very good journey . what did you do ?
how about this one ?
and it takes two to make a quarrel and it takes two to mend fences .
i got a new bicycle in the morning .
yes you 're right . if we do n't have any obligations or commitments on that i can see what the side of the city .

yes . there are so many birds of the opera art .
yes should . the most important thing is to be able to grow them well .
ha ha ! it seems that people and the key to stop anything like we both work on the spot .
no i do n't think i am .
what do you consider your work ?
sports .
that s interesting . what kind of stamps do you want ?
you 're new to make it .
i like almost all kinds of sports . but i also like to listen to classical music .
i agree . playing is a very aggressive experience . all the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . whenever i start a chess game i ca n't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all <unk> stand ready to kill .
no i just ca n't play it well .
i agree with you .
that would be lovely . but now let 's go and get a drink .
not much . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .
oh that 's exciting . what 's this guy like ? is he hot ?
well i <unk> n't think so at first . but as we started talking i found his extremely funny and witty . i could n't stop laughing at his jokes ! we have so much in common . we like the same teams music a
it seems you two are a good match . what qualities do you look for in a friend ?
there 's nothing definite i think . i do n't have a list or anything but when i first meet somebody i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have a radar h
well that 's something i 've never heard of . but if you as me what i value most in a friend i would have to say honesty .
i agree . you ca n't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .
yeah i know . a friend in need is a friend indeed . i do n't need fairweather friends either .
i like doing aerobics in my spare time . it 's good for my health .
there are many hobbies . i like to go to the computer and buy a computer program for myself .

i 'm so bored . i do n't know what i 'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning .

it 's a good thing you can speak english !
you can do it in the evenings .
how do i get there ?
you see i do n't think that is a good idea . what about the fiveday flying journey ?
how much is the fee ?
it depends on the job you have learned at any other languages .
i know . but there is a great deal . it 's not the things we do here .
i do n't think it 's just the fault of my credit card .
how else will i be able to spend on both of them ?
i m sorry . don t worry . i ve never been to the school for a few weeks .
can i have a look at the author 's name ?
this is a little bigger . it 's much better than our dog .
yes i adore simple fashions . how does it look on me ?
that s right .
whew ! i like the sound . how much do you think i should borrow ?
i usually do it on weekends . i usually look for about them on my own .
even though the ball is coming at the end of the game he saw it with other girls .
turn on the radio ? what for ?
cool ! i 've never seen such a beautiful state . how much was they ?

i 'm not sure . it could be the tires . let 's stop here .
you can hear from a local internet business it many models .
so you didn t buy a big vacation ?
my pleasure . i 'd like to try my best .
so the goods are received in apparent good order and condition ? i 'm sure it will be a good hike to the cases .
yes sir .
how about going there to have a look now ?
yeah . . . how about the korean 's ? they have no idea where they 're .
oh that 's easy ! maybe it 's just a good deal .
i heard them are a lot of fun .
of course the local internet will be more convenient .
that 's right . it must be very convenient and fast .
you put it in the slot at the turnstile and then push the turnstile to get into the platform .
i also want to say that the new models will be a competitive one .
i 've got a bad headache and a cough .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . you can go on a date with her .
she told me that she had a sudden she was n't very interested in it .
in such a big family there must be a head .
yes i think i do .
you said it . he s a very good thing that he s done . it s a very difficult thing to get together .
but i don t think i 'm feeling a real fan of cake .
i 'm going to work at a hospital for an international retirement school .
what school do you go to ?
i 'm studying languages . this year i 'm doing german and italian .

i can take a taxi instead of the thing to do . you have to wait for a long time .
thank you i guess so .
i have thought you had the flu . i feel so tired .
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . .
if you like dance you can often .
ok . i know how to use the computer .
yes . the language is hard to learn but it 's interesting .
i think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than atm processing speed .
take it easy . be sure to get off . i 'll write you a list of what you need .
listen it is waltz . i like the elegant step of the old styles .
no i do n't often dance .
do you have any hobbies ?
how about a beer ?

i hope it will stay fine .
how about this one ? it 's a great place to go .
i 'm afraid not . this is a great game . we have n't seen a game for the football match .
there 's no play chess on the internet . and there 's also the program for that talks .

he 's a very good friend and we are friends .
too bad man tonight is tracy s going away party and she asked if you were gonna go .
i see .
yes i like tea very much .
i do n't see any point in arguing about this . everyone has a right to his own opinion .

okay that 's good .
i will be sending the tour .

that 's very good .
and not expensive either .
that s wonderful . what exactly is the water her name ?
i 'm sorry . but he 's busy then .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
just asking ? but why is your face burning like mad ? ahhuh someone has a crush on jenny does n't he ?
i do n't think so . he just broke up with him .
come on ted do n't be such a chicken . if you like her you ve got to tell her . maybe she likes you .
i know . i just ca n't help thinking of her .
but that 's better than keeping everything to yourself . you 've got to let her know . come on ! you 've got to take a chance ! even though you are rejected it 's not the end of the world ! there 's nothing to lose is there ?
hi linda . i have n't seen you for ages . how time flies !
bottom 's up and you 're right . this meal is incredible . i wish i had known this restaurant before . thanks for bringing me here . i know i 'll be back soon .
i have also been thinking of you . i hope you 'll have a great time !
it s just too bad . i m going to go take the train to the station tomorrow and get it fixed .
i know . one of my favorites are really popular . you should listen to a music player .
they do .
what 's your favorite flower ?
they look very lovely .
ok .

oh i m a teacher .
thank you .
you could ask the policeman .
okay . i 'll be there in a minute .
what s the time ?
ok .
that sounds good . is it ok with you ?
you 're right . we should start visiting the factory . the tour will be eight .
that 's nice . but i have never thought of you before . why do n't you go there and look at the exhibits ?
yeah i was wondering how you like this place ?
i got it on sale down at the last few days .
yeah i 'm just looking forward to it . . . you know i 'm a bit nervous but i do n't want to get all of them in the house .
thank you . that 's very considerate of you . would you like to have a cup of tea or coffee ?
you have made a good choice . but we have made a big deal to you .
i 'm not sure .
she is absolutely wonderful .
how can you control these ?
anything else ?
you said it .
i guess you will be more comfortable in style .
what did you say ? how did you know it 's so bad ?
what 's the date today ?
it 's a lot of expensive .
i guess so . i 'm not used to drinking coffee at all .
that 's what my supervisor did . i do n't know how to get through my job .
you 're welcome . i could meet you again sometime .
thank you .
no i 'm too tired . i 've got to work tomorrow .
miss yang is dating the manager who 's married .
that s great .
yes i d like to know if you could .
you see that means when anything is up for renewal we do it automatically and you do n't have to physically come here to sort it out . all you need to do is sign here and we 'll set it all up for you .
i know . it s always nice to have some closure but i don t think you ll have any trouble finding a place .
i 'm looking forward to meeting at the gate of the factory .
ok .
i 'll meet you in front of the train station .
ok .
what 's the hotel number for us ?
keep in touch .
i hope so . thank you again for the next bus .
what can i do for you ?
i hope so . have a good journey .
it looks like you 're very fond of it .
excuse me miss . can you show me my seat ?
goodbye !
sure . have you got anywhere in mind ?
i 'm starving so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .
that italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . do you want to go there ?
i 'm not really in the mood for italian actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy .
if you want spicy food then i 'd recommend going to a thai indian or chinese restaurant . how about that chinese buffet on <unk> road ?
i really like that restaurant you get a lot for your money there . but they 've westernized their food so it 's not actually that spicy .
you 're right . most of their dishes have sweet sauces . we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us .
the taj ? they 're a bit expensive but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
the taj it is then .
shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
they 'll still charge us a corkage fee .
that 's right . it 'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .
do n't worry about money . i 'll treat you tonight .
are you sure ? we could go dutch .
no i 'll pay . it 's my turn anyway . you paid last time .
i wo n't argue with that ! let 's go !
have we got to .
well how about the classical music club ?
i have to find a place to live .
do n't render me lipservice you 'd better stay at home tonight .
these are my clothes .
thanks . miss zhang .
thank you !
i ve been working hard lately . i was thinking of doing a lot of work .
oh are you there ?

judge from his look he 's a very serious person .

do n't believe him . he 's a liar .
we cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth .
she 's very nice .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .

mm . . . it 's quite warm now .

i 'm very worried doctor . i have a terrible headache .
i 'm pretty busy these days . how 's everything going ?
what time are you leaving ?
good to see you too !
i like the plot . it 's very exciting .
why ?
i need to get a costume for a fancy dress party and i reply do n't know what to get . will you come shopping with me ?
i like spring too . we can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air .
i think someone is stalking me .
let me tell you the story . in 1892 patty smith hill and mildred hill wrote a song called good morning to you . but later someone added the words happy birthday to their tune .
no it 's too crowded . i 'm afraid .
do n't worry . the bus tour is really worth while . you can enjoy the whole city in a single day .
uh . . . yeah right . . .
we 'd better go out for a walk .
which season do you like best ?
i like the plot . it 's very exciting .
how about summer ?
i dislike it most .
why ?
i need to get a costume for a fancy dress party and i reply do n't know what to get . will you come shopping with me ?
but sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
i am so happy that i have been calm and roll to the clock yesterday .
i hope it does .
yes he is .
it 's . . . oh it 's the 1st april fool 's day .
you forgot all of about it did n't you ?

27th day of the fourth month .
by the way could you tell me when the film will begin ?
it will begin at 5 thirty .
is it a long one ?
oh come on ! it is really a surprise .
i do n't want to miss it today .
well there was a lot of english in the weather . there were some coworkers that went first time .
what did you say ? i think it was great .
we will inform you of our team .
yes it has . look there s so many beautiful view on the lake .
yes .
we have to get there early morning .
we watched lots of television and films .
how do you like the gross weight ?
how are you these days ?
me too . recently i 've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them .
do you have any hobbies ?
i 'm afraid not . to me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
no i m sorry . i didn t know it was going to be so late . i m not sure i ll get to the car .
ok let s go .
they are . the <unk> for dessert . if they are hidden them we can try to bring you a lot of information .
when did you start worrying about your weight ?
crazy !
i see . what 's this one like ?
do n't you see many people who are in the same mess ?
how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look ? i remember there is one in the gym .
that 's a good idea . you have n't tried moroccan .
what 's that ?
i have n't decided yet .
i agree . they 're very lovely especially huan huan .
i was n't happy with you .
the five dolls are sold together as a set and they 're priced according to the size . the bigger they are the more expensive .
oh i see . if i buy more than a set can i get any discount ?
i do n't think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now .
any other ideas ?
there are lots of things such as postcards key chains posters and various arts and crafts .
it all sounds great . we can go there after the match . i ca n't wait to see what they have .
i m going to take a trip off to the vacation .
how long is it ?
it s usually a little strange but i d like to take a bus .
i 've never been to chicago .
the train is higher than the bus . it can be too expensive for any kind of ride .
actually i do n't agree . i think we 'll miss the bus .
the house is small but a lot of people are subway .
oh i see . i like horror movies because i like the unborn .
yes . but americans never seem to have the same thing .
ok hold it . remember to be punctual next time

i can see that . but this is my first time asking for leave .
i m sorry to hear that .
how many people are you married ?
yes . i m pretty booked up .
well nothing . it s just one of those days . everyone at the office is sick and i m getting blamed for work not being done .
have you had any aches and pains ?
i ve been having a hard time sleeping lately .
that s enough . have you got any certificate of your health ?
i couldn t have been you had a fell for a few days now ?
joe ? i do n't know what you mean .
i remember you are in love .
oh i took a shine to him when we met for the first time . but it comes and goes .
it 's greek to me .
so the reform can not be carried out well .
the government is making efforts to change situation .
easier said than done .
he 's a little sick under the weather .
what ? it s only 9 p . m . now . why today he went to bed so early ?
he said he would rather keep going for a walk .
i bet it .
i 'm tired of your cutanddried opinions . who do you think you are !
how dare you speak to me like this .
why not ?
i 'm sorry .
i have to file a report at the police station .
you are so thoughtful .
i feel the same way .
it must be dreadful to grow old .
it sure is . he has no one to turn to very miserable indeed .
have n't you heard that he is in prison ?
what ? beg your pardon .
john is in prison now . he was copped outstealing .
i just can n't believe my ears !
i ca n't deny that . she is so beautiful that i fell in love with her at the first sight . i wish i knew more about her .
but i heard that she had a threeyearold girl .
i can not belive that . it must be cooked up by someone .
of course i wo n't chill out . opportunity knocks only once .
you should strike while the iron is hot .
you 're right . i will have a talk to her about that .
really ? i thought he loved his wife very much .
yeah . but his relation with sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife .
he deserved it .
sorry i can t .

i know . i always hope for the best and prepare for the worst .
then you will be in line for a doom .

what have you been doing ?
i m thinking about it . i ve never played it .
and the second stage is very popular among teenagers .
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
sorry . no one knows the program has n't been sold .
that is right !
i 'm very sorry to hear that .
so it 's for peter is n't it ?
how so ? i bet it 's like the family .
i 'm very sorry . can you make it any more ?
yeah . but many couples today are destroyed sometimes .
and it takes two to make an agreement too . we all have no guts to follow the ball .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
you do have a point . it s very proud of you .
after all the crises they have survived together her husband should do such things . she s been stabbed in the back .
i feel sorry .
he s a very good person .
yeah . but a lot of people even know that if they take the children out of school .
what are you talking about ?
you seem to be in a hurry .
quite well . i lost my wallet .
ok . do you have a cup of tea ?
that 's the one .
not much . i 've got enough city life in beijing .
yeah . i love going out . what do you want to do ?

i am calling to tell you that i am happy to hear the position you are seeking for .

he does n't . he s a very honest hardworking man .
i see . but why ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
what color are you looking for ?
i have to get up early to go to sleep .
i think you should come and have a try .

anything else ?
oh yeah . he 's good at nothing to do with the staff .
i did n't have any complaints . i did n't know that you used to have any problems . where did you get that ?
i need to get a costume for a fancy dress party and i reply do n't know what to get . will you come shopping with me ?
what are you going to do there ?

ok . here 's the key . take care .
i will . thank you dad .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do it again .
try to be more careful in future .
well i had no idea it was a bit slow . i thought i 'd put up with a hat on me .
it means there is no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials ignite it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .
i did n't really like it .
mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
i found it very disappointing .
she liked the acting too because that 's what she wanted to see .
i was n't happy with it .
nothing is to your satisfaction .

he s nearly 90 .
good gracious ! are you sure ?
i am . what s more his wife is 84 .

i ve been working so hard . i made some friends .
why don t you go and see the doctor ?
tomorrow ? no i 'm afraid i would n't be able to . i 'm going out of the town on business .
well the weather might be too cold there . i could t wait to get out of the city for you . we could go to the beach anytime .
sorry i never go out on saturday evening . i always watch football on saturday evening .
will you come round next tuesday ?
next tuesday ? just a moment ! it will be the 21st of may . oh dear . arm . . . i promised my aunt i would be at her birthday party .
very good you majored in english .
let me see . yes mary . let 's make it next wednesday .
ok . bye .
bye .
i m very glad you could come .
thank you .
what sort of food do you like best ?
i m glad you re enjoying it .
yes just on the phone .
i went to yale university .
did you ? and what did you study ?
i have a b . a . in economics .
would you mind telling me how old you are ?
i 'm twentyseven .
and could you tell me what other jobs you have had ?
yes i have worked in a bank for the last five years .
and what was your salary at the bank ?
i got 500 a week .
thank you . good evening mr . dean .
would you tell us your name please ?
i 'm helen baker .
glad to meet you ms . baker .
glad to meet you too .
where are you from ms . baker ?
i 'm from new zealand .
what do you do for a living ?
i m a salesman .
what do you teach ?
what s the problem ?
here are some leaflets <unk> everything you need to keep the kitchen .
that would be great .
sorry i go for a date on saturday .
what is the date today ?
i m sorry i can t . i ve already got a lunch engagement .
thank you . can i cancel my reservation ?
may be some other time .
tomorrow ? no i 'm afraid i would n't be able to . i 'm going out of the town on business .
well . i d be glad to help .
i d rather you didn t come in any time . what s the weather going on ?
i can t say that . it makes no sense to me . i ll be here for you if i have a good time .
no i have n't but i 've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper .
what kind of job are you looking for ?
i want to find a new job .
you have n't had any experience in either of those fields .
i know . but i 'd like to try . look here are some advertisements that i 've cut out .
i was turned down again . it s frustrating . i guess you ve got to teach me some skills .
me ? i m even less experienced than you are .
at least you know what american women generally like in a man .
believe it or not i guess american women like a man in good shape which chinese women may not care about so much . that s my honest opinion . i know you have been trying very hard .
american men are naturally taller than chinese men . so even if i exercise there aren t many chances .
no that s not true . i ve met two american women who were married to chinese . but those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is jacky chan ? he s small and short . but i bet he can have any american woman he wants .
you know that s going to be a tremendous change for me . because i never exercise .
why don t you try then ? even if it doesn t help you find an american girl you could still have a stronger and healthier body . you won t lose anything by doing that .
hi don . i m surprised to see you again .
yeah i saw someone walking like you but i wasn t sure . we haven t seen each other for how long ? almost three months ? but you look quite different now .
have you noticed what has changed ?
oh you look quite slender and more <unk> . what have you been taking ? are you on a diet ?
yes . i m on a diet but i ve not taken anything . i just eat less and exercise more . and it really worked in the past three months . i ve lost twelve pounds .
wow ! that s great . i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals but it s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . also you know old habits are hard to break .
what kind of exercise do you think i do ? i just go to dance everyday after work . i m taking an amateur dance class . i dance two hours everyday .
dance ? you only go dancing ? that s not hard . i can do that .
sure . join my class next week .
how about we go to the bar across the road ?
hey ! what is it ?
all right . i ll do that then . thank you very much .
yes i 've got two tickets for a newly released film . would you like to see it ?
why ? you 'd better never thought of this game .
thanks . i 'll be back tomorrow .
me too . did you get a chance to work with a company ?
mom i do n't think you 'll be disappointed .
i 'd like to but i 'm not sure if i can .
excuse me ? let me think . how much is it ?
all right then . i 'll have a try .
yes . will it be a great job ?
i see . that 's good news .
like what ? i think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction .
exactly .
i 'm just glad you like it .
i read that story too . they seem to be able to understand men .
really ? i heard that it 's supposed to be wonderful . is it on <unk> costs 80 pounds ?
absolutely ! i do n't think any planes are going anywhere . the sand being blown around has cut <unk> in the water . the sand being hit by the sand being blown around the sand being blown around by the sand being blown around the sand being blown out . besides i think it 's getting a little faster and perfect place to the sand .
i guess so . i 'm getting a bit confused .
well why don t you use a local sim card ?
what if i do n't finish my work by then ?
that 's right . all the bidders will be to to to to make some changes to to to to to to to to to to make sure everything be able to get the responsibility of the business as soon as possible .
well there is no reason to answer the meeting . now who knows that all of the other kids were supposed to be visited ?
no where special . i was just taking a walk .
can i leave a message ?
happy halloween ! what <unk> are you going to dress up as ?
happy halloween ! you got the job right to get forward to your own jokes !
it was a great day for you ! it was a great day for us to get a drink of wine and a plate of beer .
you got it ! how much is it ?
yes . i 'll give you my email address .
i also think they 're right . the problem is that they do n't have enough money to buy a house to live .
yes it 's a <unk> price .
really ? i like them . do you know where the local one is ?
yes that s right .
i overheard this information when i passed arden's office . we got some complaints from consumers yesterday . i am terribly sorry for that .
sure . at least we have a great life .
what are you talking about ?
no not really . why do n't you try the dictionary ?
i think so .
really ? i can t believe you .
i 'm afraid i 'm very ill .
what about this ? it can be worn for woman and you .
i will .
we 'll give you ten yuan for each month .
oh that sounds pretty convenient . where does it pay ?
i can t afford too expensive maybe 50 to 70 ?
i can t wait to see my old camcorder . my wife is so pretty sure .
i ll get them for you at once .
really ? i did n't know the name of the mobile phone . but i do n't know how to get there .
okay . i ll pick you up around 6
i 'll come back at about 430 pm . see you then .
that was a cake walk . it s nothing to speak of .
so what would you do without me ?
sure . i m a girl .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
i know . but you do n't have to worry about that . you wo n't have to pay the fee and use it for your own .
but you know how hard it is to get a good idea . i 'm not sure if he 'll give you a definite answer .
it 's really good . and it 's really expensive .
it 's a citrus fruit .
i see . by the way what 's more it 's exchange rate for all the people 's exchange into the stock market ?
it 's unbelievable .
well it 's the only thing we can do about them .
well it 's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . so unfortunately you 'll lose this 50 rib . we 'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .
but it 's still a lot of money .
i think i would be a good idea . i think i did a great job .
it 's not that bad .
alright . but do n't forget to call next time .
i think someone is stalking me .
so it now and here are a lot of things to order .
that 's right . make sure that the exact time i have to work on my own .
when did you decide to go ?
of course i do . i 've loved working with you .
you can get a free drink .
i guess something is a little too difficult for me . there s always a lot of bad people . i guess in the middle of a bad world we definitely have to work with those who are just friends .
guess !
what ?
it 's been a long time has n't it ?
so i decided to make a deposit . a few months ago the cities were very crowded .
oh i see . well you re looking for a new apartment . we ve got plenty of room and they ve got the harder to break up .
sure ! how about you ?
i m sorry but this isn t a good thing to do . i can t get it .
i saw it in the internet too . i ve always wanted to give it a try .
oh really ?
i bet has been invited to australia for four months .
it 's a onebedroom onebathroom apartment .
can you tell me about some spanish ?
you are in good shape .
that s a bit too much . but i can t afford that .
yes it is . but there are many bedrooms a living room and a big kitchen .
is there a bathroom ?
great . i ll be sure to use the ball .
i 'm going to return it the day after tomorrow .
really ? have you checked everything we asked is not to talk to ?
thank you .
do you really think so ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
i think in some way it is an act of god but in another way it just is caused by us .
for example ?
some of the stories in it are from people who are interested in . besides i know there are many shops and newspapers that are experts in <unk> and future .
oh i see . fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things .
really ? that 's a straws in the wind .
i think so . maybe he 's fallen for her .
yeah . they suit each other . a perfect match between a man and a girl .
actually it 's very nice . i like the design of this one .
oh you didn t have to . . .
well you can have two hearts lucky in love .
i am very happy with it . i 'll take care of it .
is it because of traditional food ?
can i just say that now ? i do n't want to give up my hair .
no i m sorry i can t .
i understand .
i 'm still hungry .
it may be the best choice . let 's see . . . what about the one over there ?
is that all ?
i like beefsteak very much . have you tried chinese dishes ?
yeah i know . but you must have two stress .
that 's what i can do . then i 'll just buy a pair of drinks .
i 'll have a try .
that 's fate .
i feel sorry for her .
maybe this is god 's will .
we have two cleaning ladies . but both of them have received little education .
most cleaning ladies are illiterate . but some of them do a very nice job .
but i actually dislike another lady . she is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . but the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . she would tell you what to do and where to put things .
well i am a little bit out of shape . i think i should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ?
yes i do . i could use the exercise .
it sure is but i 'm going to call hp first just to make sure .
we provide uptodate training on state of the art equipment .
good idea .
well we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . the trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the workout plan .
what else ?
there is a package for all sports channels .
sounds pretty good . how much do you charge ?
that 's the best part .
perhaps one month . i 'll just have a try at first .
let 's hope for the regular customers can recover from the pain of the day .
yes . i 'm fond of playing the chess and i 'm very keen on playing cards .
oh that s interesting and but what kind of things ?
all my friends are about how i can afford them .
stones ? i know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?
yes stones .
well i can t just image it .
not bad . i feel as if you want to have a look at your resume .
thank you . nice to meet you . goodbye .
yes it 's really nice .
what degree do you have ?
thank you . i hope to get into nyu .
it 's a <unk> . what 's your flight number ?
the traffic problem will soon be eased .
oh it s been uh . . . fifteen minutes .
wow ! she is such a chain smoker .
oh man you 've got such a crush on her have n't you ?
yes i know .
honey if you get to me fair oaks and washington .
i like to get a big juicy steak .
i ca n't think it will be . it s not as cold as this weather is here .
i do n't really know what to say to you . i thought you liked patricia .
but you know her favorite girl .
chill out i 'm just trying to help .
i like peach blossom because i like spring .
you 're right . it is probably about the best season .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend .
of course would you like to ask me a few questions ?
i know how i could have . you know how hard it was . i had a bad sense of humor . i am sure i could learn a lot from you .
i used to be a singer . i love music .
i know . and it 's a good exercise to do anything .
oh it was a good game . i have learned a lot from them .
honey you don t have to be too humble .
i 'm afraid you 're right . the medical university has n't been fully prepared .
well i 'm very careful with the development of china and i think it 's much better for me to get a promotion .
oh that s fantastic .
i do n't know . but i am a good singer and you can definitely help me a lot .
i 'm not really sure . but i think i 've got a bad idea .
to begin with you .
they were pretty easygoing .
i have nothing to worry about . i do n't know if there is any call .
i hope to study english literature .
thank you for your kindness . i think i will go for an interview of another .
well you 're a good student . i 'm sure you can do the well .
hmm . in that case i will tell you the truth .
you can give me all my information in the interview .
yes it has the name of the men 's language too . it says that they can add the festival .
oh that 's quite different . we have n't seen each other for a long time . what about this one ?
if your parents want to live with their parents .
sure . but i heard that you are quite interested in seeing them . what do you think ?
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
it 's interesting and i want to buy one home .
yes it has . very high quality is very high in it .
yes it is . very emotional .
not sure . how about you ? they are in the shop of the city .
so you are saying that all these are very important .
it 's interesting and i want to buy one home .
it 's a great place to go . the train will leave soon .
i 'm not sure . i think it 's easy for kids to get on the bus and do n't have to work .
well i am thinking about doing some household cleaning products in taiwan . but i am going to get a master 's degree from university .
thank you . i can also get some information on the internet .
all these say how to them ?
i know . . . how much is the profit margin ?
your salary is very high and the employees are very accept .
i know . i think it 's boring . can we go to the station tomorrow ?
yes i think so . there 's a lot of the the manager to be . i 'd like to see it .
is there a lot of nightlife on this year ?
they sure are .
i can tell you what it 's about .
the food there is actually pretty good .
it 's very nice of you to say so . how about a drink at the new concert hall ?
the food there is actually pretty good .
pardon ?
i must apologize . i 'll buy you a new one tomorrow .
you said it .
i ca n't see it .
you like the food there ?
what would you like to go to the store ?
you like the food there ?
yes i can see it . there are so many tea and i think it 's very famous . i can see there on the radio .
sounds nice . what can we do ?
no i ve never been believe ! i really thought he might win !
yes . what can i do for you ?
how about the lyrics ?
oh my mom was a kid . i did n't know what a ripoff .
i see . you re a good swimmer . can you swim ?
of course .
what about the tour ?
certainly . if you tell me what 's your name and phone number ?
what else can i see in beijing ?
i have no idea where to get it from .
yeah . that s a good idea . what do you think we should do ?
yes of course . i think the great wall of china is a travel agency . it would be great to have a look at the five routes that we can recommend recommend recommend you to the white house .
you see that means when anything is up for renewal we do it automatically and you do n't have to physically come here to sort it out . all you need to do is sign here and we 'll set it all up for you .
it will be a lot easier .
i 'm afraid i ca n't wait . we 'll get it .
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
i need to go out tomorrow evening .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
i like all sorts of movies primarily drama and science fiction .
sure no movie can be any good . what s on ?
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as movies are concerned .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
they are good for nothing .
thanks a lot .
good idea .
yeah it is still nice .
do n't worry . we can send a maid to your house .
look at that big tree over there .
yeah oh my god ! it s still there . we have our first date right on there .
do you know the weather report ? why did you ask that ?
we still need to go to the beach by the way .
but we still have n't .
smile i can t believe this for it s been 20 years since we got married .
what time should i check the weather ?
of course . it was the best size of the year .
how about the lyrics ?
well that s true .
are they ?
what other kind of food do you like ?
oh really ? i thought you are doing the same job .
good idea . i 'll listen to the car radio .
well at least the real feature is the excellent drinks . can i have a look at the invoice ?
you are really a henpecked husband .
of course i do . they are the best friends i can do .
it doesn t matter to me .
it 's the powell orchestra .
ok . it 's all together .
what 's the song ?
but she is not a fine wether friend who could sell you down the river .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
yeah and it 's a good thing to do .
it 's martin <unk> . you liked his film the departed did n't you ?
kobe is a good player .
well you know that he really counts the team as a team .
sure . that 's the plan for its popularity . many of them are so popular .
oh i know .
there s so much i want to do . i ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . i just ran a search for music to download .
i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
thanks . that would be very helpful . i ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . there s too much information on the net .
when you sent your emails did you attach any files to them ?
yes i did . there s an antivirus programme with my email account that <unk> all attachments so i m sure i haven t sent anything nasty to anyone .
when you use the internet be careful not to give out your email address very often . if you do you might get a lot of <unk> email form companies trying to sell you things .
that s good advice . i should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself such as my password and credit car number .
that s right . another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time
how do i do that ?
take this web page for example . press the keys control and d together . click on favourites at the top of the screen . there you are . it has been added to you favourites list . you will
that s useful to know . thanks . i ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .
really ? i m not sure that i would like all the attention . there have been numerous cases of paparazzi <unk> with star s private live in recent years .
i love being <unk> ! if i were famous i d do interviews for all the top magazines like cosmo and elle .
i wouldn t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice but it would get tedious after a while . imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you .
noone really believes gossip columnists .
i think you ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . you d also have to be very careful about every word you said . if you <unk> on a chat show and said something silly it
i think we ll need a good accountant . i could do a lot of work in this country .
that s a great idea . which charities would you support ?
i love children as you know so probably a children s charity .
you d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity so you d really need to be very careful . anyway i d be the first to buy your posters and i d attend your first book
thanks but i m sure it would be difficult to ask the man .
yes it is . thanks . i m just surfing on the internet .
here ? in this cafe ? how can you do that ?
this cafe offers a wireless internet connection . that means i can get on the net for free while i m here . of course i have to buy a cup of coffee !
that s great . can you do it anywhere ?
no . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . there are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
so what programs do you have on your laptop ?
i ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs .
i know you are keen on photography . it s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone anywhere at a
it s wonderful isn t it ? would you like to see some photos that we took recently ?
yes i do . i also use an antispyware program and a firewall . there are so many <unk> on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . you have to be very c
how often do you run your antivirus program ?
i usually run it every few days . it finds a virus about half the time .
which antivirus program would you recommend ?
have you tried this one ? it s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . you can also download updates for free .
that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ?
just a minute . . . go to this one . i ll send you an email with the line in it . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the set up procedures . but they are not complicated .
what do you use your computer for ?
i use it for several thingssurfing the net word processing and creating presentations . i don t play many games on my computer but i do a lot of work with photographs . using a computer program you
great ! i can do all this for you . information on the internet .
i use it almost every day but i usually only use it to check my email . i don t often surf the net . you use the internet a lot don t you ?
yes . i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . it can be frustrating when the connection is poor .
so you re online eight hours a day .
yes i like the job though . sometimes i help other people in the office if they re having trouble online .
how useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?
i think it s fairly useful but there are two big problems . first a lot of the information you find online is false . second when you buy something online you don t see it until you actually get it .
how do you solve the website problems when you re buying something online ?
what i do is find the website of shops . then someone from our company <unk> the shop and buys when they re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .
i d say the main reason is poverty . countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . if their neighbors have some resources they try to steal them by military force .
it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end .
how do you think they could be ended ?
i was n't kidding . she was always a bit nervous . i guess i 'd have to keep a shot .
so if the cause is poverty there should be a program to make the country richer . if the problem is resources share them .
it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality it s harder to make peace between countries .
yes . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .
the problem is that many poor people might suffer .
would you like to live in the country ? i m not sure i d like it .
i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that for me each advantage has its own disadvantage .
what do you mean ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
i think so . there s a lot of traffic in the city . there s a problem of traffic there .
people can t have it both ways . if you live in the country it is often less convenient . if you live in a city it is noisy buy there s more to do .
i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they re so much better to look at than concrete rows of parked cars and tall buildings .
i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . when the wind blows in the city you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .
the view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . there s so sign of pollution . the village looks so peaceful .
just remember that in that village there s nothing to do . there s not even a pub or restaurant . there s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .
you re right . i would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . i would hate living in the country !
no i do n't .
i m fine . are you free ?
i have no idea .
i should have stayed in bed for a few days .
perhaps you have a fight with the victim .
i see . well there are a lot of things to consider .
some of the stories in it are from people who are interested in . besides i know there are many shops and newspapers that are experts in <unk> and future .
that 's right .
why not ! it s a classic in fact it s one of my favorite novels .
but it s so old .
don t judge a book by its cover . do you kwon what it s about ?
no not at all .
oh i 'm sorry .
i didn t realize it was a romance novel . what s the main storyline ?
it s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .
why does he want to do that ?
since he doesn t have a son he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . that way all of his daughters will be cared for .
won t they get his inheritance ?
no that s the problem . though they are welloff once he dies his house will go to his cousin . so when he dies the girls will have nothing .
i see . this sounds interesting ! maybe my teacher isn t so horrible after all .
so are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
there s movie ? my teacher didn t tell me that !
that s probably because she wants you to read the book first .
it would take a lot less time . . .
how about this . when you finish the book . i ll get the movie and watch it with you .
ok . that sounds like a deal .
i only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . i don t think that tv is bad for kids . i think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes .
perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first .
if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch remember to have something else for them to do . if you don t they ll get bored and misbehave .
they could go out and play with their friends .
sure . you could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time .
perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . he watches too much tv too .
that s a good idea . remember that if the parents watch too much tv the kids will probably follow suit .
i like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . but i don t like traveling to work waiting for buses or . . .
or getting stuck in traffic jams when you re driving .
exactly .
it 's gone with the wind .
why do you like it best ?
i enjoy the various characters and the plot .
well . i like the thorn birds best .
is it very interesting ?
sure . i like the writer 's language too .
if i have a chance i 'll enjoy the book .
would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
that 's a good idea . let s go !
it 's the best seller everyone 's been talking about for the last six months .
how in the world did you get a copy ? i 've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i 'm still waiting my turn .
i checked it out of the rental library . it only costs five cents a day .
is it really worth paying for ?
i ca n't tell yet . i have n't got beyond the first chapter .
if it 's any good i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
not a great deal .
i 've just been reading an article about them . they ll be used for all sorts of things now .
for accounting system and things like that you mean ?
yes but they are used for other things too . do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to paris .
yes ?
where is it ?
of course his machine must have been connected to a computer .
that 's right .
thanks a lot . you know what i always feel about but i really feel tired .
do you think that we are a good husband ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
oh yes it almost all happens .
well mary types faster than jones .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
oh what s he like ?
well he s got dark hair and brown eyes .
yes .
you see that means when anything is up for renewal we do it automatically and you do n't have to physically come here to sort it out . all you need to do is sign here and we 'll set it all up for you .
um that s good .
okay but he s got a wife and 3 children as well .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .
what is it ?
i feel sick .
what makes you say that ?
well i just need to make and receive calls and it 's quite reliable . i find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong you know ? i mean this camera function for instancehow often do you use it ?
oh that 's too bad . work harder next term .
b i 'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me .
do n't lose heart . everything will be fine .
you are going to put on a cup of tea .
yes of course . this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
i m glad you re enjoying it .
thank you for the invitation .
it s my pleasure . can i get you another glass of champagne ?
yes please . thank you for everything .
sorry i can t .
tomorrow night then ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
that s sounds great .
ok . how about give me a ring then ?
no . i d better not .
why not ?
i have no idea where to get it from .
i m looking at my horoscope for this month ! my outlook is very positive . it says that i should take a vacation to someplace exotic and that i will have a passionate summer fling !
what are you talking about ? let me see that . . what are <unk> ?
it s a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign . you have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . i was born on april 15th so i m an aries . when were you born ?
january 5th .
let s see . . . you re a capricorn . it says that you will be feeling stress at work but you could see new exciting developments in your love life . looks like we ll both have interesting summers !
that s bogus . i do n't feel any stress at work and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
no it s not your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . see ? it says that an aries is energetic and loves to socialize .
well you certainly match those criteria but they re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ?
a capricorn is <unk> and practical . she likes to do things in conventional ways . that sounds just like you !
ok ! how about <unk> ?
no no a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . i m going to describe someone s face and you guess who it is !
ok !
first you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl and whisk them up quite so they 're quite high and fluffy and in a hot pan and you need a pan that 's kind of small that the sides go up at an angle . you put some oil and heat it up so
our cousin pete ! my turn ! she has a <unk> nose <unk> nose <unk> eyes and a mole on her chin !
aunt rose ! that mole is so huge ! ok my turn . he has a crooked nose and full lips . he has quite a few freckles and an oval face . oh he is also bald !
your future husband !
not funny .
i 'm watching tv .
mumm . no .
it s only the day when the world s biggest sporting event is kicking off .
what ?
you can take a birdeye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain .
i have no idea what you re talking about . the only sporting event we watch at home is the super bowl .
this is bigger than the super bowl man ! teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . they first start in a group stage with bigger groups each g
sounds interesting but soccer doesn t really appeal to me .
are you kidding ? over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup ! it s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! each nation is cheering on their team hoping they will bec
yeah it sounds so interesting ! what about these things ? we can t use what he s talking about !
whatever i m going to go watch the opening match .
mine was ok except that no one in my class speaks english . i guess it will force me to <unk> in chinese more in class so at least i should improve a lot this semester .
that s both fortunate and unfortunate . it s the united nations in my class ! we have people from all over the world ! there are three germans a pole a scottish two french an american a brazilian
that s the array of nationalities . everyone in my class is from asia except me . there are a few south koreans several japanese malaysian thai singaporean filipino kazakhstan and o
well i think you re pretty lucky actually . you ll have the opportunity to learn so much about asian culture .
i guess so but i think it s going to be hard to relate to my classmates especially with the language barrier . i think i might change classes .
don t ! stay the course ! your spoken chinese will be eternally grateful . i bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice .
i highly doubt it . your girlfriend is chinese .
well there is that yes .
it s a nice day to get out of the city and we re planning to go out and enjoy the nice weather ! this looks like the perfect spot ! ok kids put on your sunscreen while your mom and i set up ca n't sleep out tonight .
there we go . can you help me with the umbrella ? perfect .
ok kids here <unk> beach ball and a frisbee a pail and a shovel . i want to see an impressive <unk> by the time we leave . don t stray too far . wait ! leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes
and stay in the shallow area . i don t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! it s too deep out there and we didn t bring your floatier .
you re back already ? the water was too cold huh ? i ll tell you a secret . do you see that small pool of water over there ? it ll be warmer in there . go see if you can find some seashells or catch some
what is that ? a jellyfish ? jeremy put that down right now ! it could sting you !
ah ! not on me ! ow !
i want to think of it for some time .
yes !
what are you talking about ? it wasn t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family !
hmm . . . i hope to go too . do you know where i got from ?
she is the mature stable feminine type . i hope one day i can marry her .
you re right . i ll be back until tomorrow .
that 's a good deal .
wow ! does she have a bad besides the bad news ?
yes it does look a bit sore . let 's take your extra way of your chest and give you a few tests .
thanks for your help . i am really looking forward to hearing from you about this job .
oh while we 're on the subject what happened to you and your secretary ?
of course ! we re going to be great !
ok . if you make it we can t be happy for your promotion we will include the insurance forms and the tuition fees ready by monday .
so if we decide to buy something for a new one ?
it was always very busy there .
and we re glad to hear that .
how come you re getting on the shirt ? i m sure you re in the countryside with that s all of these things .
nice to see you .
i do but i love you more than ever had time to get to dinner .
you think so ?
yes it s a fruit dish made by my friends .
i do n't know . i m sure the best friend is coming . i can go and get a drink .
so i do n't have any . . .
okay i think you 're right . i also decided to throw away a salad !
it is so annoying . i hope my boss will be relieved and meet me .
yeah of course !
yes someone give me a ring .
really ? i thought i probably just had a bad idea .
what happened ?
i think someone is stalking me .
ben we re fifteen . what kind of job are you looking for ?
oh just for a position as a gas station attendant . you know starting at a simple lowly job just like all the greats before they made it big in the world .
uhhuh .
but i m just in it for the money right ? how else am i going to be able to afford to keep taking angela to the movies ? besides i love the smell of gasoline don t you ?
yeah ? you finally decided to wipe the slate clean ?
you got it ! i have a new job i m living in a new city with new friends ! this is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way i live my life .
so what are you going to do ? take up an art class or something ?
well first of all i ve decided to stop smoking . it s not that i m pinching pennies or anything it s just that i ve been smoking since i was sixteen and i think it s time to stop .
i m with you on that one . anything else you re planning on doing ?
one last thing i ve decided to come out of the closet .
it s about time !
sir you have to go right away .
i m afraid what i m doing .
what ! i thought you said about it .
look at the light over there . it s so beautiful . is it a name that i can t wait !
oh she s good . hey look at her . she has the final word .
you know how hard i am for this job . but they re not so professional .
where do you work ?
of course i did . but what do you think about that ?
do you have any idea how to get there ?
how would you like your coffee ?
i 'm going to <unk> the lawn .
i like the fish . it 's very delicious .
i 'll sing real well .
i need to get a costume for a fancy dress party and i reply do n't know what to get . will you come shopping with me ?
i 'm not sure . let s go to the film . how about you ?
you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise .
it does n't matter . the movie was too slow .
see you too .
i hope i can do something soon .
it s easy to say .
oh good to see you again .
thanks .
i hope you 're hungry .
i went to a movie theater in the public park . it s very nice .
what ?
you can always go home and make something to eat .
i will . you know as a newcomer i think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere .
a good idea .
i only need to buy a new bedroom set .
i 'd like to . i 'm going to bed early .
ok .
you should .
what 's the date today ?
no i have n't .
it 's fine today .
by the way will you be home this afternoon ?
yes i find jogging does good to me so i keep on doing it .
you 've formed a sound habit .
i think so too .
it will . but if i want my home one i can t use my key to get hurt .
that 's very considerate of you .
as you know we have about 30 seats . there 's nothing more but i think there 's probably the room for everyone else .
okay . i know there are a lot of stray too .
ok i was looking forward to seeing you .
yes i see what you mean . how about the work ?
well i want to be like that . you know it 's not a bad movie .
i sure did .
that s unless there is a traffic jam .
i ca n't help you . why do n't you talk to her ?
i am sorry . i do n't like fish .
how about some salad to be ?
do you have any idea how to turn into the meeting ?
no i 'm afraid we ca n't .
the cranberries . i love their music . how about you ? do you like them ?
where did you go ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
i 'd like a cup of coffee .
how long will the tour take ?
i had my first cigarette when i was seventeen .
not yet . i 'm still looking through the classifieds . wish me luck .
i would recommend you buy me a new computer .
what 's the email address ?
hi john ! i have n't seen you for ages .
yeah i 've been out of town .
so how have you been ?
great ! work is really busy now but it 's fun .
you 've got to have stayed in bed for ten minutes .
it 's no problem .
alright . there is one thing .
ok . let s go .
hey andrew . how 's everything with work ?
ok i guess . my boss has been on my back recently .
really ? what 's he been doing ?
you know just giving me lots to do . i 'm really busy right now .
are you ? what are you busy with ?
oh lots of things . mostly training new people .
yeah i guess you 're out of the town .
oh i 'm afraid i ca n't . you can learn more about the new computer .
they are playing <unk> .
you can always take a birdeye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain .
that suits you very well . it s very hard to say .
oh i know . i ca n't wait to learn french . they are all hard to learn .
all right all right . goodbye .
six o 'clock in the afternoon .
well as you probably know on the bus . and you do n't have much time to play .
ok i promise .
oh good . i 'm going to the gym now . you can use the stations .
sure it 's fine .
yeah i think so . oh by the way i need to ask you something .
what 's that ?
you can either get dialup or del .
sure . oh that reminds me . could i borrow your black leather boots ?
my boots ? er . . . sure ok .
i 'd like to go to tianjin .
you re a real man !
yes i know that . but i was in there for a while . i thought you had n't been in love with her for more than a while .
i 'm glad you enjoyed it .
no . but i m sure she is a good girl .
wow ! this sounds like something my wife would really enjoy ! are there any outdoor activities we can take part in ?
thank you .
i think so . in fact many people think that our public transport department will be able to work overtime and their service .
george how can we ? vacations cost money . and this month we don t have much money left after paying the rent .
well lili we can visit different places in the state in our van . we are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . trust me it won t cost much .
where will we sleep then ?
in the van .
what about other expenses ?
let s see . gas food recreation we won t spend much . come on . don t hesitate . we need to get out of the house once in a while . we have been working hard haven t we ?
maybe you re right . when do you plan to go ?
the sooner the better ! i can t wait !
oh i don t know where we re going yet .
as long as we re going you can decide where to go . i trust your <unk> . i know you miss chinese food so we can eat at a chinese restaurant this time .
let s go to chicago . we can have lunch in chinatown . then we can go to a ball game at <unk> field !
ok . i m going to go fast . we can go to the nearby after dinner .
i found the ideal position . i m working for a plumbing company .
are you serious ? you studied mathematics at college for four years and now you have a job working with your hands !
plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge and creativity . i love this job .
i can see that . but i didn t know you had experience in that line of work .
i didn t but i applied for an apprenticeship and since i studied math and i have a good attitude 4 my application was accepted .
congratulations ! you do have the right attitude .
you can t take the money . you have to give it a little money .
i recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . it may offer you many benefits . first it 's good for your health . i 'm afraid it 's not necessary for me to further elaborate . while lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising a bike ride to work not only <unk>
we can visit the great wall of the city for a while . it s called the great wall .
why do n't you go with me ?
i needed to get some money .
i couldn t possibly hire you .
i 'm a real team player .
sorry i m not a <unk> . i d rather play football .
ok . and keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over you 'll only have to cook that side lightly . put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the
yes i do . i like playing football and basketball .
do you usually go to the computer store ?
i can only go to the gym for about 15 minutes .
you ? i go to the gym every day . do you want to come with me ?
i know .
thank you for your advice . i will try it .
palmistry ? what is that ?
it 's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future .
oh you mean palm reading . i 've seen that before but i do n't believe in it .
are you sure ? i 've read a lot about palmistry and i 've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . do you want me to take a look at your hand ?
really ? you 've read books about it ? ok then . but only if you want to .
ok let 's see well you 've got a long life line which is good and the love line is strong . .
what else do you see ? will i be successful ? will i make a lot of money ?
hmm hard to say wait yes it looks like you will do well in business and your ambition will help you a lot but . .
what ? what is it ? what 's the matter ?
you seem to have a large gullibility line . you believe everything that you 're told .
how about the <unk> ?
no not really . why do you ask ?
because i want to tell you about the time that i saw a ghost .
you saw a ghost ? when ?
it was many years ago when i was a little child . it was the middle of the night and i went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . i walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs when . .
so that 's where you saw the ghost ? in your house ? what did it look like ? was it hideous ?
it was a big green thing that looked like a person . it was in the kitchen and it slowly moved towards the stairs . . .
so what did you do ?
i was responsible for helping patients restore their organic functions training them in speech and organism carrying our massage and physiotherapy taking care of patients nutrition and diet .
until what ? what happened ? did you see it clearly ? did it attack you ?
it moved slowly up the stairs step by step and i could hear its approaching footsteps . when it finally got to the top of the stairs i realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . he had gone to get a late night snack .
i just found out that my husband is cheating on me .
you mean mark ? he seems like such an honest guy .
that 's what i thought . it seems that he 's been seeing someone else for about two months .
two months ? how did you find out ?
i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . i picked it up and a girl asked to talk to mark . she then asked if i was his sister and i said no i was his wife . she hung up immediately .
so you asked him about the girl who called ?
yeah he first said it was someone from work . he gave me a lame excuse and so i pressed him on it .
what 'd he do ?
he kept trying to make stupid excuses and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion .
i see . well it is not the notes you can say anything about him .
yes . but you see he has already read the count on it .
it s so sad . he s a hard job and now .
i would when i was a young boy .
thank you .
yeah . i know him . and he is also very smart .
i think i should try to quit my job and have a good time .
do you have a brochure about that company ?
how do you get along with them ?
i suppose you 're right . i also think the <unk> between the greens are a bit long especially for such a hot climate .
no . you can only do it when you re in the past few years .
well it s not just the girl s fault . it s also society 's fault magazines and ads that show thin models all saying it is in to be thin . it s hard for them not to listen .
well do you know if i can go to the restroom ? i ca n't wait to watch the football game .
nothing really .
that sounds interesting . i can t wait to check out a holiday for that .
good idea . i 'm sure it 's a good idea to have a good time .
correct . but it 's <unk> .
what do you say if it is impossible to get the ball ?
i know what you mean . we could go to a movie and make it . there 's so much noise in the park .
i love the oscars . you know much about the oscars .
i do n't think so . either i do n't think we should change our name .
how do you pay for it ?
i 'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments .
tell me if you need help .
no i am not eating there anymore . i have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . the food served in the cafeteria is not my type . i am a total meat lover . but the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . they have been serving the chinese cabbage and
that s fine with me . i don t hate vegetables and i don t eat much during lunch .
well then the cafeteria suits you best . but anyway if you like to have a lunch outside the company feel free to join me anytime .
i 'm going to graduate this summer .
where are you going to work then in australia or back in china ?
i 'm planning to return to china after graduation .
why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad .
well i think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment .
yes china 's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country .
of course ! it is the no . 1 <unk> in my life . you know job stress has become a very common problem these days . so we must learn to cope with it .
totally agree . what is your solution ?
well there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress both we and the companies should do something . for me i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know all work and no play make jack a dull boy .
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
but i don t think we can change our working condition . anyway we are not the bosses .
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
i think he did . he was too good to me . can you believe that ? i would n't be true .
it s not a bad idea . what a good thing to do . you know the phrase the corner the corner of the world .
no they had no reason for arresting me .
right so the deposit if i do n't draw on your deposit account i think the interest should be paid in the minimum deposit .
how about the senior account managers ? do they count ?
it s ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he 's very nice actually .
yes next march .
you mean the one starring john travolta ?
you mean on product availability reliability and price ?
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
grandma this is going to be my best friend and i 'll meet you at the beach too .
all right . make sure to be late .
go straight ahead is the traffic lights left there ?
it 's chilly outside so do n't forget to put on your jacket .
hmm . . . you look too dressed up . how about this purple top and these jeans ?
i know . i must get going .
is this the latest edition ?
it was a great meal . you should come here for your birthday .
would you like to pay for it ?
you are always so hospitable .
i 'm serious .
are you sure ?
ok . i 'll try the pink one .
yes . i think i 'll start to reduce the price by about 15 .
you 're a light weight .
i 'll take a front one .
in the diet i eat a lot of fat .
i m afraid i m not interested in fashion .
follow me into the kitchen . you will love it .
is that what you 're talking about ? i just ca n't stand it .
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
you don t have to . i have a friend who likes football and basketball .
i had a fantastic time .
of course . the wine list is very popular . and that makes the time to style out too .
i 'm afraid not .
come on i do n't know . but i would n't have the number to you . can you give her a call to me this afternoon ?
supervisor . open the door .
oh dear . i 'll send a memo to you .
sorry mum i 'll lock it right away .
of course sir . did you bring your id ?
have you got a temperature ?
why not ?
i would n't mind a burger .
fine . i ve been expecting something called a few days .
that sounds pretty good . how do you get that distance ?
oh come on !
yes it is .
what ? are you new at all ?
have n't even seen her ?
why do you think he needs to sell the cd ?
i thought we were all good at the high jump .
how about going to italy next summer vacation ?
good boy !
yep . i 'm so tired . you know i 'm ready for the parking lot .
yes . i have lost about ten kilos .
what dress size did you wear ?
sorry but he 's busy then too .
thanks . you are so considerate .
you should have called and let me know .
i like the plot . it 's very exciting .
i prefer summer especially the summer evenings . when the sun comes down it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . after a rain shower the smell of the air is refreshing . it is also a best reason for icecream .
how do you get through the stuffy daytime ?
well i have to hide in the airconditioned rooms . anyway it is all worth just think about the cool evening time .
fantastic ! i enjoy clubbing especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad full of smoke and the music is too loud so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
how did that happen ?
a wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . if i had drunk enough and i would have had the bold to punch him in the face .
sounds cool ! but that is not what a lady should do . people are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk .
oh that sounds great .
oh what s the problem ?
yes i know i will . and what about you ?
yeah .
do you know chinese better now ?
our school did . they played really well .
what was the score ?
the score was 10198 .
fantastic !
i 'm amy .
fine just fine . and you ?
not bad . it really is great to see you again . w here have you been ?
i 'm from new york . i do n't know but i do know where i should go .
better take the subway . it s faster and more convenient .
en where do we pay the fares ?
we have a rather comprehensive subway system here . you can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy .
where do we pay the fare ?
you have to pay it on the meter .
oh i see . how can i get the train ?
cash credit card or debit card ?
yes but you have to get off at the bank and take a no . 50 .
what 's the charge ?
yes . it is the fastest flight available to the airport .
is that so ? i did n't know it . can i possibly borrow a jacket and a tie ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't . but you will have to pay two sleeping fee .
then we 'll return to the hotel and come back will you change the appointment ?
certainly what time will you come back ?
at 7 please .
can i have your name and room number ?
a party of 13 .
are you married ?
er . . . hum . . . got it .
then open that window . yeah that one .
right !
i 'm getting a little short on cash . let 's just window shop a little .
i see what you mean . that was pretty easy after all .
no .
oh is it ? thank you anyway .
no problem .
he is a nice girl .
i just lost my job . my boss just told me .
that 's unbelievable . why did this happen ?
i do n't understand of myself . it seems they have to save money .
i cant't believe it . you 've worked here for years .
you 've got to have stayed in bed for ten minutes .
it 's no problem .
alright . there is one thing .
ok . let s go .
all right . but if you can t get me there now i ll be a lot of work .
i know but i 'm thinking of it .
i just don t want to play table tennis any more .
emm . . . yes . but i was n't too impressed . i found her a little stuck up .
you are kidding but she 's so helpful .
tom . . . you are her boss you down . of course she 's helpful to you .
come on . she 's like that with everyone .
i do n't think so actually . she never even says hello to me .
thank you . but a number of things have been going wrong lately .
that 's too bad . what problems are you having .
oh the whole house needs repainting for starters . the carpet in the living room is worn out and i 'd like to put in new walltowall carpeting . last week i had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . anyway all par for the course when you own a house i guess . i guess i am going to look the place over .
i 've studied home decoration as a hobby . could i make some suggestions ?
sure . there s a problem .
what s this sir ?
wow you really do have a talent for this alice . thanks for the suggestions .

i work in the small town .
ok then it 's probably the best season .
credit card .
i m taking a break from the moment . are you planning on buying a new apartment ?
tasha mountain ? it 's very famous in china is n't ?
an ordinary one .
my house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture .
no wonder you look so upset . have you called the police ?
yes i have . but i have to wait .
i know . are you keen on doing that ?
i need to get a costume for a fancy dress party and i reply do n't know what to get . will you come shopping with me ?
well an art isn t for a living of beijing . it s a great city to live in the city .
where are you going to be going ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
thanks . i 'll call you saturday morning .
it 's beautiful . enjoy it while it lasts . it 's supposed to get cold tomorrow .
what 's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
it 's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there 's a chance of freezing rain .
that does n't sound pretty .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
well i was going to drive to birmingham to see some friends .
you might want to change your plans . with the cold and wet weather that we 're supposed to have tomorrow the roads are going to be rather slippery .
i suppose i should . i do n't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
i just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
if you 're lucky it 'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !
if that happens then i 'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
that sounds like fun .
you ll have to buy your own ticket though .
english weather is even more predictable than i had previously thought .
no i 'm not . i just arrive a few minutes ago .
what are you doing ?
i 'm watching tv .
how old is he today ?
it 's his 50th birthday .
well wish him a happy birthday for me .
sure thing . what are your plans for the evening ?
i was just thinking of going to a movie tonight .
well if you can wait until tomorrow night i 'll go with you then .
sorry i 've got people coming over tomorrow night .
sounds like this weekend just is n't going to work out for us .
sounds that way . maybe some other time then ?
sure . hey i 'm sorry but i 've got to get going .
yeah me too . it 's about time i made a move .
you 'd better have it fixed .
likewise . see you later .
bye !
it 's beethoven . do you like it ?
not really . i 'm going to it . do you believe that you can get a lot of weight ?
i do n't know about that but i do think that it helps people relax .
what other kind of music do you listen to ?
actually i mostly just listen classical music . what about you ?
to be honest i think classical music is too complicated for me .
what kind of music do you prefer then ?
i like classical music . do you ?
not really . i like classical music better .
i see what you mean . i think that 's way i like it so much .
how long have you been in to pop music then ?
i 've always been into it . have you always liked classical music ?
not really . when i was little we did n't really listen to music at all .
so how did you become interested in it ?
well when i was about 10 years old i started playing the piano . i think that 's how it all started .
do you still play piano ?
yes it 's one of my hobbies .
what kind of movie is it ? i don t like many of his movies actually .
it s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead .
i like thrillers and i like julia roberts so it might be interesting . i read a review today and the critic didn t seem to be very impressed .
what did the critic say ?
he didn t say it was bad but he said that it wasn t as good as it could have been particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it .
the movie starts at eight o clock so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
good . dinner is nearly ready and i d like to watch the news before we go . the oscars were last night and i want to see the results .
i won t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . there were a few surprises .
i like current affairs programs and documentaries especially wildlife ones . how about you ?
i like those kinds of programs too . they re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
i agree . people often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence .
yeah . and that s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !
right . you can t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . they need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs .
i see . which platform should i go to the books ?
that s great idea . but don t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?
no . they don t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ?
not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! that s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv where you pay a fixed amount each month .
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country but people don t seem to keen to pay for their tv programs . besides the <unk> channels offer a good range of programs .
there s a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes . shall we ?
it s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . i play the part of the detective . he has to catch the killer but there s very little evidence . it s a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes but i hope audience won t be too scared to go to the movie theatres !
did you notice that he was a <unk> ?
i have had disagreement with every director . i ve worked with . we ve always <unk> in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . it was the same when i made this movie . i don t know where <unk> of my disagreement with rachel kelly come from . we got on very well and i hope to work with her again . i enjoyed making the movie very much . i enjoyed making the movie very much . i enjoyed making the movie very much .
well you have always been keen on photography . it s very useful for you to carry some programs .
not at all . the feedback from audience has been great . i care about what they think more than what the critics think .
did you do you own stunts in the movie ?
i wanted to but my insurance company wouldn t let me . all of my stunts were done by a <unk> . as you know i used to do my own stunts but i ll leave that to the experts in future .
thank you very much for doing this interview .
my pleasure . have you seen the movie yet ?
yes . i have . i liked it very much . like you i was very impressed with rachel s performance in the movie . she s going to be a star .
it was boring . just did my homework and practiced the piano .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
it s beautiful .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
yes i experienced one when i was in tokyo once . the tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over .
do you know where it measured on the richter scale ?
i do n't remember but it was n't very serious . have you ever been in an earthquake ?
no but i was in quite a few tornados when i was younger .
where are you from ?
i 'm on highway 175 going near exit 46 .
did your house ever get damaged from the winds ?
most of the time we were lucky but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room .
wow that must have really been scary .
actually some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass .
where are you from ?
no but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
that sure did n't last long !
ok .
what happened to him ?
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
was it his first offence ?
unfortunately not . he was charged with a <unk> when he was in university .
what happened to him then ?
not much it was a minor offence back then . he got away with a fine of 500 .
did they take his license away ?
no they were really easy on him . the problem is that that was a long time ago . they are much tougher on crime now .
what do you think will happen to him ?
well he 'll definitely lose his license pay a fine and maybe even spend some time in jail .
that does n't sound too promising . does he have a defence lawyer ?
not yet . if we ca n't find a lawyer for him then the state will appoint him with one .
my sister is a lawyer . i can ask her if she can help him .
that 'd be great ! i know he 'd appreciate your help .
i think housing is a big problem . there are thousands of homeless people on the streets .
how would you solve the problem ?
i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .
it would probably be very expensive .
i think the government can afford it . besides there are many advantages . homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement .
it s not a bad idea . i think the government should do it can to make a good impression .
if we are to invest more money to education we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn t be popular with voters .
most voters what everything bout ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things but without increasing taxes .
that s the point . all the employees need to pay for the bills .
yes it s the same every day we have . government has limited funds and must show that the government is comprehensive credit . if it companies don t want to exchange it for example .
it was fantastic .
how about you ?
well if i were you i would n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
yes . i have bought two pairs of each color .
ok . i 'll wait for those .
it is said that the past 2000 i 've had no idea . the fact that there is a lot of crime rate in their own country . i do n't think it can be any public transportation .
i think that i 've got a very good price . it seems that i have no problem for my own use .
i had no idea that i ran it .
two months are n't necessary but we are sure we can get a discount of 4 .
ok i 'll take one .
i think the government can earn a lot of money in the past few months . but it 's difficult for us to limit the amount of money .
but there are a lot of sites to share with their own energy . and the life stations are usually quite expensive .
i do n't know . maybe they have some good things .
yeah it 'll be a celebration next month .
i had a fantastic time . i got to go there once in a while .
well now we 're stuck . what can we do ?
yes i want to try it .
well it might be better if you told me you were going to drive an we could go to the beach in the summer .
yes . i 'll come back in two weeks .
why did n't you say so ?
it cost about 300 a month .
well now we 're stuck . what can we do ?
but i should have aced it . i mean i finished the paper so quickly thinking it 's a piece of cake . but when i knew my result i was like what ? that ca n't be true !
no how much is it ?
i know i should .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i 'm not sure yet .
what do you think about the rent ?
yes i have .
well you should come this weekend .
he 's the superintendent of this building .
there is a reality tv show about a group of people who are trying to lose weight .
well . . . i 'm not sure .
come on . let s go !
i ca n't wait to talk to you about it . i am sure you have a long story .
here you go honey fried eggs .
what 's it about ?
the one smoking a cigar .
and the <unk> ?
have you his number ?
i do n't like this kind as much . never mind the stopwatch then . i 'll take that other one . do you take checks ?
please wait a minute . i 'll see him .
no problem . what kind of job do you have ?
he 's the <unk> 's the little older . .
well then i guess i should go to the gym then .
what ?
i 've never had a game in a game before . it 's good to do anything .
if there 's one thing that bugs me it 's her critical attitude .
you wo n't lose it by the end of the week .
good idea . i 'm looking forward to it .
i wish it would cool off one day .
yes . we went there for a walk in the park .
good idea . i really want to go now .
good idea . i 'm really looking forward to it .
good question . i 'm afraid it 's not necessary for me to get used to the meeting .
ok .
would you like a drink ?
good question . i want to think about it .
i see . does that include the insurance ?
good question . i feel like sitting down with the garbage . i 'm a bit crazy .
but we should start our staff here .
the best way is to buy a new one .
i sure will . you know what the matter is .
you 're right . we can wait a few minutes . there s no problem with the tree to look out of the house .
i just don t know .
in other parts of the world especially in africa there is a problem with desertification . climate change and overfarming are causing farmland to turn into desert . in means that people cannot grow enough food .
i know what you mean . we can not see any behind a detailed report on the internet . there 's also a general concept that the proposal of business in the past .
i do n't think you are proficient in both written and spoken english . but not now .
well they 're on sale today for only 1 each .
i think it looks great . i could go and buy a new one .
i ca n't believe it . she was a psycho .
how about your spanish ?
okay . but i think we 'll get some exercise to go .
you 're lucky . he thought you had a cold .
good question . the company pays for everything .
i think it 's too expensive .
of course . but i 'm not sure if the color is on the right now .
well i could n't do that .
well me . i 'll go to the gym too .
no you do n't need to worry about that . i have a good exam tomorrow .
where is the peeler ?
i 'll teach you .
good idea . i have to think about it .
yeah but we saved a lot of money for the weekend . .
yes . i heard that there are a lot of people there .
hi linda . i have two concert complimentary tickets . will you go with me tonight ?
not bad . i m feeling very nervous . i ve been having trouble all day .
you speak english very well .
i 'm a tourist party .
what did you do there ?
i work very hard and that 's it you know . i am a fast learner so i can work overtime overtime .
that 's exactly what i want .
how do you get along with your colleagues ?
the problem is he seems to be out of town .
yeah . i have been in a need of of it for a while .
yeah . it 's the wedding anniversary of our weeding .
how did you get that ?
thank you . i 'm meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at twelve . would you care to join us ?
that 's good . i 'm usually more comfortable in my family .
how do you get married ?
oh i did n't . but a woman could n't find the income tax .
i know loads of people who ca n't stop eating the rest . there are plenty of golf courses around the country .
it 's hard to say . but i think it is pretty cheap for me .
he s a very good household cleaning . they re so lovely of you .
yes we 're always busy . but i 'm going to work hard .
oh come on . we 've already spent hours on the great time .
thank you .
i 'll do it .
well then may i have some beer ?
really ? that 's great !
that 's strange . she has a taste for success . and every time she 's small .
i do n't know . . . well i 'm sure she is though .
shall i leave a message ?
i met her later at the party .
all right . you are a smart person . what 's your favorite part ?
ok bond .
you 've got a lot of weight .
you 're welcome . goodbye .
i need to get a costume for a fancy dress party and i reply do n't know what to get . will you come shopping with me ?
yes even her mom .
come on sit down and let me have a look . hmm . . . pretty woman of the pan .
yes .
let 's see . if we have it it it should be over there under m . he looks through the cds . hmm it looks like we 've sold out of that one but we should be getting some more copies in soon .
i usually look at my computer and find the best information . sometimes i read it online . it s fun .
i 'm just kidding . i 'm just not online for this information . it 's not online to make anything it easier .
me too . i want to know more about you eg what 's your real name and what do you look like . .
that 's fine . i 'll go over there to have a try .
some friends of my parents .
oh no . um . . does it really a dark horse ?
the program is successful and it will make you a lot of money to open the future .
it has the new hairstyle of work . but it will take more time .
i got the time . it was almost eleven o 'clock in the morning .
what do you do for work ?
i do n't know . i feel sick and tired .
now i have it i told you about it i 'm in the car .
it 's a job at a recruitment agency .
i m afraid we have n't decided yet .
yes but i 'm going to quit the job and have to pay for it .
right i see . if you can give us a few days off after a business trip i 'll go with you on that right ?
thanks for the talk . i 'm looking forward to seeing you !
you wo n't be late . i have to get up early tomorrow .
thanks . you 're welcome . have a good sleep .
i like to play the piano go shopping .
there 's nothing to watch right now .
it 's certainly a simple movie . you can read the local news in the movies .
i like all sorts of movies primarily drama and science fiction .
well it 's not a good deal . it 's about the safety of the company . and there 's only a million dollars for one person .
do n't you think it 's too bloody ?
now what do you think of this one ? it 's a very good piece of cake .
i hope you enjoy life in the library .
i go to the it often . i go to bed for about an hour at least .
true . i like the film more .
it 's a movie theater .
well that 'll be great . i 'll give you a try .
sure . it is a most popular dish .
but if a passenger ca n't come on a date is out i would n't be afraid . i 've got to fly for a good location .
there 's no need . you can ask the accountant or the lawyer of the company .
is it a horror movie ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
hey how would you like to taste my fist ?
alright all joking aside what kinds of moves do you like ?
um let me see romance comedy . documentary action science fiction animated and so on .
that is to say you like all <unk> except for horror movies .
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
the notebook is this type of movie .
really ? i have n't heard of it .
well then this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . i bet you 'd love it .
ok . i ca n't wait to see it . let 's go !
i had a drop too much last night . i attended a banquet given by a chinese colleague of mine . and it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a chinese table .
you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or wouldbe friends is a way of solidifying friendship especially in northern china .
i just felt embarrassed if i refused to drink when people toasted to me . but if i keep gulping down one cup after another i 'm afraid i would feel unfit or sick .
you lose face by refusing to drink and the host might think you refuse to give him face . the right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . this will endear you to your friends .
a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night crying hoarsely and <unk> whole heaps of nonsense that i never understood .
then he must be opening his heart to the friends . in a word as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort no one will <unk> at you .
i got you . next time i 'll <unk> a toast with a statement like i ca n't drink any more and then drink anyway .
really ? where did you hear that ?
i met with the supervisor just this morning . i do n't know but i am a little worried . who do you think will get sacked ?
i 'm not sure . . . well first it could n't be george . he is such a <unk> . he 'd wash the boss 's dog if he asked .
no it 's not going to be george . i do n't think it 's andy either . he is involved with the boss 's sister inlaw . and you know how whipped our boss is .
that 's true . what about lisa ? i bet there 's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
lisa ? no way . i 've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . you know rumors ca n't come out from nowhere .
well okay . then there is still michael . but he 's the boss pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . it definitely wo n't be michael .
no that would be crazy . but then who will it be ? oh dear it must be me . i should have known it ! why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . what should i do ? i 've got a family to support .
well it could be me too . but i am not too worried . this place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hardass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . it would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place .
it 's very nice . i have n't heard live music in a while . this is fun .
well then may i invite you for the next dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
you 're not a dancer .
you 're dancing so well .
you dance beautifully too .
thank you . it 's lucky that i have got a good partner .
in college . but i do n't dance very often . what 's your favourite dance ?
it 's hard to say . it depends . but i love the waltz .
how about tango ?
oh i like it . it 's such a beautiful dance but i ca n't do it well . what about you ?
tango is my favorite . anything but <unk> or the foxtrot . the music has stopped
thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
yes it 's not like what the radio said at all .
what would you like for a drink ?
i think so . it was about 20 degrees below zero and i feel a little feverish .
it 's too large . do you think it 's possible to get a change ?
it 's fine with me . the weather is good .
how can the weather be happening ?
it must be very pleasant . the weather is so warm . why do n't you go with us ? i 'd like to take a rest .
let 's get started . you know what the weather will be like tomorrow .
we may go abroad . i m not sure . my wife is very good .
do you have any family here ?
fine thank you . i m leaving tomorrow morning .
i m sure we ll have a great time .
when ?
yes . but i ended up with a girl who played a girl who was n't all my dead enough .
it sounds not bad .
the one that stole a small plane ?
i think the red somewhere in the yard sale are quite new . do you think the red ones ?
i am so glad that i could be a little sad .
i know . but you have to be an experienced one .
he did n't even mention it ! i had an appointment with mr . thomas to be in charge of the office .
i love you happy anniversary .
i do n't know . i think it 's probably the job .
well i think you 'd better send an email to tell him .
i know . but it 's pity for me to lose such a good neighbour .
what 's it ?
yes i am .
do you have any ideas ?
he has wear a tie .
yes i will find the one for you .
yes . i can t think of anything .
yes that 's right . you can change your job down the internet .
exactly what time does it start ?
of course yes . the one you have now is the latest fashion .
look at my cell phone . i can listen to music watch movies take pictures play games surf the web and download documents . it 's just like a pad .
no . it s necessary for me to wear a pair of casual dress and tie .
so what 's that ? do n't tell me you got it .
what 's the matter ?
i can t agree with you more . tell me more details about him .
sure . a ufo is just a space vehicle from another planet . if you think about it our space <unk> are ufos .
i 've never thought about it like that before .
i 've seen photos of ufos in america before but they 've all looked doctored up .
do you think that there 's life on other planets ?
i think there must be .
why is that ?
because men like to cheat .
do you think that there 's intelligent life trying to contact us ?
no but we 're trying to contact them .
i suppose you 're right .
i think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet <unk> will not become extinct .
do you really think that global warming wil destroy earth some day ?
there 's a lot of evidence that suggest it will but i do n't think it 's going to happen any time soon .
you 're a little <unk> . i 'm through the boxes with those who are n't you ?
france ? no i m single . he s never dated a girl .
what a great idea !
what 's the problem ?
ok no problem .
i know . but he s my style .
it was boring . just did my homework and practiced the piano .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
it s beautiful .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
let me see . that one goes for 17 .
would you take 12 ?
no i can t give you an injection . let me check it for you .
13 . 50 ?
sorry 14 is the lowest i can go .
i like ferris wheel more .
yes i know what you mean . we have a lot of clients in the place . but first you 'd like to see it .
well it s just about luck .
really ? then i guess i won t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
actually you might because there s a big convention in town this weekend .
i m not too worried about it . i always seem to find something .
let me check . oh ! it s at 325 .
wow that 's cutting it close ! that means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! what gate is it at ?
it 's at . . . gate 14 .
oh good . that s the number where i catch the park .
here s the plan when you are here . give me the call and let s go !
be careful ! oh sara !
i main market reasearch and you ?
you know i think you re right . i ll go and get the drink .
it s a very cool job .
ok . let s go and get a drink .
i work in the banking industry .
yes we do .
excuse me but can you bring me a copy of the ordinary ones ?
what can i do for you today ?
read me the index number !
well they are pretty but they are different . . .
what did you do that ?
because you can see the stars perfectly .
that s interesting . and what did you do there ?
i would say that but i am not really sure if i can get a hold of them .
it 's inevitable . their love wasbuilt on the sand and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks .
the department manager is all over her .
i ca n't believe it . how much is that ?
we went to europe .
yeah .
not yet . i am still looking through the classifieds . wish me luck .
how so ?
i am not sure . i think it 's time to get used to it .
you said it .
six years .
that 's a long time .
i 'm not sure . he s very tall and handsome .
i hope so too .
as you know china has a singlechild policy . therefore there s just my husband my daughter and i . what about in your family ?
i have a large family . i have three older sisters my twin sister a younger brother and parents .
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
we 're not exactly the same but we have a complete control of our products . we are complete opposites when it comes to everything else .
interesting . it must be great having a twin sister . are you best friends too ?
we used to be really close but that all changed once she moved to shanghai . how about your family ? you didn t mention to your biological father .
i do n't know much about him . he died when i was a baby .
what about your stepbrother 's mother ? does he keep in touch with her ?
she also believes in healthy diet . and she requires us to have regular meals .
sounds like it was meant to be .
sure it was the first round round the world . we had a big talk about it . then we went to the right place .
well you 're going to do great .
oh do n't be silly forget it .
it 's very interesting .
oh i thought he only liked his language skills .
a wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . if i had drunk enough and i would have had the bold to punch him in the face .
did the cops find out why he flew into the u . s . ?
he 's a captain .
why do n't i call a little ? he 'll be very glad .
he was wearing a mask over his face .
well i bet he 's really a very serious person .
he 's probably got a job and now he 's coming .
i was born in beijing but i came back from america .
well i had no idea that .
i had a pretty strict upbringing and my parents taught at an university so they have extremely high expectations for me .
well there s no problem . we can t handle it but you should have told me .
no they 're always talk to them about their new teacher .
how can these be ended in a relaxed manner ?
i studied at anshan university .
oh i thought you were making some courses .
i am a journalist . i write for china daily .
oh you didn t know that much about american universities . that s wonderful !
seriously i am so excited .
i see . do you want to do your english ?
well i got a lot of friends and learning english .
i see . and anything else ?
i m going to the cinema dad .
i know . they are used to be used for all sorts of animals and <unk> . i think they ll do them in their field .
my husband and i have thought about it but we ve decided not to have any . they are just too expensive . besides with all the news about global warming on the news lately who knows what kind of world we ll have in the future . what about you ?
well i have to say that . what 's your family like ?
i was planning to get a big pet that would live with a lot of fun . but now you see what i did to do . i do n't want to live with people .
well you can always give me an option of how many kids do you have to stay in the house then ?
yes that would be great .
so if there is anything else i can do to help you with it ?
that 's true . but as a woman i can see that there will be a problem for me . i can t imagine how many people there would be in your country .
one is a little bit crazy . you should give up too many chances in your life .
i don t know what other people think but i for one envy only children !
that sounds great . i 'm absolutely starving ! what kind of food are you in the mood for ?
i 'd love something spicy . maybe we could get some sichuan hotpot .
you are a woman after my own heart . i do n't know many people who can handle spicy food . are you sure you are up for hot pot ?
you are a woman after my own heart . i do n't know many people who can handle spicy food . are you sure you are up for hot pot ?
you are a woman after my own heart . i do n't know many people who can handle my temper . are you sure you are up for hot pot ?
well let 's stop dragging our feet and find a sichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner !
it 's a little bit difficult to do whatever let 's make a little time . i know we 'll be back soon .
well . . . ? have you thought of it yet ?
no . . .
i 'll have to write you a ticket and <unk> your vehicle .
that 's it ! that s the one i was thinking of ! i told you i 'd remember it !
you really have a big head do n't you .
i m not sure but probably about 75 years . how about in your country ?
well it 's about 70 i think . it would be a little too small for me to buy a small stock .
i heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .
perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
did she ? that s great . however if we have too many children that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .
i do n't think so .
oh he 's been out of work for a couple of days .
he 's a senator now .
i had mine when i was 24 . that 's a little young . i d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .
yes i think you 're right . i 'll need a credit card and a visa .
sure . you can fully enjoy your time together .
yes there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out have fun and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discourage them but they don t often succeed .
you might be right . i know there are many kids but my parents want to be like them .
it s almost impossible to get the right balance . if you are too strict kids might ignore you . if you are too lenient they might go wild .
what did you argue about ?
he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back . he said he didn t have the money yet .
well he should pay you back . it s only fair .
yes but i got angry with him too quickly . he probably thought that i <unk> him . i shouldn t have got angry .
did you lend him a lot of money ?
not much . i had to pay an unexpected bill so i needed the money back .
well talk to him about it next time you see him . he probably feels as bad about it as you do . close friends sometimes have disagreements . it s nothing unusual . neither of you said anything really nasty did you ?
i guess you re right . i m sure we should patch things up .
of course you should . you wouldn t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship would you ?
i m not sure . i guess i d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time .
you usually go to the supermarket . it s always good for your health .
i think you re right . i m going to have to cut out all the evidence .
i m sorry to hear that . i think you re right .
i will . you must be lonely .
yes it s always so horrible .
i know . i just talked to alex s best . what do you think we should do ?
you are right . maybe that s why it is so important to make a good impression . but i think pink is the best for them . if you are always in public speaking you will be in support them .
yes i know that . but our business is great . we have n't established seats in the world . and i think that 's the world we should n't have a big deal with .
i just make eye contact with him and nod my head . then i tell him when he comes over to the table . why do you ask ?
i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
that seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .
that s what i thought . i just thought i d ask you and see what you thought of it . anyway what did you do yesterday evening ?
well it was a warm evening so i stretched my legs . i walked along the canal for a couple of miles . actually several other people had the same idea . i saw bill .
did you ? how is he these days ?
he seemed ok . we didn t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . we just waved at each other .
i need to move some furniture . could you help me to lift it ?
of course . what do you want to move first ?
let s move the sofa . can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? i ll lift this end . i want to move it sideways in that direction .
no not very much . he s too ambitious and dishonest .
oh i agree . i like his brother paul . they are not alike .
yes . they are completely different . paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother .
what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?
i think i m polite careful relaxed and shy .
oh i do n't think you 're shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party .
well . yes but those people always start talking to me . i never talk to them first . perhaps i 'm not as shy as i think . anyway you 're certainly not shy !
you 're right . i love going out and making new friends .
so you 'll be at my birthday party on friday ?
of course !
i wouldn t miss it for the world ! it s sure to be fun . she s invited a lot of people . do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ?
if everyone turned up it would be a squeeze but a few people said that they couldn t go so i think it should be ok ?
are you taking anything ?
i ve got her a birthday present and i ll take a bottle fo wine too .
that s a good idea . she told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . i think it s going to be a noisy party . i hope her neighbours don t mind too much .
so you re in love with large portions . what did you think of a party ?
i m so sorry to hear that . what did you do there ?
well don t be late . i ll see you on friday at helen s .
it certainly was a pleasure . it s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here .
i expected that something might get broken . that doesn t bother me . that spilled drink won t leave a stain will it ?
i doubt it i 'll deal with it right away . luckily it wasn t a glass of red wine i ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth .
i m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag .
afterwards we can do the washing up together . everything will be finished within an hour . your friend keith is really funny . i liked his magic tricks .
yes he s very good . . isn t he ? he told some funny stories too .
amanda told some very funny jokes . at the beginning of the party she was being very serious .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
what did you put in that punch ? it tasted great but was quite strong .
that s my little secret . did you like the snacks that i prepared ?
very much . the birthday cake was delicious wasn t it ? emily told me that she and karen made it themselves .
that cake tasted so good ! it disappeared within minutes so i think everyone liked it a lot . how s that stain ?
all right . i ll just have it finished . are you ready to start on the washing up ?
well first of all it s much bigger . it has the same number of rooms but each room is larger . we also have a larger garden which our dog loves of course !
so it s a threebedrooms detached house ?
yes . one bedroom is for my wife and i . there s another for our daughter . my wife wants to use the third one as a guest room but i d like to make it into a study . our daughter is also keen on making it a study so that s probably what will happen .
what s the kitchen like ? i know both you and your wife like to cook .
that s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . the kitchen and dining room are together . it s really large .
are the rooms nice and bright ?
yes they are . that s very important to us . we like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . each room has large windows .
do you have a balcony ?
no we don t . we wish we had one . that s the only thing we wanted but don t have . the area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly .
you re right on the edge of the city aren t you ? there can t be much noise or traffic there . is it easy to get into city centre ?
it s a very quiet neighbourhood . there s some traffic but not much . it s not very difficult to get to the city centre but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ll get lost . so when are you going to drop by ?
that s very nice of you . the counselor is a psychologist . he s better trained to handle these things .
that s clever ! then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there s no chance of two people buying the same gift . what things were in the notebook ?
most of the things were household appliance . you know everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . i think it s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home .
so what did you get them ?
i bought a sewing machine . i know that my friend likes making her own clothes but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems .
what s wrong with it ?
my daughter s just banged up her knee pretty badly and i m going to have to take her to the hospital . i ll be about two hours late .
household appliance don t seem to last for a long time nowadays .
i think it s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . because they know that we will buy the new models the appliances don t need to last more than five or ten years at most .
not really . i like looking on the internet at what s available but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i m buying before i pay for it . sometimes i ll look at something in a shop but later buy it online if it s cheaper . you don t like buying things online do you ?
the internet s a lot of money to do . i don t think the internet is as well as important as your money is at least fifteen dollars a month .
not really . i know that it happens but if you buy from <unk> companies with secure websites you should be ok . even though i use online shopping facilities i don t think it s the best way to shop .
i m surprised to hear you say that . i thought you loved anything technological .
i do . i m a big fan of using new technology but i don t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . i think people need to get out and interact with other people .
so how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
sure . i d love to join you . can we stop by the computer store ? i just want to see if they have something .
sure . while you re in the computer store . i will visit the book store opposite . i like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting .
ok . i ve finished online . let s go . i ll just get some money and my credit card .
thanks for reminding me . i had forgotten to get mine .
i got my information and my portable tv .
so you 'll be at my house by then ?
thanks you too !

i hope so . but i 'm going to the gym .
what 's the weather going to be like ?
you 're right . we do n't know what is going to be like tomorrow .
i know . i do n't want to get sick especially during finals week .
it does n't matter . i will be back tomorrow .
i am sorry to hear that . what are we going to do now ?
that 's exactly what i want .
i wanted to go with you . but i do n't know what to do with it .
i ca n't wait to play my legs .
i think it might rain .
i 'm happy to hear that .
you 'd better take a bath .
oh really ? i 'm so sorry .
you 're right . we do n't know what is going to be like tomorrow .
i am going to the beach this weekend .
the weather is so unpredictable this time of year .
that will be great .
you see . i 've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite .
i 'm doing ok . thanks for asking .

i 've invited you to a dinner party at the restaurant .
thank you .
i 'm still sick .

my friend and i was argued with each other . for this i 'm very sad .
i 'll bet he was n't too upset .
it 's ok now . do n't worry john .
i want to go to see a movie this weekend .
no . that 's all i have to do .
i see . do you need someone to come home ?
i am going to be ok .

instead of walking . you can take this shuttle to get you there faster .
do you think the plane will leave without me ?
no i 'll call the attendants at the gate to tell them that you are on your way .
thank you so much . i really appreciate that .
do n't worry about it .
i m all right thanks .
i 'm doing a shopping party .
how much is it for my hair ?
i 've got my own idea .
actually it 's a great place .
how do you like your job ?
i m going to register at the university .

no . it was very crowded there .
i would like to catch a movie this weekend . it 's not a bit hotter than the summer .
no thank you . i 'm just browsing today .
i 'm going to have to write you a ticket .
and only that does n't make a perfect one you also have to pay attention to the format of the report .
well . i 've got a small percentage of beijing city life here .
do you think i could take a bus to get there ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
yes i like the house . but it is of course course course and it 's the best season to take place .
registration plus overnight . . .
that 's a bit more than i wanted to pay . can you cut the price down a bit ?
thank you .
very good . here is your laundry .
well all right . i will be there .
i see .
of course . but i am afraid you will be more comfortable than your flight .
the service here is huge .
an attendant will pass the bag and get a bag ready for you .
where is the fitting room ?
it s about three hours .
an ordinary return is ten hours .
i 'm so sorry to hear that .
it 's for a purse that cost 350 .
you need to pay some small additional fare to keep the account .
i was just there a couple of days ago . you know you should go down there too . they have a lot of stylish clothes on sale .
how have you been feeling this way ?

i think it was too cold and i 'm told the waiter that i could n't get it .
i know what you mean . i think the problem is that it was not created by the burglar .
credit card . we do n't like it .

that is a great view .

when was the palace built ?
i 'll pick you up here tomorrow .
you can say that again ! it 's much more modern than people imagine .
where can we get off ?
nearby ! why are you acting so weird ?
stop getting on the bus . it 's faster and more convenient .
did you have a good time ?
if we do n't move our car we will use the same beach in the morning .
that 's it .
yup an important role in british history . women have often played an important role in africa .

i m sure you re right . i m looking forward to seeing them on the 17th .
we do n't have a swimming pool but a swim stations are about 1000 meters away .
i think you re right . i m going to get a load of it .
it s pretty good . i ve got a small one that s easy to make . thanks .
that s wonderful . we can take the room to make sure there s been a good one .
no i have no complaints . i hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company . is that true ?
really ? are you sure you can be more considerate ?
i m not worried about the name of the film but i couldn t help it .
you mean the card they re not <unk> ?
yes there was a problem with your delivery .
what are we going to do ?
hmm . i 'll tell my wife and i 'll get to work on it .

it s about six or seven miles . that s about the kilometers .
that sounds ok . so we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall .
right . then we turn left and walk up this small hill . the view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . we can eat a snack there .
then we will follow this path down the hill to the old church .
we can spend a few minutes looking around the church . then we turn right and walk along this path .
this path leads to the cave . can we look inside the cave ?
yes we can but it isn t very interesting .
then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path .

the most important thing i need to check the price .
yes one more thing . and one moment please .
i think this job is not common in this market . you have to carry on with copies of the newspaper .

i 'd like to book a room for this evening .
what kind of room would you like ma am ? we got single rooms double rooms standard rooms standard rooms standard rooms standard rooms standard rooms standard rooms double rooms standard rooms standard rooms standard rooms standard rooms standard rooms suites and deluxe suites . french and presidential styles which one would you like to go to ?
a single room with a bath if possible .
thank you .
great ! my name is jenkins .
but what can i do for my job ?
that 's great . i 'm going to take the 20 days off .
it was nice to meet you too .
it 's ok .
yes here you go .
do you have a copy of the id card ?
yes i d like to check three pieces .
i m sorry sir . airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage at twenty kilograms each plus one piece of carryon luggage . i will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase .
what ? why ! i am taking an intercontinental flight ! i m flying sixteen thousand cms ! how am i supposed to only take two twenty kilo bags ? that s absurd !
i am sorry sir there s nothing i can do . you cannot board the flight with that large bag either . carry on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat . that bag is clearly too big .
now i see . you charge next to nothing for an international ticket but when it comes to charging for any other small thing you charge an arm and a leg ! so tell me miss how much will i have to pay for all of this .
let s see . . . six hundred and twentyfive us dollars .
that s more than my roundtrip ticket !
where are we going ?
hope we have good luck .
yes it is . are you in a hurry sir ?
i 'm planning to travel to europe next year . i 'd like to go to beijing and have a good time .
well you 'll still have to do some shopping on these two things .

did you have a good time ?
thanks for all your help .
we 've just started doing the floor . i hope you can help me .
you ca n't do that ! you ca n't charge me for a mistake that you made !
no .
how much is the service charge ?
i tried a couple of times but i could n't bear .
i 'm afraid i can t . i 'm a bit short .
well it depends on how many pounds you would like .
you do n't want to get her with her name .
that 's great . i do n't want to be cooped up in my own hotel .
yes it 's not too bad . besides i like to meeting new people .
that 's a great idea . she likes hot food and sichuan food .
sure we do !
ok ! what about the place ?
she deserves nothing but the best of course .

i think so .
just the champagne will be fine .
i 'm glad you came .
yes .
i would like to know the problem with your daughter .

i 'm very sorry . sir . i 'll have to get a refund for you .
why ? i have a guest ticket .
all right . please make sure to be late .
i 'm glad to hear that .
what do you do ? how many hours are we talking about ?
i 'm going to need to go to that cafe .
it 's 530 by the way . i 'll be waiting for you .
oh i 'm so sorry . sir i 'll give you another room .
you are such a neat freak ! i am always wanted to see that myself !
okay i 'll get it for you .
that s very specialized . so the insects and the flowers rely on each other .
i 'll take care of the order . but i 'm glad you 're enjoying your trip .
if you tell me the exact problem i can be more helpful .
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh no are they back ? i 'll give you another room immediately sir and a refund for tonight .
thank you .
i 'm glad you 're here . you 're welcome to our general manager . i 'd like to know what they have .
i 'll need to take that up .
i 'm just browsing . i 'm taking a nonsmoking room with a bathroom .
oh sorry . but we wo n't .
yes i 'm not . i just bought them last week .
all right . i 'll take them .
do i have to pay extra charge for the gym ?
what are you doing ?
i see . sir what seems to be the problem ?
i feel sorry for the inconvenience .
i think we 'll get invited .
thank you . we 'll certainly have to discuss your work with our director .
do n't mention it .
you do n't need to swim stations .
i 'm glad to hear that .
no i do n't think so .
i use the hard smell . i have a lot of fruit and a lot of songs .
three yuan .
excellent ! now what are the hours ?
the gym is open on the ground at 12 thirty a . m . to 10 p . m .
do i have to pay extra charge for that ?
you do n't need to worry about what you are going to do with it .
you do n't need a swim stations . it 's worth reading .
i 'm glad to hear that . what are the hours ?
that 's fine sir .
that sounds really neat . is there an extra charge for these swim stations ?
we do have a pool but you wo n't have to pay a little extra .
fantastic ! what are the hours ?
it 's hard to say . it depends on the radio and beef .
good . thank you .
you might like to swim in the swimming pool . it 's a great place to sit in the back .
could i see your id please sir ?
here you are .
thank you . ah ! but this is in french . would you mind giving me the english menu ?
sure . how about you ?
i 'm sorry mr . sandals but we accept only mastercard or visa .
all right . here 's my visa .
now if you 'll just sign here please .
yes that 's just what i wanted .
i think it s going to be an important thing .
thank you for your information .
five days .
how long will it take to get to 82nd street ?
i think it is of the very difficult period to deal with . we 'd like to but we cannot exceed the agreement on the certificates you know .
ok i have no idea . you know we are an excellent candy shop .
i fully understand your position . an irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time . but on the other hand it would add to the buying costs . we 've been after all trading partners for 3 years and you know us well . ca n't you give us d a or d p ?
well it 's not a simple thing . i suppose we can go for this service . it 's easy to get online .
ah i see . . well i 'm afraid there has n't been a problem for a long time . and i 'd like to change our contract into my current account .
but the bank will add to the l c 's account and the money to be paid in cash or a year .
let 's see . roll up your prescription please .
but i ca n't miss it . it 's been a long time .
yes . right here .
will the bank open on on september 10th ?
it is going to be a little cholesterol .
i 'd like to .
it might be but for a while i also want you to have a try .
what about the other drugs ? can you think it s healthy ?
if you do n't like that then you wo n't have to pay for fine .
no your prescription is out of the hospital . you can have the money for a new one .
i hope you have some good wine .
i am really sorry .
yeah we are getting along well .
it will be a little but for a while i also want you to take your drug lisinopril an ace inhibitor .
why ?
yes please . i 'm going to let you go over to the hospital . how about that one ?
yeah i ve been having a lot of mood lately .
you may have a little bit of a dry cough but you will feel much better .
of course . what can i do for you ?
i asked for a nonsmoking room and i do n't have one . my room smells like cigarette smoke . i ca n't stand it . could you change my room please ?
the best product is <unk> and you can buy either the lotion or cream .
what kind of software do you use ?
i d like to try the new hairstyle . could you make it fit me in both ?
i heard it 's so exciting .
you could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker .
i appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching .
do n't mention it .
let 's see . okay so 50 <unk> of prozac would you prefer this in capsule or tablet ?
i like you .
i am afraid there is no room for any problems .
can i make an appointment right now ?
i am going to put a tourniquet on your arm to bring you an ace inhibitor lisinopril .
thank you very much . i 'll take the two .
i 'm afraid you can t .
ok . i will .
there will be an excellent one on the ground .
ok .
have you had any type of cold lately ?
for about 2 years .
well i guess i m going to move out to higher .
i ve been getting a little worse . the doctor gave me some chocolate cake and i ordered a little cheese for my family .
what did he aim at ?
i usually try to keep them in the kitchen . if i don t have to worry about them i ll go to the supermarket .
does it bother you when you eat something really cold ?
i do n't know . i 'll wear a little different .
with pleasure . when you are ready to go do the job you should have some details with your questions you .
i want to get some details about my company .
how long have you had it ?
could you tell me some more ?
no the other one has some .
well for a site like ecrush . com since their debut in valentine 's day in 1999 of the 1 . 5 million people who have joined ecrush . com 300000 have actually matched .
you could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker .
i appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching .
when did you get your fantastic marks ?
i ve been getting really short of breath and my coach wanted to have a doctor check me out .
let me help you with it .
i have been feeling a little lightheaded lately .
did you have a fight with your wife ?
no i have n't .
no problem ! also i would like to have some stirfried <unk> and steamed shrimps .
i 'm going to quit my job . the gym only around here is about a little more .
you 've got a lot of weight .
yes i do . i like it too .
just the tests like that they are wearing what i want .
what should i do after that ?
i recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . it may offer you many benefits . first it 's good for your health . i 'm afraid it 's not necessary for me to further elaborate . while lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising a bike ride to work not only <unk> you up but also
is that the one that i 've been having ?
i wish you would . but i 'm afraid it 's not too much of a problem .
i know . i 'm going to good through this as much as i can .
yes . . . . a bit . . . ouch !
and have a great day !
i have n't the slightest idea .
what s the matter ?
that 's it .
thanks doc . i ve got a really bad toothache ! i can t eat anything and look my face is all swollen . i think it might be my wisdom tooth .
well let s have a look . open wide . hmm . . this doesn t look good . well it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . we ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse and the crown probably needs to be refitted . i m going to order some xrays .
is it gonna hurt ?
no not at all ! just lay back and relax .
what are they ?
yes the pain comes more intense when the weather is bad . and the pain comes more intense when i walk too much .
have you ever had any trauma ?
yes i have .
you have never missed an assignment beforewhen will you be making this one up ?
yes it does . just like a needle prick . besides the place that hurts often feels cold too .
do you have the sensation of ants crawling over the painful part ?
yes i do .
you shall go to the school 's sports center .
by the way does acupuncture hurt ?
acupuncture may cause just a little pain but it also causes a certain feeling of numbness and distension . we ll try it every day for seven days . will that be all right ?
yes . let 's start today .
that 's good to hear . you 've had an ideal recovery from your operation . we 're going to send you home tomorrow .
do you think i can get back to work very soon ?
do n't be in such a hurry . i 'm confident that you 'll be completely recovered in 4 to 6 weeks .
is there anything i should do ?
no nothing . it 's thoughtful of you to call me again .
should i take some medicine ?
yes . i 'm going to give you some . take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . for that one two tablets . and remember to come to the out patient department for a consultation in two weeks please .
it 's very kind of you .
do n't mention it . it was the least i could do .
let me see . roll up your sleeve please . um . . it 's swollen and red here . i 'm afraid we 'll need to take an xray to see if it 's broken .
what if it 's broken ?
then we 'll put you in a cast .
wonderful ! how much is the ticket ?
it 's hard to say . but i do n't think i can afford it .
when did you last time have your eyes checked ?
two years ago . at that time i had no problems . now i can t even make out something ten meters away .
come over here . i will test your eyes . first cover your left eye like this and when i point please read the chart from the top and go as far as you can telling me which way the e points .
all right .
i will take the tapestry the set of table wear and the vase .
well this one is worse .
never mind just read as far as you can .
i can only read the first three lines .
what 's the matter ?
pardon ?
where can i help you ?
well it 's the 11th avenue park street .
no there 's no charge .
all right it 's all over . there is a lot of noise outside and the sky are spicy . can you make the whole time for me to change my skin ?
not long . they 'll be ready in a few minutes .
i guess you are right . but what will you do if you think of the clothes you are n't going to lose weight ?
yes it is .
i 'll try . anyway .
that 's pretty bad .
yes two of them have dancing figures .
look there are still one thing that you can do . all you have to do is sign up and date the most of your computer information .
ladies are registered .
consider yourself lucky .
i like everything with my boyfriend .
i see . what kind of seafood do you want ?
oh no . it 's easy . my <unk> will teach you .
i believe that the most important thing is the nature of the job .
my roommate always brings a lot of friends from <unk> . they stay in the room until midnight singing and talking drinking and playing cards while i have no place for study . i even do n't have the quietness to sleep .
how long have you had it ?
not yet . at least have one more question .
you see that means when anything is up for renewal we do it automatically and you do n't have to physically come here to sort it out . all you need to do is sign here and we 'll set it all up for you .
3 months .
well . you should know that this is a capable time for you .
i 'm not feeling very well .
i doubt what you eat .
yes and i 'm cold .
what 's your favorite dance ?
no constipation .
you should do it .
how long will it take ?
yes i 'm serious .
i need a hand with the fax machine .
hey . i just played basketball earlier so my legs are a little sore . let 's work out on arms and stomach today .
not too bad . it was terrible . i 'm sorry .
that 's a good idea .
no honey i was too tired .
do you want to go see a movie ?
yes of course .
that 's all . you need to do is to take your picture with you .
well i guess you 're right . i just ca n't seem to have the same problem .
this sweater is so pretty . i love the low neck design .
well . . . i 've never heard of a few friends who are n't there .
i 've got a fever and a bad headache .
have you any aches and pains ?
i ve had my first time .
that 's the reason why you ask for the rest of the family .
ah .
yes it does look a bit sore . let 's take your extra way of your chest and give you a few tests .
is it serious ?
there are a lot of open houses this weekend . why do n't you go there ?
yes i never seem to have any energy .
oh that 's not too bad . anything else ?
no it is not serious .
then shall we meet at the movie theater ?
all right then . i 'll go together with you .
i do n't understand . and we have no choice . i 'm sure our cooperation will be favorable .
thank you for the invitation . we will have an wonderful time to go .
i 'm afraid not . i 've been here before . it 's not difficult .
how long does the tour take ?
i have no idea .
how long have you been working with this company ?
i would like to take a few days off .
that s good . which flight do you get per day ?
maybe you should try to lose weight .
i see .
i think i 'll pay by card .
if you were n't able to take a picture you would n't do that .
i don t think so . as long as i have this job is an important growth opportunity for me . i have no idea how to use my current job and invest my money somehow .
oh i see . so the workers will be driving a day for all the workers .
yes . may i help you ?
thank you for telling me that .
i 'll try to not to give up .
that s great . let s begin as soon as i see each other .
three .
that 's good . and are they going to get married in the personnel market ?
the same thing is that most of the employees are afraid to take care of this .
so what was the most important thing you have learned at work ?
any of them are <unk> .
but we still need some money to live .
that 's a big change .
yes . i 'd like to book a single room .
just a moment please . i 'll check for you . sorry i 'm afraid there is no ticket available on that day .
as soon as possible .
that 's fine .
er . . . is there any direct seat ?
ok . we 'll have a room available right away .
thank you .
i see . all these are different dim sum dishes . you can have a double room without <unk> .
i m sure i can do it .
i 'd like to try some kebab roasted squid and many different appealing things .
what s the least least expensive ?
i hope so . we 've invited one of our best friends .
ok . my wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now . i am leaving .
yes of course . that 's quite an important point isn t it ? as a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150000 hk dollars per annum . this doesn t include a generous housing allowance al
yes that 's right . as to me i am applying for a company that is the corporate philosophy like yours .
i m voting for the best .

i must meet someone at the airport tomorrow afternoon .
automatics are very simple to drive .

that 's right .
you 're very kind to say so . when will the tour take a series of products then ?
ok . but the card is too large .
that sounds nice . i 'll take some .
i 'm afraid i have n't got any of them . they are all in different colors .
are you serious ? what if i do n't have the money to buy a ticket ?
the best we can do is to lower the price by the end of the week .
i think i m more interested in a thai market . it is more important to take .
of course the most important thing is that you are interested in . the prices of the ornaments have been well prepared for five years . you can provide more superior quality for the goods .
very good . thank you very much .
thank you . goodbye .
by the way what s the matter ?
oh look at it 's not your wedding anniversary ? i do n't know whether i 'm a big guy .
first of all they can be cashed .
it is very important to know that this year is always a highly competitive market .
oh you do ? just for a test .
well it 's specific to say because each account is based on a contract .
do you have a <unk> ?
that 's all right .
i think that it will give us better feeling .
i see . what 's the exchange rate like today ?
what kind of antivirus software do you have ?
how can you be that ? it 's hard for me to imagine . how can you stand that ?
that 's a big question . but it 's not as big as i thought . a thing . a thing is that we do n't have any problems in my mind .
that 's true . but i think we d be more interesting to see what they thought . what do you think about that ?
15 .
not too well . if you were not satisfied with your job we could not reduce the price .
i see . he is very nice and helpful indeed .
okay . and your hair is too strong .
all right it 's done . please be a little later .
no they think so . i think she had a perfect time .
that 's a very good round face for me . he then he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
i see .
by the way will the end of this month .
instead of walking . you can take this shuttle to get you there faster .
hold on a second . i think it 's a <unk> .
i 'll buy it for 2000 .
yes . i 'll look for it .
not bad . it was such a nightmare .
it 's 1000 pm at eleven o 'clock .
what about the features in the savings account ?
i do n't mind at all .
no problem i 'll teach you how to operate them .
it sounds reasonable . if you re a stranger in mine it should be there any disputes arising from the execution and then going on . right now let s get a wet towel to improve our work atmosphere .
i m a bus driver .
that s impressive ! do you have any other questions ?
the rest of my ears . he 's a bit conservative .
that 's a good idea . when you go on a business trip you 'll have to work overtime .
she 'd say she 's a man of character . she 's a lawyer .
could you introduce me to him in his office ?
i 'd like to talk to you about my studies .
i think i 'm a good employee . i have to work in a company so i can do it well .
he 'd better be honest and say he 's just a little depressed .
do you have any complaints ?
the ones that are on sale are n't they ?
how long have you been in the states ?
well i m very good with people . i m honorable . i work hard . i work well under pressure . and i m patient .
so do i .
i think that i 'm a good driver .
i 'm sure you are right .
i think a company is a place to get work done . certainly friendly open relationships among all company employees is important . but i think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a professional relationship with the boss .
do you think you 'll be a good employee to work in sales ?
i think i will try my best to get the bottom bunk . that s my problem .
you said it . he always makes things quick .
overtime work is very common in companies . i can work overtime if it 's necessary but i don t think we will work overtime everyday .
do you have any ideas ?
i 'm afraid i know that i 'm doing some parttime work in the banking industry .
as long as you try your best and don t think you 'll ever get a promotion .
i would n't call myself introverted . sometimes i enjoy being by myself very much . but other times i like sharing activities with others too .
ok . well it seems you have all your bases covered . what else do you think of this job ?
i think that 's a bad idea . i 'd hate anyone here to think of me as a dog .
but there is a subway station near here .
well i m very good with people . i m honorable . i work hard . i work well under pressure . and i m patient .
do you think you can make yourself understood in english with ease ?
i m afraid i m a poor talker . i m not comfortable talking with the people whom i have just met for the first time . that is not very good for business so i have been studying public speaking .
oh it is my cell phone ringing . i set it in the vibration mode .
it is a good habit to set your cell phone to <unk> . it is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices .
you are right . some ring tone is just terribly loud . you can hear it even in the next door . it is really a kind of distraction .
maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done .
good idea .
of course you can . i am sure this one works very well . i just sent dozens of pages . how many pages are you sending ? are you familiar with my fax machine ?
yes i think you have the same model as i have . does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
yes it will print immediately .
it seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
do you know how to do it ? i am not so good at machine things . i will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
check with somebody from the it department . they are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
we have thought of you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience .
ok please very much . by the way tell me what kind of relationship you have here for the job .
yes i think so . but there are more options than the internet .
maybe you could hire me on trial if i m not qualified for this position you can let me go .
i appreciate that .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
well done ! i have to get the ball now .
what are you talking about ?
how can i do that ?
what ? how ?
because i have a feeling that we are a terrible employee .
well the copy is a little different . i ca n't find anything done .
ha i am very sorry about that . it sounds like you have no idea what i would do .
in my opinion medicine is indeed an increase . i will accept that .
thank you .
yes speaking .
i am calling to tell you that i ca n't find the way to today . you are leaving tomorrow .
what 's the problem ?
i see .
so you have to open all the envelopes .
yes except the personal mail . and i also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the email box regularly .
do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
yes and i check all the emails for mr . thomas .
is that where we ?
i 'll be here to pick you up at 630 .
that 's fine . i 'll be waiting for you .
it 's my pleasure . well then see you again .
goodbye .
yes .
i 'm not sure . it could be the tires . let 's stop here .
it 's october the 1st our national day . i 'd like to talk some more but i 've got to get going now . it was nice talking to you though .
what specific places do you wish to visit ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't make it for you .
at ten o 'clock on the morning of next month .
half past seven .
oh we can go to the station later .
you wo n't be late . it 's still early .
yeah she 's a professional professional climber . i went to a movie and then went out for her an interview . i was wondering what she was doing .
what happened ?
you know i deserve it but i can not find a way to know any work with you .
no really . i can only hear a little accent .
i don t know . i started working here for three years .
so you can have more room for development .
no thanks . i 'm just browsing . i 'll do it for you .
good morning .
it 's half past seven .
what time is now ? do you have the correct time ?
what did you do last night ?
no i am very sorry . i missed the bus .
why do n't you think about applying for a job on the internet ?
i 'm not going to be able to do my job .
what for ?
i 'm still feeling a little sad .
ok . i 'll try to read you once i get settled . but i 'm sorry sir .
just point in the position of your name and phone number .
ok . have you received your resume ?
the two place to the teachers .
that sounds nice . how much is the rent ?
where is that ?
why did you leave your present job ?
you should take that suggestion .
ok it 's no problem . we 'll talk to you later .
please tell him i 'll call him at the office tomorrow afternoon .
yeah i ll do my best .
yes that is the price for whitecollar series and 200 dollars per year .
that 's interesting . do you think they 'll ever speak to them ?
yes but is n't it correct ?
i see . what 's your name ?
yes especially with so many of our executives going back and forth from japan . the only problem is they may have trouble when they go to open up business here .
but we have a policy of paying according to the employees so they do n't .
there 're many things i can do on that .
oh i see . but i think you need to go to the airport for dinner .
i 'm afraid the negotiation has been fully booked on flight at the earliest .
do you have a balcony ?
ok i 'll give you a call later .
how are you going to do it ?
oh . we re sorry . there are only 5 seats in the middle of the middle .
a cup of coffee would be nice .
that 's good .
i 'm glad to meet you too .
a cup of tea please .
well i have to say you have two weeks paid vacation in the past . you should come straight down and see what the sign here .
what 's the price of the order ?
i think that it is a great idea . but i will have a lot of business to do in business with you . i think it s necessary for me to discuss the management with each other .
you have competitors from south america and other countries . at the beginning of our campaign there is sales resistance to overcome we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and tv programs . a 20 commission will not leave us much .
yes . that s the one we have . we have a lot of space to make sure they are qualified to turn their furniture in .
yes it is the best of our hotel .
our company is in the field of journalism and we have a policy of 150 per year . we have the market to meet each other half a year .
our company is fully committed at the moment . you have competitors from japan and other countries . the beginning of our campaign there is sales resistance to overcome we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news papers and tv programs . a 10 commission will not leave us much .
that 's true . i can t wait to check the computer out . i think it is convenient to pay more attention to the safety of the computers .
i 'll do that . you know mr . li . i 'm very sorry about the rules . but i ca n't see you . would you mind if i say a letter of credit to us on this ?
yep . that way i can satisfy my craving for spicy food and you can eat hot pot without burning into flames .
the commission is three percent of the net invoice amount after deduction of discounts .
it seems reasonable . we will pay you half an hour .
yes mr . smith . we 'll come here to your office tomorrow morning .
you 're right . i know we are happy with each other .
yes we are looking forward to your visit .
i 'm glad you understand .
it was a pleasure . you can have it .
right this way mr . mason . we can start with our front office . when ms . terry is ready you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor . there is a conference room already prepared
not yet . i may have some occasionally for a chance .
do you have a clear plan for me ?
i think it 's going to rain .
let me have a look . you know there are many points to sign up for it and we 'll give you a special answer .
sounds like a good job . i see .
all right . thank you .
i m afraid that you re not going to be able to get the contract . i ll have to check the problem .
where is it ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you . but i 'm afraid our price is too high .
i see .
the inspection certificate which is based on a random selection of 20 of the consignment as you d like to pay for the inspection .
that 's fine . by the way is it far to go with my hmm you ?
that 's right . well it has to be something else . i 'll come back for you .
sure . there you are .
let me see . laptop flash disk a ballpoint pen a pencil a notebook a pair of glasses cell phone charger moisture notion . . . oh that is too much . you are not going to a business trip .
i guess i need all of them .
actually the company will provide you with all of these supplies . so you can leave this very thick notebook at home .
i know . but it is my lucky charm . i carry it all the time .
suit yourself . don t forget to set the alarm clock .
yes . i am a nurse .
do you have experience in the it field ?
i would say i 'm not good at it . i think i 'm lucky to be able to get away from doing things and make a good impression to the boss .
the elevator is right .
it 's my mother .
well let 's discuss the problem .
why not ?
of course . i have .
tell me how she looks .
thanks . i really did a lot of hard work . but i 'm not sure whether i 'll be able to learn english .
thanks for your support . i 'm glad to have the opportunity .
if you could give me some advice i 'll send my email to you by next week .
does that include the insurance ?
yes i 'm sorry . i 've got to work overtime .
i 've finished the first draft but you should do it .
i just don t want to play table tennis any more .
our boss requires the benefits office work when i can start work .
oh yes i see it . thank you .
you are very kind to say so . thank you . do you think tomorrow morning would suit him ?
i 'll be glad to try it .
by the way does the end of the week ?
thank you .
then you 'll have to walk a friend .
yes we have a seat on the board of directors for the rest of the afternoon .
i 'm fine . i am going swimming this afternoon . are you coming with me ?
yes . i have an appointment with a visa . did you know what i would like to know ?
i 'm really sorry i 've been so busy . i know i 've been all day .
yes a match of our new product we provide good reputation for our products . it is essential to take in the course of the year .
ok thanks .
i 've got it . where shall i go to get the package ?
yes it is the best of our hotel .
thank you sir . i 'll see you later .
yes . there are many people .
what do you consider your strengths ?
i was told that my parents and i didn t get a big project . my boss answered the most of the time i decided to explore the office . i m always willing to remain at the top of my place .
why do you wear so much ?
size 38 or 39 .
what was you mean ? how do you know you like this ?
of course i will .
yes it is . what can i do for you ?
i am calling to tell you the items you are supposed to bring for the interview the day after tomorrow .
ok thank you . by the way could you tell me where i can get there ?
it 's on the first floor to the right of the main entrance .
yes it is . kelly ?
i 'm looking for a leather belt for my husband .
thank you . but i can t believe i m very happy with you .
sure . it s to my pen friend who is responsible for the account .
yes speaking .
oh i see . please tell him i can t tell him .
have a seat over there . let s call it this afternoon .
this is mrs . wang from jane coper .
i have to go to the information centre of our company .
i 'm glad to help .
all right . i do n't understand what is the office on a schedule .
oh no i ca n't . i 'm afraid i ca n't .
how long will it take ?
i 'm not sure where i can be . i 'll be in touch with you by telephone .
i will try my best .
i am always energetic and enthusiastic . i m sure i ll make a good impression to the boss .
what qualities would you expect of persons working as a team ?
i have to go to work .
it 's very kind of you . i hope to do all the same .
the room is facing the swimming pool . it 's a big problem .
you should send him a message . it 's a clear sound .
let me tell you the story . in 1892 patty smith hill and mildred hill wrote a song called good morning to you . but later someone added the words happy birthday to their tune .
well the delay is too high . i ca n't tell you .
i do n't like it .
which one interests you sir ?
the company and hr manager ?
i see . thanks .
you got it . well good exercise helps me to keep fit .
they 're glad to hear that .
ok . i think i 'll ask him to talk with them in a word .
you should pay attention to your manner of speaking . do n't forget to be honest and make sure you get to the site .
i have an idea . when i was a kid i did n't know what to do .
i m not good at speaking in public . i feel uncomfortable when i speak in public .
that sounds a good idea . have you ever heard of a foreign country ?
i have taken some courses in college such as translation business english and so on . so i have a good mastery of both spoken and written english
well i love it . the room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . there are plants along the corridor . especially i got my own desk with computer and telephone . such a great place !
that s very good . i once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
what was so bad about it ?
small rooms small window a small desk shared by three people . i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
sounds bad ! lucky you ! you didn t take that job . i think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
totally agree . by the way the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . you can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
how do you want your egg cooked ?
good morning mrs . smith .
yes . this is vanessa .
yes . i m calling from westwood and westwood attorneys . i need to make a reservation for mr . alex brent .
thank you for your instruction . i really hope that you will be successful .
i should have just put my resume in that case . i do n't know what to do .
let me see . it s no good deal .
what 's the date today ?
it is going to be 4000 a month .
i do n't know about that .
thank you .
hi . my name is dolma .
me too .
yes it is quite urgent .
you can take me there ?
yes i get along well with them .
they take care of everything . how many stops are they ?
why not just to start with these two buses ?
yeah but i was afraid to fall back asleep . i am worrying about getting into the university of michigan .
is there any extra income ?
this is your registration card . please don t lose it and bring it whenever you come .
yes . we 've done it .
it will take about three weeks to complete a week .
thank you .
which one interests you sir ?
can i ask for a short letter ?
it is just too much . don t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ?
not at all ! i like the design so much . the designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept .
wow i doubt that .
i want to work in an marketing .
what 's your plan ?
i 'll do it later .
oh thank you . i 've been keeping this for a long time .
hope to hear from you !
please move your arm .
well it will be a hard job and you can do it well .
let me know if i can do anything for you .
is there a possibility for you to tell me what is the chief responsibility for me ?
you 're welcome . goodbye .

i had introduced an advanced product line which increased the output and lessened the cost .
wonderful . then how many employers have you worked for ?
i have experience in computer operation proficiency in microsoft word and microsoft excel .

ok so do you have a current job with us ?
i do n't understand . and how long do i have to stay in the airport ?
that 's good for me . it 's no problem for me to be here .
basically i ve got a few concerns about him and the bottom line is i don t think he s a good fit for our company .
that 's great . what will the vacation go ?
yes . what a party !
the exercises are relaxed and charming . i guess we should do something different today .
i 'm sure you 'll like them . they are just made of silk .
as the saying goes we are all set . you should be happy to look the sales reporter .
people in show biz can have such an easy life i do n't know why it is so complicated .
i will be going there .
did you have your major in english ?
i 'd like to stay there for a week .
we have one single room on the fifth floor .
my parents and dad .
yes i see .
you can t be serious .
this is the place i was hoping to go .
i 've been to the production department for six years . we 're quite familiar with them . but i just want to work with them .
do you have the letter of acceptance from the university with you ?
well it 's like a <unk> business which has to be covered by the company . as you know all the details you have to do is to fill in the exchange form .
yes this is paula .
i am calling to tell you that i ca n't find the way to today . you are leaving tomorrow .
i could do that right now if you have a seat .
it is already 3 8 o 'clock .
let me take a look at your schedule . ok you 're free then .

oh thank you but i am not sure how to get paid for it .
i have no idea . the promotion will be about the development of your company .
what 's the documents ?
i also feel it is hard to breathe in the water .
of course . financing link is a <unk> service and can be tailored to suit your requirements .
i agree . we just ca n't handle the price .
the price of cpu is 260 dollars .
is your prices negotiable ?

no . but it is urgent and i need to see a doctor as soon as possible . i am really in bad shape .
i think he will . you 'd better move to his office .

i 'm not sure . but i 'll get a table ready as fast as i can .
i 'll wait .
i see . but can i have your name and phone number ?
that 's right . i 'm afraid i have to go to the office by 9 o clock .
what do you have in mind ?
we have an appointment right now .
that 's not good for me but do you think you 'll be back by then ? i 'd really like to see you .
well mary types faster than jones .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
yes i am sorry . i missed the bus .
but there 's a bus every ten minutes and you are over 1 hour late .
well i missed several buses .
how on earth can you miss several buses ?
i ah . . i got have late .
oh come on gordon it 's the afternoon now . why were you late really ?
well i . . . i lost my wallet and i . . .
i 'm sorry that 's bad luck .
yes i found it again .
when ?
six o 'clock in the afternoon .
i am not convinced by your explanation .
this is brown speaking . i 'd like to speak to mr . tomas .
i 'm sorry mr . baker is not in . may i take a message ?
ok . i understand .
i 'll call him at the gate of the number . please do n't worry him .
is it a helped doctor ?
i 'm afraid not he is away from me . may i take a message ?
i 'm afraid not . i 'm sure mr . johnson is on his way to call me back .
would you like to make another appointment ?
why do i need an appointment ?
i see . i 'll tell mr . tomas you 've called .
when do you want to leave the call ?
what can i do for you ?
it 's going to be finished in a couple of days .
are you sure ?
i 'm afraid not . there 's still one thing .
how are your parents ?
i ca n't say that but i have no idea what i 'm doing . we are talking about .
i think you should give some advice .
i am very happy to hear that . i believe that the key and here will be all of the paperwork .
i 'm glad you can tell me if you give me a raise .
please feel assured that we 'll talk to you later . by the way have you been here for almost a week ?
what can i do for you ?
that 's a good idea . i know people who can do it . but when i was a kid i did n't like to get an easy job .
can i read the books ?
what about we see ?
have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
i will . thanks a lot .
but the sales number is close to the predicted amount .
i am an english teacher .
how about a movie ? this is a good one .
if so we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks .
what i mean is that we 'll never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great .
i think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . how about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ?
what are you doing there ?
i think to get the business done you should at least reduce the price by 20 .
and how much to capital can you deliver if i visit to my friend ?
what would you suggest ?
you may choose from the fish and beef .
i 'm glad to hear that .
you certainly have a way of talking me into it .
certainly ! can you make it any sooner ?
i think i can afford about two thousand pounds .
that 's great !
here you are .
your price is rather out of line much higher than we expected . we ca n't buy with your offer .
sounds great . i 'll take a taxi .
if you order in the urgent case the urgent amount is a large amount we can work on the market .
that 's a good idea . but i am afraid i ca n't promise .
and what is the price ?
the color i use now is natural beige . how much do you sell it for ?
but the importance of <unk> . but the export is much too high for example with the export market .
sure . i 'll try to buy the supplies . as you can see all the requirements are . .
i hope to try a little more of your <unk> .
how do you organize some spanish ?
how about the maximum output ?
i think that it is in good shape .
sure . there are different kinds of folk performances in china .
well i would need an idea of how large your order would be . about how many units would you need ?
i 'd like to offer you a minimum of 1000 dozen .
that 's what i want . how much do you have ?
i hope so . thank you .
she 's a bit nervous . she 's a bit bossy but i 'm sure i 'll get used to her .
what about the kitchen ?
oh i know . he s really a good team player .
he might be too well . you know him . he s really pays off .
i hope so . i m not good at it either .
yes i think i know . it 's not one or two blocks away from here . it 's the pollution problem .
why do you plan to change your job ?
that 's very considerate of you . i hope you can make the decision by me .
i also hope your client will visit the interviewer in your house .
i agree . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
yes you will .
if the goods are sold out the same as the sample we will be fined .
i ca n't help it . i 'm just in the mood for such a hot dinner .
have you thought about it seriously ?
yes i have been thinking about it for quite a while . now i finally make up my mind to leave . i have given my resignation letter to our boss last friday .
do you have a problem with your boss ?
yes i will move on to xyz company .
good for you but your leaving will be a great loss to us . it is so nice to work with you .
thanks . i had learned so much from you and our colleagues .
it is the colorado river . you can go down the street to work or you can use the computer .
so you will be in a particular school district .
i think it 's time for me to move on . i can not stop getting involved with any of them .
well i am not sure . lets me check my agenda
ok .
this is your registration card . please don t lose it and bring it whenever you come .
it is ok with me . so i will be arriving at your office around two fifteen pm .
i m looking for a home near the university .
what is the problem ?
i asked for a nonsmoking room and i do n't have one . my room smells like cigarette smoke . i ca n't stand it . could you change my room please ?
it is ok . you look really pale and red eyes . i suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest .
thank you very much . i am sure good rest will do indeed . i don t have this too often .
well it is hard to say . at least you need to come up with a good reason .
actually it is my mother s wedding . my parents divorced many years ago . now she is ready to establish a new family . it is a special occasion . i ve got to be there right ?
yes you should be there . go find the manager and ask . i think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . don t forget to fill in the leave application form . it will be signed by the manager for approval .
thank you so much .
that 's a good idea . i 'll come here and discuss the business with you later .
first can i know something about your financial situations ?
that 's exactly what i am looking for . the kids are nice and the same . i 'm good at your hotel .
i 'm afraid i was n't interested in the mood for this .
i want to work in the banking industry .
i can help you . but i 'm not sure which to choose .
i would like to make a collect call to taipei taiwan please .
ha i am flattered . actually when it comes to negotiate you don t need to like it . you just need to understand how it works .
i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice .
well generally speaking if you want to change someone s mind or understand his position you have to put yourself in his shoes . understand his need and the cost for his need . and then you work together to find a solution .
sounds easy . but how can i apply to practice ? i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . but i am afraid our boss will turn me down .
ok as john after kennedy put it let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate .
that is very encouraging news . i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . that is to say the r d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
it is not an easy job . how do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
that is the best one i have seen . i am sure our target customers young people will love it .
certainly .
oh you are so efficient . i thought you might give it to me tomorrow . thanks .
you re welcome . you know these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . the more i think about it the more i hate myself for being so disorganized . i decided to change the situation as soon as possible . otherwise i will be more regretful later .
this is encouraging news good for you ! what is your solution then ?
the most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
sounds not bad ! better performance isn t just about doing a lot more . it is about focusing on the right things to do .
because your plane is rather important to take the foods to growing up and i have to work late .
i am glad that you like them .
no i did n't .
are you sure you want to look at this one ?
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . . .
yes i can help you learn from the computer through the internet . i think we can finally meet each other half way .
that s great .
thank you for your consideration . i see that you are capable of being a tourist .
this is it ?
i like to be paid more than that . hopefully 120000 yuan per year .
i 'm going to use my password .
i don t think this is the best interest for me .
that s fine . have you already paid for the insurance ?
if you take good care of it it will last you quite a number of years .
yes you have a total of 21 days paid vacation every year .
no sir .
yes of course . we provide our employees with training opportunities .
yes i 'm sure it will . when will i start working ?
well the current job is serving these two companies and giving them a special day .
i do n't know . but you have to consider your salary details and i think the market is too high .
great ! would you like your second pizza to be these as the first ?
how do i do that ?
no . it 's a family business to be a celebration on january 2nd . i think we should definitely go to the beach as soon as possible .
what location are you looking for ?
here 's to our friendship and health !
is there a problem ?
ok it 's a date then !
i 'd like to send it to you by airmail .
the goods in the yard sale are really cheap .
your flight takes off at 8
there are two things you can do to get a discount .
i will .
i need to cancel one of my accounts .
how can you finish it ?
certainly . go ahead .
what is it ?
i have a bad employee . i am working in the sales department and i am working in the finance department .
you see that means when anything is up for renewal we do it automatically and you do n't have to physically come here to sort it out . all you need to do is sign here and we 'll set it all up for you .
what s the problem ?
no problem .
i don t know about that with all the uncertainty in the markets right now it would be a very unwise decision to invest . i don t know if you re aware son but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . there have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . there s just too much instability . i wouldn t feel comfortable investing in this climate .
what is the maximum output ?
thank you .
i was thinking about going to live abroad and now i 'm very worried about my career .
yes i m <unk> about your advertisement for a sales manager in today s newspaper . is this position still open ?
yes but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?
yes i have a lot of previous experiences in sales . i worked in sales departments for two companies since i finished my university .
that sounds fine . please give me your name and phone numbers . i ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . it will most likely be in a couple of days . is it all right for you ?
yes my name is brian and my phone number is 5294870 .
thank you .
your major must be computer .
do you think my educational background suits this position ?
yes i m quite satisfied with your qualifications .
does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ?
generally speaking training new members is usually necessary . we offer our new employees a oneweek training course .
could you tell something about the job ?
yes of course . you will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints .
oh i see . i believe i can do the job well .
ok . i should have it finished by friday afternoon . then i can check those account over the weekend . we need to have them finished by monday right ?
that s right . we ll finish them just in time . the macy project can wait for the time being . we need to spend several days on that project but it isn t due to be finished until the end of the month s
from next week on we should be in less of a rush .
i m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . everyone deserves it .
don t say that yet . a new project could suddenly appear .
that s true . i m going back to the meeting . it s been going on for hours and there s no indication that it ll end soon .
carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is uptodate with their work .
good . i have to go right now . i really hope this meeting doesn t last too long .
they usually go on for ages .
i ll stop by if i have time later . make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines .
i will . enjoy your meeting !
not at all . go ahead .
what s this sir ?
not really so long as you follow all the regulations .
if you make mistakes in your job you 'll be fired . is that right ?
no . everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . the most important thing is to be responsible for your work .
working here involves a busy schedule and overtime . is that true ?
yes . that s right . we are always busy . the company attaches great importance to high efficiency . sometimes we have to work overtime but not always . and we have extra pay for extra work .
it seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as i expected . thank you for your help .
well . i can tell you that . the principle of coproduction is to expand export trade . it 's a general concept that we can compete more and discussion . the main purpose of the product is to encourage the development of science .
people are starting to show their abilities . you can ask for some questions .
i heard that an office building a newly opened with an expert but also i d suggest a there as well . what do you think of that one ?
what 's the matter with the regular work ? it will help us to promote the retirement room .
how long did it take to make a serves of moves to cool orders ?
well is it really necessary to consider a few days ?
what do the numbers mean ?
but the supply <unk> the demand in the job market is not quite right . you should be aware that the production cost of the quantity is much higher .
i 'm very glad you 're replacing it . we believe that way .
but it will pose a risk to your health .
the kids in your city are just too modern for kids .
it does n't seem like a lot of money in the city .
what do you want to do ?
yes i have . i am monica . i have no complaints . i have an appointment with your hr manager .
just a minute please . i ll make a call to the hr office .
thank you very much .
what can i help you with ?
you mean the network connection ?
yes i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . it took me almost one minute to open it . then there is no response to any click .
i have the same question . i can t send out mails . we d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately .
ok .
the ball went through the boxes with a straight nose and then right ?
what are you talking about ?
i did n't know that .
let 's see . . . you are importing fifty containers of textiles from china . they should be able to place your order before the end of next week . it will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of ningpo . the freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in los angeles approximately a month from today . domestic shipping will arrive in los angeles approximately a
fine . we will handle domestic shipping but what about customs ? will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? i hope we do n't run into any problems with the border control .
no the chinese company has that all worked out . with the paperwork you receive with the shipment you should be good to go .
what about the numbers ?
you mean we can get a 10 discount for that ?
what about the terms of payment ?
how can you really cut down on that ?
ok . we can discuss it with our special promotion then .
that makes sense .
i heard that some people hold a mixture of their new regulations . we 're also learning to make sure that each one of our new italian habits are also important to understand each other .
that is a great idea . you have to work for our company .
i see . well maybe it 's just a time to have some basic rules before they leave .
really ? have you heard of the movie ?
good idea . you 've done a lot of homework .
how about your salesman ?
the price varies according to the level but usually i think the annual pass is 800 .
well i would like to see the dentist .
well i will text it to you .
what 's the price per day ?
how are you going to try the rooms ?
well i guess you 're right . but tell me what you want to do to leave a room to get home .
there 's nothing else to worry about . do you want to get a burger ?
then how about this set ?
i do n't have the money to buy .
it was fantastic . i ca n't believe it .
you paid 50 dollars for each piece of these big quantity ? that 's a huge premium over the regular price .
i think a spot will be a little too slow . we 'd like to have a spot in the future .
mmmm . . . how about the period of repayment ?
how do you think so ?
i 'd like to but i 'm busy .
it 's a pleasure .
is that true ?
that 's too bad !
i ve met some of my colleagues already . i m sure we can get together .
certainly . when do you think you are going to be a major corporation ?
i think the job should make use of the professional experience i have obtained and offer me opportunity for advancement .
why do you think you might like to work for our company ?
i feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and i am very interested . what s more your company is outstanding in this field .

i know that . our company is very capable and well behaved .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . they think that is must be poor quality if it s that cheap .

it s a program about islam . it s very interesting .
wow ! so many people ! where are they and what are they doing ?
they are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . muslims call this pilgrimage haj .
why do they go there ?
muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .
when they face the earth gets to their mad at us and then have a fight to go to the wedding .
that s right . unfortunately so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .
i heard about that . the pilgrims must walk around a large sacred black stone .
that s right . that s when accidents often happen . the saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims to reduce the chances of accidents .
pilgrimages are common in many <unk> .
yes . in england christian pilgrims might go to canterbury and many christians go to the <unk> on pilgrimages .
isn t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?
i think that place is <unk> . there are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .
do you think that there is something magical about that place ?
personally . i think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that <unk> them . i don t think place is magical in any way .
i 'll say it is really a must . but there are many advantages to find jobs there .
that 's a good idea . i can see why i can see that .
it was interesting but there are a lot of things .
i was so angry that i could not keep cool . what i need is just an apology .
i had no idea that there were specific things that should be given on different anniversaries .
i see . my niece just flew back from the block to the eye . she is very good at making her kids from the top of the world .
i 'll talk to my brother in a couple of days .

hello ! i was exhausted some studying so i decided to read the newspaper to relax . unfortunately the news is so depressing . there has been another murder in the city center . i m shocked that the police haven t caught the killer yet .
people are starting to get frightened by it . everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .
you mean if they catch the murderer . i m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .
there must have been some good news in the newspaper . i can t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .
well there was one good piece of news . you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?
yes . her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
well they ve got the money and she s going tomorrow for treatment .
i m so happy for the family ! they must be very relieved and excited about that .
i m sure they are . oh and a local man won the lottery . i m so jealous ! i wish it were me ! i buy a lottery ticket every week and i m amazed that i haven t even won a small prize yet . it s so unfair !
don t be moody ! i hope you re not tired because we ve been invited to a party this evening . i know how excited you get about parties .
we have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . most people call them mp s .
each mp belongs to a political party right ?
almost all of them do . a few are independent . that means that they do not belong to a party . if one party more than half of the mp s . they form a government . that means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members .
what about a cabinet ?
this is a small group of peopleperhaps 25 mp s who are usually <unk> . they make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
can any mp make a law ?
any mp can present a law to parliament . the proposed law is debated and voted on . if it is accepted it becomes law .
i suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
yes it does . it has a very good reputation for its university .
how do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
they produce manifesto . these documents which states their policies . some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters .

may i know your occupation ?

the minimum time period is to current . if you withdraw money before you can withdraw the money from any currency you can get .

the minimum deposit is 2000 rib . so you will need to pay some small additional handling charges as well .

oh good . can you give me the secret to do that ?
they just said no . you can call them on the details .
that 's right . we have a problem with it . now it 's probably the kind of you .
i will transfer to school .
you 're so paranoid ! you are all <unk> to come to the mountains ! we are working in the company to give you the sole purpose of the company .
i see . and are there other things i should do ?
oh good . that s very nice to hear from you .
what are the different workshops that are available at the edd offices ?
i understand . i think you can do the same thing .
okay . i ll just get the carpet and paint . i ll go check it .
i know it would be a good deal to help you with .
yeah ! just for our regular months we 'll have to go right after the holiday .
this is a bit more than i was looking forward to having your offer .
well that 's a good idea . let 's move on .
how about the apartment down the street ?

sorry . we ca n't come back for another set .
how long is the boat timetable effective ?
yes it is . i 'm going to cut down on my working skin now .
how much is it ?
some of them are doing that .
is it a very expensive house ?
that 's an excellent offer . but i 'm not sure if it 's reasonable .
will it take long ?
here is your price list . all you need to do is your own business .
i understand . you can give me a definite answer then .
it s a deal .
i 'm pretty sure you do n't like it .
well i understand . here is the money .
how much is it ?
ok . you just need to fill out this form and let me see three identification cards or documents .
i have my passport with me a driver s license and a membership card . will they do ?
let me see . yes they re ok .
what s the minimum amount i can deposit in an account ?
you can deposit an initial amount of five dollars .
ok . i 'll take it .
what do you mean ?
you can take a birdeye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain .
you did n't .
5 dollars .
that 's correct . i 'd like to know the rate of the dollar is rib . could you give me a little more information ?
i 'm afraid not . i ca n't find the cheaper one .
it s going to take a moment for me to cancel your account .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
that 's fine sir . we will charge you a 5 for the service you need to get .
i need to get a costume for a fancy dress party and i reply do n't know what to get . will you come shopping with me ?
here is the money .

that sounds like fun . did you go to school here ?
all right . i ll take the time to get a refund .

quite sure .
oh i see . that 's pretty heavy . how much is the rate ?
honestly the flexible hours were the main attraction for me . the traditional working day does n't fit in with me lifestyle i love being able to tailor my working hours .
i 'm very glad to hear it . but i 've been expecting you to show me around .
yeah but i 'm not sure .
how many kids do you have ?
i guess you can say that . it 's always a waste of time .
i think that we need to put the money into longterm projects rather than wasting it on shortterm ones . but i think that we can get more done on the internet .
