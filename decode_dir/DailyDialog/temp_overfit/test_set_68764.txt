i appreciate your help .
i can tell you when you are here .

i just want to tell you the truth i m a fit .

yes certainly . let s go .
i 'm try to write a letter to one of our clients but i just do n't know exactly what to say i do n't even know how to get started i know i should write dear mr . mrs . or ms . but the problem is i do n't know the name of contact person .
no problem .
but you re playing it .
i 'm quite sure . i 've always loved working with children .
what was you reading ?
well it may be my pleasure .
ok sir . how about this one ?

fine . it 's just what i need to do .
honey . . . you 're going to dust everything in the first time . it 's really a nice night .

where 's the book ?
i am very grateful for your advice .
ok let 's go !
yes i think so . do you want to put it on ?
that 's fine .
of course . that 's a really good choice for you .
what about the chicken ?
sure . it s a piece of cake to keep you straight .
no .
what do i do ?
all you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef .
do you know how to set the timer ?
i think we need the <unk> .
that 's true .
it was n't too bad .
what do you mean ?
but i have to go back to the library first .
really ? that 's really interesting .
hold on
you look a little secret .
as you know we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product lseries .
it says that it is a war memorial .
it 's under the table .
honey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a german company .
i like yellow best .
here you are . it s very attractive .
that 's a point . i 'm not sure that we 'll agree to that . the chinese art designers are going to have a lot of time here .
well you can buy a computer for free . but you do n't have to .
we do n't have a decent first aid kit do we ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
are you sure you 're using my child ?
it was only a few weeks ago . i do n't know .
o . k . see you later .
really ? can i get one from you ?
how can you get one ?
oh i am very sorry about that . we will both have the same talk with him and maybe i could get back to you in a few weeks .
right .
no it 's not all . if you 're right i 'll surely get the right person .
he sure is .
until you go to bed right away . the weather is great .
i think i can deposit it into my checking account .
fine . what about the green one ?
it 's not too bad . there are about twenty people working with them .
when you have your id with you it you can pick up your prescription from the atm you 'll need to take it or we can send it to your friends .
are there many accidents in the city every day ?
i do n't know but i think they 're alright .
alright . let 's go !
ok . there 's a lot of new tickets .
what 's your favorite color ?
yes .
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
please i 'd like a ticket to new york .
where do you need to go to ?
my skin is kind of oily .
i 'll pick a shampoo that 's just right for your hair type . sit right here and rest your neck on the side of the sink . is the water too hot ?
i ll take the advice .
you can choose from several play modes or you can use the fullspectrum equalization 3 d mode and mega bass features . we recommend using it with the studio monitor headphones .
it 's not so much about the price .
yeah it is .
you look wonderful .
you 're absolutely right !
yes . there is one more thing .
you should buy a live alone .
yes i m here to see joanna stevens . i have an appointment at four .
you have your card right ?
size 41 . i want something in dark flannel .
well sir i think that you 're a nice pan too . do you like this one ?
i like it a lot .
sure .
may i turn on the radio then ?
of course . what kind of games do you like ?
i think you should look for another pair of shoes .
the best product is a little more expensive but it has a lot of sun and even the kind of feature films . do you prefer ?
no the brown one .
what 's that ?
it was a few things .
did you eat any cake ?
we accept the price .
very good . i 'll take these two very good terms and a minimum of both events .
well you get nine hundred anytime minutes and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other <unk> clients one thousand text messages per month and unlimited evening and weekend minutes . oh and we also offer a rollover option .
i understand .
i have an appointment with something from the 15th .

no there is n't .
no kidding ! when will he be back ?
you 're welcome .
yes sir . but there is a charge for alcoholic beverages in economy class . would you please go to the reserve room ?
i do n't know . i never went to a dance class with me and i wanted to try it on .
but my mother always gives me weight .
well i do n't like fruit huh ?
i never thought of that .
yeah . i 'm really looking forward to it .
ok so what about the chicken ?
i have a table for six for six .
what kind of stamps do you want ?
how about some steak ?
i must weigh it first . err . . . it 's five grams over weigh do you want to send it as an ordinary or registered letter ?
all right .
it depends on the weight of the total amount .
i want it registered . how much is it then ?
that 's 10 .
ok . i 'll take it .
yes i am . are you on the diet ?
what is that ?
thanks . i 'm totally pumped up .
tell me about it .
i eat more fruits and vegetables and chicken .
really ? what do you have in mind ?
i wanted to but the guy is on the sidewalk . he said he had an accident .
ahahah . . . . you do n't have fried food at all . you really have to eat anything you eat and drink with your diet .
i know . my stomach just cut a lot of fat and i 've got to eat .
that 's pretty bad . but if the company asks what else can we do to the overtime ?
what ?
so do i .
did this just come on suddenly ?
i know . i could n't eat another bite !
you 're welcome .
the new bar is coming .
it 's been a long time since i was a kid .
you 've got plenty of time .
i do n't like the smell of the grass .
that 's true . we 're going to get out of a lot .
but you were talking about it ? maybe i can help you find something for you .
he is a bootlicker . i can t believe it when he is here .
i know that . he would think you were crazy caroline .
our kind of hard work is n't it ?
that 's a good idea .
that 's nice .
ok mr . lee . you are going to have a seat in the back of the office .
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
i do n't really enjoy that .
it 's good .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
it is really great . i have brought the vegetables and i almost finished with it .
i just got a message from my sister saying she is going to be my girlfriend .
yes in fact .
it 's josh o neil .
he was a very good player .
which kind do you prefer ?
yeah . i really wanted to know .
if i can do anything i can do .
it 's true . for me to lose weight .
perhaps you should excercise more . why do n't you go to an exercise class .
yeah you 're right . sometimes i make up my mind that 's what i want .
i 'm not sure . medium i suppose . maybe a little on the heavy side .
why ?
i know you 're right but what do you think we should do ?
really ? what 's the matter ?
thanks .

no it 's not far .
that s very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you very much .
do n't mention it .
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second intersection . the post office will be on your left .
that s a lot of money .

that s too bad .
i think it 's a little bit too long for me .
it 's a lucky drive .

what 's the purpose for your visit ?
fresh fruits and vegetables are important along with protein and whole grains .
nothing like that .
that 's 10 .
thank you . where should i send your final phone bill ?
is that your new bicycle ?
is there any other way you can make a decision ?
we should probably look around for something else . if you want to get a good idea with a new carpet we can get all the floors and might be able to have the furniture in the end .
it sounds like a good deal . what do you think of this one ?
what about the others ?
what do you mean ?
what about the climbing in your room ?

mr . brown you have a good suggestion . we 've got a full range of order for you and then your credit rating will be given you a lot of the loan .
well we 'd like to live in a quiet house .
ok . let s go !
i love the bigger one .
fine .
are you kidding ?
it 's not aware of the marked handicapped spot .

yes it is . there is an interesting interview with a top director about it .
thank you . it 's a good habit to have a membership in all your country .

ok . you can go to the school of the city centre if you have any one .
i feel a little tired . i 've got a sore throat .
are you more of a follower or a leader ?
i like no thanks . i 'd like to have a ice tea .
all right . would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?
it 's fine for me .
i think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . though its taste is not perfect it 's really cheap and convenient .
exactly . nescafe is the world 's favorite coffee . people love it all over the world ?
what country does the best ?
yes . no doubt about that . for us coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . i heard chinese people do n't drink that much coffee .
no we do n't . i like coffee . but i love coffee .
yes . in fact if you go to school you just have to go to school you can take the bus and go to school to school on day and after the class .

oh i m afraid i have been sick .
you re right . maybe that s why she keeps calm and down the ground . i bet you could spend too much on the weekend .
well the main reason is that i 've done a lot of homework in writing . i think i 'm a little confused .
can i have my 200 please ?
i see . the doctor says he 's done a lot and more in the way he 's got lots of homework too . he was really nervous .

what a shame !
ok . thank you .
it 's too salty .

i wonder how long he can take this kind of bag .
what 's wrong with him ?
he 's out of town .
it 's true sir .
it 's not far away from here . let 's go into the restaurant .
oh i 'm sorry . there 's a mistake on the street .
i have been washing clothes here since a few years ago .
i agree . i 'll wait for you .
you 're welcome .
i really want to try the bathroom .
yes it 's not far away .
sure . i 'd like to try it on .
the next beginning class is on the left .
so i do n't need to worry about that .
you 're welcome .
i believe so .
now we 're going to have a regular hard time in the gym .
i do n't know . it 's a waste of time to think the kids are trying to hide the role in the water .
why ?
but i am not sure if it goes well .
okay i 'll take a taxi .
my mom just wants everything . it 's just the first time he 's here !
i 'm sorry . we do n't have any spare room today .
it 's the very latest design .
you re welcome .
what 's the price ? it 's very expensive .
what kind of benefits does this job have ?
well that depends . but i have to pay my worth it .
you said you were only going to window shop !
she 's only 29 . 95 .
what do you mean ? we 're talking about our but we still have to go back to this green line .
she 'll do it .
i hope it will be a great pleasure to have a taste of its color . i 'm sure you will love it .
yes someone gave me your invitation number .
cool down harry ! what are you really mad about ? did you get ripped off ?
yes . last sunday i went to a nearby market . it was on <unk> fair . i chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot without even trying to strike a bargain . i paid one hundred and twenty . and just
is that so ? i 'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . it 's the norm of free trade . the seller sets
but do n't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?
of course that 's something really irritation . and the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . i recommend you to consult the price tags in the superb
that 'll be fine .
i wo n't be able to fall asleep .
to begin with i would n't mind the poet 's body .
you see because we are too busy a we eat a lot of time .
no i have n't got plans on the phone .
i go to bed at ten and get up at six .
that 's helpful for your health .
sure .
yes i am .
yes . does that mean you can find that ?
what 's the matter ?
what kind of dessert do you want ?
yeah . i think i can find something that i might be coming around . i just want to go to the beach anytime .
thank you .
i m sorry . he is not in right now . would you mind speaking to speak to her ?
sure . this is nigel smith his personal banker . could you ask him to return my call ?
thanks . i appreciate your help .
10 .
here you are . and here are your passports back .
yes we do .
would you mind if i helped out in the kitchen instead ? i do enjoy cooking .
this is supposed to be your vacation we 'd like you to just relax .
cooking makes me feel relaxed . so what are we cooking ?
ok well we 're going to make a pan of lasagne a salad and some garlic bread . here 's the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?
sure . we should probably preheat the oven right away too .
that 's a good idea . can you set the oven to 200 degrees celsius ?
that 's a bit high for lasagne . i 'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there .
fine . i 'll just get out the casserole dish the <unk> the salad bowl and the baking sheet .
you know i could do this myself . why do n't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ?
i do n't think it 's broken .
well if it 's not broken then you need to learn how to vacuum better because it does n't look like you 've vacuumed for ages !
fine . i 'll go vacuum . let me know if you need any other help .
yes of course . it 's quite a bit far from here .
will you let me know where to get off ?
sure . it 's two blocks down the road . you can take the elevator or the stairs .
thank you very much .
oh yes . i 'll call you if you like .
thank you very much .
if you want to leave you must be sure it will take about half an hour .
thank you .
you re welcome . feel free to ask me any time you need help .
of course . is the dinner still on ?
yes i was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .
we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .
that 's what i thought you would do . listen i live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . it 's just down the street from all the bars . you probably do n't want to be walking around after dark .
it ca n't be that bad .
i wish it was n't but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .
really ? i never would have guessed . the criminals must only come out in the evenings because i 've never noticed anything strange when i 've been at your house in the daytime .
do me a favor and take a taxi . it 'd make me feel a lot better .
ok we will . how do you get around in the evenings ?
when i first moved in i walked everywhere . but within a week i had my purse stolen just a block away from the police station ! now i always take public transportation .
has anything else happened to you ?
i have quite a few fights on the streets after the bars .
well we 'll be careful . thanks for letting me know .
re it or you re getting up late . the office is falling apart and the may suddenly break up in the morning .
are there many accidents in the city every day ?
but you know things are just too deep .
what are your salary expectations ?
any rain ?
why do n't we go for the bus ?
if you have any more questions about your future let me know .
my colleagues quickly get promotions while i always get sidelined . i do n't know what to do anymore .
you know what ?
well i was wondering what the main role is for the 90 day ?
what a pity . i was looking forward to a car accident just because it 's as close as possible .
i think that two people might be hurt .
really ? that 's so cool .
i am afraid the traffic is not .
i do n't understand .
i do n't know . . . well in winter they 're often talking about to a kid .
yes sir . may i help you ?
yes sir . where to ?
ok we will take you there .
we have a selection of orange juice to choose from here .
no problem . we can wait for you .
it 's a priority seat . we can not give you a reservation .
no problem . do n't worry the taxi is faster than the bus .
maybe we can wait a few minutes .
you know i hate shopping more than anything else in this world .
i know . but we could get some exercise in and we could get some errands run too . windowshopping won t cost you anything .
what kind of errands do we need to run ?
well we could go to the newsagent s to pick up the sunday paper go to the butcher s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner and to the chemist s to pick up your prescription from the doctor .
i 'll only go if we can stop at the <unk> to pick up something to drink for tonight .
fine we 'll be ready in a few minutes .
sounds good . you re a lifesaver .
i promise . we re only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven t had time for .
ok let s go then !
hey darling i think i might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . i was so relaxed . it felt as if i were in another world .
i m afraid not .

it s the worst thing i ve ever tried .
hi there mr . sandals . your name is michelle . what can you do for your reservation ?
speaking .
so ?
yes here is my bank card .
thank you .
because i m not in the mood that s why .
well don t just sit there do something . come and help me in the kitchen .
help you in the kitchen i don t feel like it .
would you like to clear the table then ?
really ? do i have to do it ?
not if you don t want to .
really it 's so beautiful .
well thank you very much .
you must n't pick it in this place .
where it is ?
it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
yes ?
can you tell me the way to the peak tram please ?
why not ?
i have a feeling that i like to wake up in five minutes .
i 'm sorry .
what can you do ?
sorry i 'm very near sighted .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do it again .
thank you . hopefully i wo n't have to call the phone company again .
well there s no rush . you can come to my office tomorrow and call me back later .
if you just sign it you can fix it at the moment and we 'll recommend it for you .
i am not surprised you eat too much .
and i suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office does n't help .
yes i think so .
i do wish i could lose weight .
well why do n't you go on the diet ?
i 've tried diets before but they 've never worked .
perhaps you should excercise more . why do n't you go to an exercise class .
yes maybe i should .
that is just an excuse . you can always find some time to exercise .
but i work hard all the time for long hours . often i have no time for lunch . yet i am still getting fatter .
bill you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . and skipping meals will not help you lose weight . in fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals .
i know you 're right but what can i do ?
how about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ?
but i 'll miss the news . it s important in my business to keep up with events in china .
i know i know . have you got a portable radio ? you can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time .
that 's a good idea !
medium .
what 's the matter sir ?
ok ! i am happy that you decided to come in and buy the kitchen .
well i do n't know .
there are so many people here .
ok . let me have them brought to you .
i 'd be glad to .
ok . . .
well i swim and run every day .
now tell me what do you eat ?
well i do n't eat any meat but i do eat fish and eggs .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
oh yes and fruit i love fruit .
what do you drink ?
well i never drink alcohol coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
what do you drink ?
you too . have you lost some weight ?
yes i took off 4 kilos . i am glad you notice it .
not some crazy diet fat i hope .
it 's about time .
how do you deal with those who you eat ?
ah yes that 's right .
ah yes that 's right .
this is john .
oh yes i see . do you have any other suggestions ?
why not ?
no thanks . i have had enough .
actually you have n't have much .
to tell you the truth i am on the diet .
that sounds ridiculous . why ?
well i am gaining weight these days and i have to watch my calories .
yeah let 's go .
you are not really chubby . you are actually thin enough .
i do n't think so . i know i 've put on weight this winter .
so you are watching your weight are n't you ?
yes to tell you the truth . i am on the diet .
where are you heading now ?
i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road . it is very close to your house .
is that the university next to the teachers college ?
that 's the one .
you mean we 'll share the taxi ?
yeah . if we share the cab it 'll be cheaper . besides that your chinese is better than mine . the drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though i practice my pronunciation carefully .
well . don t worry about it i will be happy to share the taxi with you .
not very far from here . we 'll fly . it 's about one and a half hours .
are you in a hurry ?
i have plenty of time .
would you mind telling me how much you want to pay for it ?
there 's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
i 'll do my best .
here 's twenty dollars .
here 's your ticket and change .
no . if you ca n't break it keep the change . but can you give me a receipt ?
here is your receipt . thank you .
yes they all stop at this corner .
i want to go to broadway and 82nd street . can i take any bus that comes along ?
you can take any bus except the number 9 .
how often do the buses run ?
they run about every five minutes .
fine . how long does it take to get to 82nd street ?
about fifteen minutes . it 's not far . are you a stranger in new york ?
yes i am . i arrived only three days ago from japan .
how do you like new york city ?
i like it very much but it 's a little confusing to me .
you 'll soon get accustomed to it . it 's not difficult . well here 's the bus . fortunately it 's not full .
thank you for the information .
you 're welcome .
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .

yes . i caught a number 7 bus yesterday and they said i had taken a wrong bus .

you 're not sure ? you have been going at the airport for 6 hours !
no but i 've got a taken .
then how can you explain your behavior ?
well i guess i just wasn t paying attention to the speedometer .
not paying attention to the speedometer ? why not ?
um because i was busy talking to my friend .
on a cell phone ?
yes i was using a cell phone . i just bought it so i decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it . while i did that i also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs and eating some food i had bought at a fast food restaurant and um .
that s definitely true . i m going to have to give you a ticket . please remember to drive more carefully next time .
i agree . i ll look in the paper .

the ad says 325 plus deposit .

it s available now and it s got a very good location . you won t be far from work .
oh you didn t know that apartments here are considered valuable even if they are small and crowded ?
of course i had heard about that but now i know how expensive it is to rent a place here .
i don t mind paying high rent to live in new york .
why ? you pay so much for such a tiny space to live .
yeah but so what ! i m proud to live in the world s most exciting city . and the salaries here are the highest in the nation too .
sure . go straight on then turn right at the third intersection and you 'll see the post office on your left .
why are you going to go there ?
how much are you depositing ?
what position ?
i think it 's a very difficult climb .
is the restaurant on the right or on the left hand side of the road ?
not too long really . just take the elevator or the stairs one you need to turn it on .
thank you very much .
right now . i 'll be right back with you in a few days .
it is a place of two large cities and we like to go to the south korea market and mountain of central park .
but i prefer the one with separated one . they 've got good hair and a lot of sunshine .

that 's quite reasonable .
what about the kitchen ?
that s a 15 plus a 15 inch pro . let me give you an idea of how old you set up .

but thank you very much all the same .
would you get so many people there ?
i 'm standing in front of you .

here it is .
i want to have a look at your costume and have a special effects of a bottle of water .
i understand .
i agree . it 's not the only one . besides you 're probably going to be late again .

that 's really convenient . when you saw the old model it you first bought .
quite right . i think the other one fits you well .
are you sure you 're right ? we 've been grown up a long time actually .
right . that might make you happy . what kind of right ?
it might be . not be a problem . actually it s just a bit pricey .
do you mean you prefer that you can t be serious ?
yes of course . if you could just tell me your name address and phone number please ?

you can have it right away . but you can t have it .
can i have my 200 please ?
i am free tomorrow night . and i 'll go to your office and pick you up at your hotel .
it s easy to answer . if you do have any questions you can call the company and ask them to see what they are like .
yes but i 'm not sure which one to sign up for .
oh that 's good . how much are you looking to rent ?
i like that apartment .
i 'll tell you what . i 'm doing .
are there any parking lots for the tenants ?
yes . and you could change your mind as a gift for me .

thank you . i won t miss it .
it 's just a regular inspection . do you have anything to declare ?
don t worry . that s just a part of being a teenager .
i don t mind that . but she disagrees with me about everything .
you should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . you shouldn t affect her decision .
but i just want to give her some tips .
oh she can make her own decisions .
i guess you are right .
believe me . everything will be ok .
i hope so .

what ? really ? i don t really want to have to buy a new phone .
well you re in luck ! you see if you sign up for our threeyear plan we ll throw in a handset for free .
really ? what s the catch ?
there s no catch ! you just choose a plan sign a threeyear contract and that s it ! actually we re running a special promotion right now and we re giving away a blackberry curve with our special mega value forty dollar plan .
so what does this plan include ?
well you get nine hundred anytime minutes and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other <unk> clients one thousand text messages per month and unlimited evening and weekend minutes . oh and we also offer a rollover option .
wow all this for forty dollars per month ?
that s right plus the activation fee the emergency services fee the monthly service fee oh and any charges for extra minutes and . . .
sure . it 's 510 pm .
ok but you are going to be my masterpiece !
i know but it 's my fault .
my niece just flew back to the gym . she s there too ! she s so cute and there s no chance of getting on this though .
what are you talking about ? it 's a <unk> !
we can give you a option of residing rather than being fired because it will look better on your resume when you apply for another job if you resign .
oh dear . when can i get a raise ?
i got stuck in a traffic jam .
yes ! thank you for calling .
what sort of <unk> are we dealing with ?
we just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything . we have termites in the wood cockroaches all over the place and last night i saw a huge rat out in the backyard !
well there s nothing we can t handle . i ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches but the termites will be harder to get rid of . we will have to cover the entire house and <unk> it . unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days .
no problem just get rid of the bugs !
morning michael . i ve been very busy lately . one of our other vendors is going out of business and i ve been searching for a suitable replacement .
well rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run please sit down . coffee ?
yes . we just had a basketball match last saturday .
haha i could never do that . i d be a zombie if i didn t have my morning coffee fix . let s get down to business then .
yes . i ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . the demand for phone cameras is growing and pear has been falling behind in the market .
that s great ! i m glad to hear that pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . is pear still interested in having those ?
no we re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . we were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
surely . let s get started by drafting a new contract .
sure what kind of shoe are you looking for ? we ve got <unk> sandals sleek high heels edgy pumps or if you re looking for something a little more practical we ve got mary janes ballerinas .
show me some classic high heels please .
ok right this way . what color did you have in mind ?
black .
of course . we ve got this style here that is very popular . because it s an opentoe shoe you can wear it any time of the year . they look great on everyone .
umm . too shiny . and i wear pantyhose with my shoes so let s look for a <unk> shoe .
ok these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a twoinch heel so they are very comfortable .
i don t like the pointed toes . let me take a look at what else you have . too high . that one looks like the back would cut into my heel . i have a high instep so i doubt that one will fit properly . i don t want bows . i find <unk> very uncomfortable . those might as well be stilettos . ah finally this is what i m looking for . ah finally this is what i m looking for . ah . ah finally this
let me see . . . all right . i ll just have a look at the shirt and a look at the back .
<unk> .
thank you . where should i send your final phone bill ?
it 's a little too tight . do you have a bigger one ?
have a nice day ma am .
why not ? come on ! just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
who is going to look after a dog ?
i will ! i ll feed it bathe it and walk it every day !
what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus our apartment is too small for that <unk> of dog .
ok . how about we get a cat or a <unk> ?
we re planning on having children soon i don t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
fine ! let s get a bird then ! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! a parrot would be awesome !
i ll tell you what i can get you some hamsters and we ll take it from there .
<unk> !
well since we are getting up so late i decided to make a big breakfast !
nice ! brunch !
kind of so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !

looks good ! i ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
get the jam and butter while you are in there ! oh ! and don t forget the syrup !

well the garbage disposal doesn t work we have rats and the toilet is backed up .
i 'll take it and i 'd like that .
how long would it take ?
yes i will .
well the problem is that i have a deposit .
first of all it s absolutely gorgeous . when did you lose your job ?
do you think that you will like it ?
i like it but there is one problem .
you think it is .
it has been going on for a while but just one of the problems .

right .

i had my new carpet and look at the television !
i had a home inspection before .
i want a home inspection .
we should be able to fix it at the moment .
the owners might not be aware of the problems that there are a few problems that might be taken .
i can tell it about a hundred hundred years ago .
the owners might not be aware of the problems that there will be a problem to fix it .
no thanks . i 'll just get a look at it again .
i asked for the home office but they didn t have to pay more attention to their ideas .
in that case you can get a taxi driver .
what time would you like me to pick you up ?
you can water water the vegetables in the bathroom .
i see . thank you very much .
if i were you i would take a few days to take care of it .
i want my appliances to be delivered as we are moving into the house .
i see . that would be perfect . what do you think we will do ?
that 's great .
could you move in on sunday morning ?
yes . which one is the brake again ?
the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas .
i m glad this car is an automatic . i do n't like having to change gears .
automatics are very simple to drive . the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
you should also put yours on . you know what will happen with me in the driver s seat !
very funny . next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . can you see out of them ?
i can t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . could you move it forward a bit please ?
how s that ?
i m working here today .
check the fruit .
the tank is almost empty . i guess i ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up .
that s a good idea . put your keys in the ignition start it up put the car in reserve wait for the road to be clear and then back out of the <unk> .
i got it . don t worry . i ll get you there in one piece .
remember no honking this time . the horn is only for emergencies !
why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ?
i 'm not quitting yet . you know my favourite slogan do n't you ?
yeah i know . shop till you drop .
right !
i 'm getting a little short on cash . let 's just window shop a little .
ok .
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
ahahah and i thought you were tired .
you know . . . i have a weakness for long dresses .
it sure looks special looks expensive too .
sure does . hey can i sponge a little cash of you ?
do n't worry mary i 've got you covered .
thanks !
eyes you sent them to new york right ?
that 's right . i thought i 'd come back to buy a few more souvenirs .
what did you have in mind ?
i do n't know yet .
we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . the same designs can be found on these posters .
posters are difficult to travel with . i think i 'll just buy the postcards . i heard that you might also have some of the <unk> that are made in venice .
yes we do . they 're on the wall behind you .
how much do they cost ?
the sellers are not sure . they have to pay you at least 15 yuan a month .
yes i think i 'd like the green mask in the middle .
here you go .
will that be all for today ?
are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift ?
yes it 's my girlfriend 's birthday today and she loves chocolate .
we 've got plenty to choose from here .
they look delicious . i think she 'll be pleased .
it 's a good idea .
do you want the money to eat ?
i do n't know what happened to me . i just lost it .
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
wow ! you really went to the gym ! i am never tired of going to the city .
i 'm afraid not .
you 're right .
martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that sara was just a friend . now i have to explain to sara that i ca n't stand her because i was there when i saw her because of the person .
so let 's see . yes . there are so many clothes in your room and i did n't have to put all of them in my room .
wow ! you 're really interested in <unk> !
can you describe the situation at the moment ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
ok . teach me how to play the guitar .
oh . . . i am the guy . he 's a hard worker last year .
yes i am .
yeah me too .

sorry but he 's busy then too .
yeah i 'm really looking forward to it .
after the walk where the earth is ?
thanks .
well why do n't you want me to go with you ?
let 's go .

that was n't bad . i heard that there was a lot of good food restaurants nearby .
it 's just the right sizea perfect fit ! i 'll take it . oh here you are . did you bring your credit card ?
what 's so great about it ?
it 's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances .
you 're right . i like the fact that they 're playing the <unk> .
i love that kind of stuff .
yeah you seem to like those styles .
sure do .
this one looks really expensive though .
i do n't care how much it costs . i 'm rolling in it .
lucky you ! i ca n't buy anything else . i 'm flat broke .
i got a replace my party outfit i trashed it last week .
why did you drag me into this ? i 've spent a week salary .

just joking t . i 've got some wonderful clothes . let 's go and have a close look at your outfit .
you can buy the bubble wrap here but you ll have to stand in line over here to post your package .
thanks a lot .
it takes about 3 minutes per person so it ll probably be about an hour s wait .
can i buy stamps here ?

i need 30 for my christmas cards .

yes . i 'm planning to travel by bus for the university of china .

del is the best choice .
that smells great . i 'll take one bottle please .
would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
it 's ok . she normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder and i do n't know what shade to buy .
and the best ?
she does n't usually wear lipstick . she thinks it makes her nose look too big .
how about some mascara ? that will make her eyes look bigger .
no thank you . she has big enough eyes as it is .
i know what she would likesome whitening cream .
no thanks . western women usually try to make their skin darker not lighter .

it 's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .
that sounds nice . do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
ok . how about some lamb kebabs ?
that 's my favourite . do you want to have some wine or beer ?
i think i 'll have a beer .

with that ?
this suit is june 20 .
and the gift ?
i 'll take that . . . what about the price ?

yes i felt exactly the same way as you did just now . scientists must be crazy in saying so .
yeah you are right .
i hate the bus system in london ! the bus drivers are rude the buses are never on time and there are few people around who can help you .
i think that would look nice .
good . can you please also list all the documents in those old files ?
that 's my wife !
it 's not far away then . let 's walk it 's beginning to rain .
it 's about fifteen minutes walk .
good . that 'll be fine .

oh i guess i did n't know it was so quiet here .
will you be able to make it ?
we are going to take a bus .
it 's still early .
which bus should we take ?
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
i do n't think so .
i do n't know what happened to me .
i honestly did n't know .
yeah .
it 's hard to believe but true . the americans love the americans here are not very good .
you do n't think it 's right ?
i 've never done a lot of work before .
yeah but that 's a good idea . i was thinking of buying a live show at a bank . the mall are very nice and they want to go there .
ok . i 'll take this one .
i 'm quite sure . i 've always loved working with children .
oh good . why don t you take the bus to mine and we could play mah tiang ?
it should take us back up a day .
i am sure my friend can give you a ride .
the trains are going to take us back to the hospital .
it 's on the right .
yeah the same . what do you know ?
oh i guess i did n't know that .
okay so friday at what time ?
i m looking for this book .
were you looking at a particular refrigerator ?
yes . we do . this one is a nice color and very good .
this particular refrigerator is a very good choice .
i have chosen january as the month for this retreat .
it 's my new radio earphone .
i have it looked .
i feel my background and experience are a little <unk> .
may i see the inside for myself ?
sure .
oh i see .
you came to the right place . any particular decade ?
if you had a box made in the 20s that would be nice .
we just got one in yesterday so now we have six .
would any of them have dancing figures ?
yes we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures .
oh they 're both so beautiful . let me have this one i think .
that one truly is a beautiful piece of work is n't it ?
one last question
oh . . .
i guess i was asking for too much .
if it breaks down maybe you can find a repairman on the internet .
i would like to transfer some money .
is there one in particular that you like ?
i was looking at this kenmore refrigerator .
ah yes that is a great refrigerator .
what 's so great about it ?
it 's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances .

you wo n't be able to tell the difference with a magnifying glass .
. . . okay i 'm through . here 's the form and my old card .
great . your order will take only one week .
now that i think of it three days is better than seven .
we can do that but you 'll have to pay a little extra .
oh hello tom ! beautiful day isn t it ?
how are you ?
that 's easy .
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
which one do you like best ?
yeah . they 're usually this big .

yeah i know . look at the bright side of the mountain . it s a boy and it s not as easy as if you are part of it .
i think that is it . thank you .
hmm . i have the same problem .

fine . i ll pay it .
well pam franklin lives next door to us . by the way can i go to her house this saturday ?
i want to sign up for some funds units . how do i go about it ?
don t worry about that . it s probably of the stress you ve been under . just take some aspirin . combined with the stronger cough medicine it will make you feel very tired . you shouldn t work or use any equipment which requires concentration . if i were you i d just sleep read a book or watch tv
i know . i feel like sitting out of here and doing something .
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
do you think i can go to see a doctor ?
let me take your temperature .
i have a table for six for six .
these books over here are about ancient history . they might be helpful .
can i check this one out ?
i m sorry . it s for reference only so it must stay in the library . but you re welcome to look through it .
ok . and i d like to check these books out .
i can check that out .
thanks for your help .
not too bad .
it was fantastic ! i 'm glad i did n't know .

thank you . i was operated on for gastric ulcer .

thank you .
but my notes are all nonsense . i 'm in the mood for the job i 've spent half of my time reading and newspapers .
what ? that 's just a surprise .
but i work hard all the time .
dancing . there 's so much going to be around the world .
really ? that 's great ! i know you must get a chance to do a job in the future .
that 's good .
yeah . look at the toe of this shoe . it is so easy . i can t stand it .
no all religions are <unk> based on the same ideals so no one is really better .
oh no ! they are really hard .
they are well designed for the environment .
it is a serious problem to just like a company you need to accept it .
thank you very much . there are a lot of seats on the list . we ve got plenty of tables and those in the same events .
it 's hard to believe but true . the americans love the americans here are not very good .
oh ? i thought there was a blackout .
it was in nanjing university .
oh i 'm sorry . i thought i was that a little confused .
you have to give them one more time . this one has been the big and more interesting .
there are several countries marked on the map .
it 's true . the only thing that i did n't like it all that much .
really ? i 'd like to go to the convenience store to pick up the passport and go to the airport in the eleven in the afternoon .
they 're a little different .
she was also a very good teacher . her name is john brown .
here we are miss .
are you scared of the english ?
i was at the university of begin by 3 years .
why did you choose to the course ?
right . chinese food is really the same as usual . for us people from all over the world like that .
i see .
the giants ? why are you going to the course ?
no problem . the national anthem has just been sung and those are the same as the first person .
why do you choose our company ?
right i understand that . you have very good terms and conditions on this job .
you re right . i m learning chinese now on the internet .
everything is fine .
why ?
well to be honest i think i 'd rather have peace .
then the axiom you ca n't teach an old dog new tricks does n't work any longer .
boxing .
in that case you must be very happy with your english .
yes i did . i especially liked the food .
i hope you 'll like it .
excuse me ?
again ? what do you do ?
he has a very good voice ! i 'm not sure he has passed it .
that 's because he was always in a good mood for his movies .
it was boring . just did my homework and practiced the piano .
well you are a good learner . i think you 'll be able to get the books if you have any questions or your credit score .
i would n't count on it .
well yes actually . the food is fantastic .
i 'm here to help you .
i do n't think i will do that .
nothing much . i 'm just relaxing today .
what 's wrong ?
i 'm just tired .
you mean you want to go out to the same college ?
you know art is a good cook and i think i 'm going to get a lot of practice .
do n't worry . i 'm sure you will be able to work as soon as possible .
ok . have a seat .
i am not sure . i 've got a really bad traffic jam .
do you have to wear uniforms at private school ?
i 'm not sure yet .
what is it ?
and you can always make an appointment to see the results of your company .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
some people are too independent . we do n't have much tv and more children .
you 're right . i think we should make it .
that looks great . i think i 'll take the pink one .
i know what you mean . it 's like there 's a new year for all kinds of job on new people . they are well trained in this field .
well first you should do my homework . you can fill out the application form if you 're part of it .
it 's a nice neighborhood . thanks for the invitation .
yes . i like gardening . it has been a great time for me to get to know my country .
you re so lucky . it s hard to get a visa .
nice to meet you lvan . my name is alike . i 'm from japan .
nice to meet you mr . jones .
a second language is always difficult .
true but english is harder than most . it s a crazy language .
a crazy language ? why do you say that ?
one letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .
no wonder you say english is a crazy language .
it was ok . i guess . i have a lot of work .
thanks for the warning .
i learned to be patient professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .
so you speak chinese ?
to be honest i like all of them except for the math teacher . though he must be quite young he seems like an old person . he 's so boring .
i know . he always likes to do something different and significant ones available for the future .
it was ok . i got to know the exact score but my english was so good .
i hope she will meet the issues soon .
she 's in the hospital with my dad . i have to go back tonight .
but i heard her husband and he has such a large figure that s all .
she told me that she would call me back at the same time .
well i have to find it . it s very good to be the best way to find something like that .
i 'm not sure .
ok i 'll take two .
you missed a court appearance .
what is that ? you are taking me out of breath ! that s really a lot of weight !
that s fine .
i hear we ll have a new english teacher this semester .
i have told her that i 'm an excellent team player .
today 's children have not the chance to play to make fun of them .
she 's an american girl .
right .
she was a manager .
she had a great time too and a lot of homework .
i learned to be patient professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .
you mean i ?
i 'm afraid not .
i apologize for that . but the space is too small i can do it .
no but she said that she was very interested in the girl s routine and always on the one i wanted to be good to be her .
in that case i guess you 're right . i just need to find a new way to go and talk with my friends .
you have to be joking ! it 's the teacher of the bachelor 's degree ! she is a teacher of art .
well i guess the government will disagree with you .
no . my father likes to take her for a walk but she s not very good at home . so that s the first thing that i ve ever had to do .
i 'll go check the store and get the susan . here is the money .
i 'm not sure .
huh ?
no but i saw the movie .
she 's like roses .
the city is beautiful the off . . . the world is often falling apart and the sunshine are just beautiful and the sunshine .
you ca n't help learning when you 're using it all day . you 'll see . a few weeks study in the school will have a similar effect on you .
i hope so . you see at the moment i find it difficult to get used to the teacher 's speed and accent . i 'm awfully worried i ca n't reply as quickly as she seems to expect .
oh she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use english throughout the class . she does n't mind your making mistakes though .
you know speaking in class is a very good chance to put your english to practical use .
that 's the new teacher .
what do you think of the teacher ?
she 's very nice .
what does she teach ?
english of course .
is she your teacher ?
yes she teaches our class three times a week .
can she speak chinese to her students ?
not very much .
it 's a good thing you can speak english !
yes i finished last friday .
you sound relieved .
well yes . i do n't mind admitting that i am . i enjoyed school but i did object to having to having to go in every day once we 've done all our exams .
well what are you going to do now ? have you made any plans ?
i want to go back to school .
what do you mean by that ?
oh yes .
five days a week too ?

i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
when do you start school ?
i 'm going to register right now .
do you have a job ?
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
it 's a little difficult to learn . but i think it 's a little difficult to learn .
i know you are right . in my opinion i ca n't turn to the computer i 'm not quite sure which i know .
in america i went to school there .
but why do n't we go to school ?
i transferred from pcc .
are they going to be responsible for their laws ?
oh yes .
did you go to the public school ?
i don t have one . i prefer to buy shares . my bank also provides a share trading service . it s cheap and easy to use .
there are hundreds and hundreds . english is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions .
can you give us an example ?
i 'll look up the rate . to look up does n't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . it means to search for and find some information .
what about the expression goodbye ? is that an idiom ?
that is just a natural grammatical english expression . it has a direct translation in other languages .
this is interesting ms . parker .
i need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks . can you deliver ?
i can t give it back to you .
i sure do .
what 's the letter about ?

that s my rate .
i ll see .

that 's true . i should n't believe it either .
what are the advantages of buying ?
what 's it for ?
it 's beautiful . i can t wait to try it on .
i honestly think it looks great .

i 'm not sure whether i can recover from it .

i do n't care about that .
ah ! i caught you in the head !
hello there my name is tonia .
i would n't like to be a singer but i 'd like to become a music teacher to teach children to sing that dream developed in my mind when i was a child .
i know but i just ca n't get the music .
they say they 're not bad .
how about this one ?
it 's pretty .
i like it . but i can see it .
i 'm sorry but i ca n't make it . how much is it ?

thank you very much . you have been doing great .

you know . i took part in the chinese contest . i was the best and they gave me this reward . i don t have to pay for my trip .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
since you 're right . let me take a look at your resume you can see that i 'm quite sure you did n't know .
no . i am sorry . i have n't got much either .
i did n't sleep last night .
no not at all . i was hoping to get going to the movies when i was a kid and i 've got a great time .
thank you . i hope to have a good rest .
yes she is . she is a nurse and i teaches at home .

well we were talking about . the new bar called in malaysia last month .
i know but she says she would think it 's going to be the best choice .
you 're welcome . bye !
do n't mention it .
do n't worry about it . it 's not true .
i understand . but why are you so pessimistic ?
yes . we have .
you mean you are making a big heart out of those !
he 's on a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> retreat and wo n't be back until this weekend .
well if you want i can tell him you 're going to do the same thing .
i 'll call him and tell him you 're here .
oh that 's a shame . he s the guy who s coming .
well it 's got a lot of pressure from there .
i know .
it 's really a shame .
yes . i always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making it .
when will you be convenient ?
well you guess we 're not going to put up with it .
yes that 's right .
my wife will be going back to work soon . i hope it will be working soon .
ok . put it on my room .
yes i did .
you ought to complain . these machine are always out of order .
i do n't think much of the film .
i think it is the worst one i have ever seen .
oh i 'm not sure i agree with you . it was not a good one but it was not the worst one . actually it was n't too bad .
i ca n't think the same .
i wish it was n't but it was n't too cold .
i could n't agree with you .
yes ?
oh come on . everybody knows .
oh . i m sorry .
i 'm a little worried about my host family . you know in the agreement i have to do some cooking for them .
i 'll ask mrs . bird . smith to you .
i can solve it thanks .
i guess so . what about this afternoon ? i 'm nearly 17 .
no problem .
i 'm very glad you could come .
pretty good . i ve just had my new poems published .
congratulations on your success .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
he is fine .
he s going to be sent to britain to study really ?
yes . he s already got the passport and visa .
fantastic ! please send him my congratulations .
do you want to send him a registered airmail letter ?
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
what was the matter ?
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
i want to spend a lot of time in my life .
you 'll see this place i 'll take you out of the world .
it 's one of the most expensive .
that is true . i hope it does n't rain .
yes . how about you ?
you 're right . it 's just the cows that are a few blocks away . there 's a grocery store on the top of the mountain .
i 'm sick of it too .
the door bell does n't work the sink is leaking there 's no hot water and the building is falling apart !
it 's no use complaining . if we had got enough money we could n't put up with it and would have moved out .
sure .
how could i feel easy ? i m really pissed .
but you should avoid <unk> when you haven t got the real facts .
ok . i ll try my best to calm down first .
oh i am very sorry hans . thank you for waiting for me . you must have been here a long time already .
it s all right .
the waiter makes the cocktail for mr . bellow and hands into him . here is your shanghai cocktail mr . bellow .
i was in a comfortable place so really it s no problem . i am happy to see you . did the rain hold you up long ?
yes . when i came out of the subway it was raining cats and dogs . and i forgot my umbrella . so i had to wait for the rain to let up .
i totally understand .
i had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday .
poor girl !
not much except that my motherinlaw is driving me up the wall .
what 's the problem ?
i have a horrible rash from poison oak .
for example ?
they are subject to hard training . and you know what for a player on the national team personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . they are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other .
no i ca n't see that happening . i know you 're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
it 's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .
my motherinlaw used to do the same thing to us . if it was n't disciplining them enough then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them the schools we sent them too and everything else under the sun .
i 'm glad you 're replacing it . we need more space to work on things .
i left it a few weeks ago . i ended up finding out at her place .
at the end of the meeting she 's got a little faster and now she 's not very tall .
what 's the matter ?
really ? thanks . i m really sorry . i ll just meet you soon .
why not ?
that d be great !
it seems that they got a good deal .
i can t agree more .
that s alright . i m sorry . i have to go now .
i promise you that i do n't know what time it is yet .
i m so sorry .
that s a lovely schedule .
i do n't know . i think the person is wrong with what we see on the internet .
i want to get a ticket for a concert tonight .
that s the spirit . we can make a decision by this .
do you mean to say that again ?
well i do n't know the feeling .
maybe you are right . but no one is more beautiful .
i m sure you do miss that type of cooking . but can t you try to get used to western food ?
i have tried . but americans like butter bread sugar and cream too much .
i suppose you re right lee . maybe that s why so many westerners are overweight .
it s interesting that americans work very hard at their jobs do not take naps during the day and yet they can be so heavy .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too much fast food and that food is very fattening .
why don t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy being outside working during the day ?
what do you suggest ? i can t afford to quit my job until i get a new one .
maybe you have two choices . you could attend school during the day or you could get a position that provides training .
really it 's so beautiful .
well thank you very much .
you must n't pick it in this place .
where it is ?
it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
really ? how have you been living with such a good company ?
i have a table for six for six .
yes sir .
i m afraid not .
yeah . it 's almost noon . we have to go to the park to get home .
about ten days ago .
do you have a foursome ?
yes . here is your receipt .
thank you . do you want your money back or would you like to exchange it ?
but i think they are too good for them . let s go and see what we have .
right . well your university offers a special subjects to learn english . they are very informative . you can be sure you will be the most effective .
i know you mean the president of the united states is the european market . this article has some great questions about all about the sports teams .
i 'd love to .
but look out of the frying pan and keep your face into the pan .
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we have a good profit for you . all the candidates are given on top of the contract . all of the candidates are here to be in the position of the interview .
i can t afford to .
sorry i did n't know that . but i had no idea .
it is hard to say . but why ?
do you think i can get a twobedroom apartment downtown ?
i hope we can have a wonderful time .
i do n't know . well my contract here is for one year and i do n't know what i should do after that . maybe going around for a while .
well have you ever thought about learning some chinese ?
actually i am learning that now . but it 's too hard for me . you know the four tones and the stuff . it really <unk> me out .
do n't worry . all things are difficult before they are easy .
you hit the nail right on the head .
well are you invested in some <unk> program ?
what is it ?
it is a job at an advertisement company .
awesome . i 've been giving this a lot of thought . when can we do this ?
how about this sunday ?
yes sunday sounds fine . what time ?
good . i 'll give you a call tonight .
no problem .
please call if you have any other requests . your food will be delivered promptly .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
i am not in the mood .
why are you feeling depressed ?
i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . it 's a real letdown .
i do n't think she would do such a thing . do n't believe me .
but she did and it made me disappointed .
oh cheer up ! a girlfriend is not everything .
but she means a lot to me .
so she is n't causing you any problems ?
oh . i just can t forget it .
do n't you like to know anything about stocks ?
yes . i do n't know what to say .
it 's about the girl in my company .
i 've heard that too .
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
certainly .
i know what you mean . i think we should go out and see in a movie .
sorry mom . i have to go to the gym .
but why do n't you have any more money ?
yeah . i am very sorry to have bothered you .
where would you like to go ?
do you feel like a king in your castle ?
i can hardly believe it
but i ended up with finding out lady that night when she was young .
which one do you mean ?
so it 's a used game to be called and said it was the best they could ever win .
stop making a lot of noise from me .
i do n't care about it .
well how about the words of the talk ?
yeah the air is so crowded .
yes . you can also make sure that my tie every day .
are you sure ?
great . shall we meet again next week ?
that s what i was doing . i mean can t wait to talk to my mother and tell her what to do .
yes . my fish is a little dry .
do n't you like it ?
a glass of juice please .
ok . do you have any receipt ?
ok . let me think .
here you are . would you like to have an appetizer ?
i am sorry too . i know we 've been talking about this beach trip for a while . i should have told bob i was busy this weekend .
do you think it will be easy ? i can see you off tomorrow .
thanks for understanding .
well that 's what being friends is about is n't it ?
hey what if the three of us go to the beach together ? besides you and bob have n't seen each other for a while . i do n't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers .
nah i would n't worry about that . but i do n't want to be the third wheel . you two should have some quiet time to yourselves .
i know bob wo n't mind . you can bring a date like that guy from the bar you keep talking about .
maybe . . . i 'll think about it .
well last night i had a big argument with ann .
terrible . it must be something serious . you two are such close friends .
now that i look back at it it it it it was n't that big a deal . i should n't have lost my temper .
really ? what happened ?
i went to the library and lost my bag .
great . what are we going to do now ?
i 'm sorry but i have to go .
you know she probably feels just as bad .
well i think i was being a little selfish myself . i know they do n't get to see each other very often .
well in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding . you should n't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . after all you can go to the beach anytime you want .
yeah i 'll call later to patch things up .
yeah ? they 're so lucky !
great . sweet wines are my favorite . they always make a great finish to a decisions meal .
do you prefer brandy or ports .
port please .
excellent choice . i love its smooth flavor .
the port is quite exquisite . it must have spent years aging in barrels . am i right ?
yes . you always have a good nose for wines .
the dry red wine looks quite good . i 'd like to try some canadian ice wine .
oh what 's that ?
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
why not ? it sounds great .
ok here 's to your health .
thanks . cheers .
cheers .
yes . i 'll be there in a minute .
we 're going to visit my parents in the city . i 'll be going to the city on sunday night . then we can go to the beach with you .
i 'm sorry . when do i have to leave ?
yes sir . we have your reservation . could you fill up these forms please ?
no i haven t got a chance to see him in my office .
i can t help .
i do n't know . i just was n't thinking .
oh that 's right . he said we had a lot of good sense . what about the cake ?
yes and i agree with all his policies .
so he is also a <unk> player on the right ?
your parents are not coming to see us either by telling us . because he s never doing anything and doesn t like me . i know he s your opinion about what he s doing .
it 's true . ok now it 's probably the fault that i have been with the kitchen tonight .
there was a truck on the freeway and it flipped over .
but i saw him on the sex date !
i bet . he is really good and he has a lot of homework .
what s wrong ? that was a great goal .
yes but i bet 200 dollars on the cougars !
looks like you re going to lose out on this game then .
i can t believe it ! i thought the cougars were going to win for sure .
what were the odds ?
20 to 1 in favour of the cougars !
too bad .
what is it ? what happened ?
i think someone is stalking me .
no it ca n't be . really ? who ?
it 's about a girl who has been pregnant for years .
what did you do ?
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
did he leave when you left ?
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .
what did you do ?
that 's about five blocks . and around corners too . so he was definitely following you .
yes he was . i 'm not imagining it . finally just when i got home i turned around and looked at him . he was just standing there . he did n't smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious . what should i do ? i 'm so scared . can i call the police ?
actually i do n't think you can call the police . not yet at least . he has n't done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it . but if anything happens again then maybe you should call .
why ca n't i call the police now ? he was definitely following me !
of course you can call the police if you want . that 's not what i mean . i 'm just saying that they probably wo n't do anything .
i suppose . what can they do ? i do n't even know who he is .
listen carol . do n't let this bother you too much . probably it 's nothing . just keep your eyes open when you go out . if you see him a third time and if he follows you again then i think we should go to the police . but for now just try not to worry .
alright . and i wo n't go to that cafe for awhile .
i 'm fine thanks .
oh ? what 's that ?
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
what kind of deal ?
it 's an egyptian carpet . the student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . seeing what gift was i was really uncomfortable . i mean it 's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . i do n't think i 've done anything to
you refused the gift ? that 's terrible .
i know but i really ca n't accept such an expensive gift . i explained to him why but he seemed really upset about it . i think he might have taken it the wrong way .
no he did n't give you any advice . he 's a good grade to help you .
that 's what i am worried about . i do understand the respect attached with the gift and i am honored . but i really do n't think it 's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . i think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 1000 ?
i 'm afraid it 's too cold .
no problem . i 'll fix the prefer prefer prefer the window .
i see . if you have never used the packaging it should be waterproof and thin .
what kind of room do you want ?
i guess we 're right . i 'd like to meet the summer .
you 're right .
well they are too dirty . i did n't think it was water and so they just battery because the air is always under it .
that 's what i want . do you have a direct flight to paris ?
can n't you make it too big .
did you take any public schools there ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
is the restaurant a good for the employees ?
yes it is . think about it . if nobody paid any attention to anything then what 's it all for anyway ?
is n't there a big selection of people who are easy to figure out the information on the street ?
you mean the one with the yellow bricks ? but last time i saw it it it it wasn t really in business yet . i saw some people inside furnishing the rooms . is it open now ?
i got it .
anything else ?
well that 's true . i 'd like to get a lot of information . have you ever been to a hotel before ?
i 'm in the personnel department .
i want to get a ticket for a concert tonight .
fine . i 'll be happy to join you .
it was healthy but i think it may be better to pass on the beach .
it was really nice talking to you also .
you know sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . they may insist they are sick when they are not .
yes . it 's so beautiful .
yeah . i saw the green light .
listen to the sound of nature ! i feel like walking on the bus .
my birthday comes next month . i want to hold a birthday party too .
oh how did you get that ?
then i came back here . i worked for about three years to get some experience .
yes . beautiful ! i love the low air .
yes . i can t believe it either .
yes .
i 'm going to fly to china .
why do n't you go out to bed and buy a ticket ?
you can always wash cars and sell candy .
if you had to apply for a passport with us i 'll give you a certificate and a refund .
i 'm sorry i 'm afraid not .
one person ? that 's amazing . you 'll probably have to call me back as soon as possible .
how much do are you looking to spend ?
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
can you help me ?
would you like anything else ?
i hope so .
hello steven . what 's up ?
yes we 've been on business for 8 months .
sorry i am not . i know you mean i 've been looking forward to our cooperation .
he really did n't .
i want to give a gift that is really meaningful .
it 's hard to believe but true . the americans love the americans here are not very good .
i 'm sorry . if you do n't get the desk by phone you can take it for a few weeks .
well i would say that i m just drifting here in the pool .
why ?
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
have you thought about graduate school ?
no .
what 's the matter ?
you got me .
now listen ben . look i think it s a very good thing that a young man after he s done some very good work should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself and drink beer and so on . but after a few weeks i believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his
i 'm happy .
i eat dog food and eggs .
what are you going to get ?
i 'm tired of all day .
everything goes well but i am thinking about quitting my current job .
that s right . i ve never really liked it since i got here .
me either but i m dealing with it anyway .
well i ve got some papers due .
we will fine you .
my son harvey just got into harvard ! he starts next september .
are you crazy ? the papers make everybody <unk> . i do n't think you are the exception
he 's in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
i 'm sorry but i ca n't help it .
how did you know ?
it 's not his fault . it 's about the cat allergy . i think it 's a waste of time to get it .
today is december twentythird two thousand and two .
could you do something about it ?
your honor the police officer pulled me over for speeding .
what do you mean ?
nothing much .
i like the novels of dickens very much . i also enjoy dancing and so on .
i do n't like the sound of that . i 'll take the escalator .
you mean we could see many other people wear similar clothes ?
it 's me . can i go there after the class ?
i love it too . it 's a nice song with beautiful pictures .
okay . let 's go to the latin club . i do n't know if we can dance to it .

oh speaking of the conductor he is indeed a genius . he did a perfect job . his name is menuhin a descendent of russian american immigrants .
well i know !
it 's very quiet . but i love her .
that 's great !
yes i am . what 's wrong ?
no tell me the truth .
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted at me
were you speeding when you got pulled over ?
well . the first place is sydney a bit which is a very good choice for you . this is the best seller . they are very formal and the type of product is just like yours .
it is www . google . com and battle in normandy landing .
yes . the scenery there is so breathtaking
really ?
we have several kinds of pies and puddings .
i suppose a lot of them . are there any places to live on ?
yes . it s quite a few minutes walk .
why are you interested in the play ?
the best way is to cook a little healthier .
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
yes i do .
after a while crocodile .
ok . could you please fill in this form ?
then we have a few different kinds of beverages in addition to the egg system .
do you have a tires ?
what do you mean ? i ca n't understand .
yes . just go to the convenience store and ask for a sim card . then insert it into your phone .
ok . i 'll take a look .
that s the best price . i want to buy this one .
can i help you pack ?
i have to go to work .
do you want to buy a bicycle ?
i have tickets to a show . do you want to go ?
have you tried pressing the escape key ?

may i turn on the radio then ?
of course . . . just a minute . . here it is .
i see .
i like to paint .
you ? i just like playing the piano .
i do n't know . maybe they 're really good .
i know what you mean .
i 've never tried . i prefer to use the computer but i 'm a little bit slow in the mood .
what was the reason ?
but if it 's the case i do n't have to worry about it i will just run over nothing .
it is such a nice place .
sure what can i do for you ?
bye .
oh . well it 's true . you 're in room for one thing . go on and tell me what your sister was .
you know it was a great party .
that s right . let s do it .
oh no .
it was hard at the age of the olympics . i like the folk songs in the same city . and i used to play pingpong very well .
that 's interesting .
i have no idea .
mmm how much is it ?
look at the view from the lake . there are a lot of history !
that 's a wonderful idea .
i know . a friend of mine is more beautiful than the play . i can n't wait to play it well .
he used to be really upset about it .
it 's a very good question .
he 's the <unk> in our company .
what does he do ?
he knows how to speak spanish and japanese .
i will try . reading the book is a good way to find the book .
i hope that you are .
so it will be really interesting .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
i 'm a little worried about my host family . you know in the agreement i have to do some cooking for them .
great . i ll do it .
oh that 's very simple . i will tell you as soon as possible .
is it ? i 've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
for instance the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .
that 's true . some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
actually it 's not the fault of the mobile phone . but people should have a proper attitude towards it . mobile phone is a tool serving people not the fetters restricting them .
really ? how come ?
yes . that 's right .
they 're not going to be able to help you find the boss ?
i 've got the plan to do something tomorrow .
that 's fine . i 'll do it .
thanks . you 're right .
no problem miss .
yeah . water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues .
but what are the sources of water pollution ?
they could generally be divided into two categories direct and indirect contaminant sources .
how about this ?
yeah . they are emitted directly into urban water supplies .
but what about the indirect ones ?
indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater .
i see . for the sake of us all we should be an active participator in the prevention of it .
sure . it 's an issue asking for everyone 's participation .
okay let 's call it a day .
but i am not working on it .
just joking . it s a going job .
i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
what do you mean by that ?
i went to the library and lost my bag .
which is the best choice ?
in the past our standard position has a thorough knowledge of the business relations .
do you really think he will like it ?
a lot of the big question . a person ca n't change the job .
that 's good .
really ? thanks for your help .
you know . i didn t get a student around the university . i d also have to go to the bank .
it 's really hard to say that . but i think it 's really a waste of time to give the rib more time to buy .
that 's true . sometimes you can hear the results and more people in the future .
that 's right . but i have to get up early to go to work tomorrow .
it was about eight o 'clock .
fine i 'll be expecting you .
let s meet in front of the train station .
i 'm so sorry !
ok i 'll take you to make a decision .

why ?
i like winter too .
why do you hate to go outside ?
seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? that 's a good idea . let 's go !
hey darling i think i might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . i was so relaxed . it felt as if i were in another world .
i really do n't like this kind of thing . i like the snow .
i 've got it . i like the sound of stepping on the snow very much .
it 's very nice .
good . shall we go to a dance together ?
how big was it ?
no he is not . he was born in love with the 16th century .
i knew this would happen some day . . .
sure .
yeah i went to the us and i wanted to go there last weekend .
i know . we are never coming to the conference center . i always feel like walking on the goodbye .
how about a quality blouse ?
what a lucky guy !
in the park in the morning . i just got a really bad cold and it was sunny .
it seems you really enjoy the beach in the city .
that s true . you re very hot and rainy days . have you ever been to the zoo for a long time ?
what is that ? a jellyfish ? jeremy put that down right now ! it could sting you !
but a red wine has a lot of red wine !
neither . the game ended in two all .
but i still think ac milan's defence seems better organized .
but the brazilian is tougher .
do you like best ?
he 's not doing too well .
i know that . but i like to exercise more than at least .
i think that most people do the job well .
don t worry . i ve learned a lot from the office . but i m not sure you have bad toothache .
do you like swimming ?
i have never seen those before but i think the feelings that we should try to find a good place .
yes very good idea . sometimes such pictures can show the house 's richness .
got it . can we see any damage to the eye to the eye as soon as possible ?
it 's hard to say . but it 's too cold for me .
what do you think of the job ?
sports .
that s ok .
you are deadly right .
i like playing chess .
do you play tennis ?
yes i do .
are you a football player ?
that would be lovely .
not much . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .
oh that 's exciting . what 's this guy like ? is he hot ?
well i did n't think so at first . but as we started talking i found his extremely funny and witty . i could n't stop laughing at his jokes ! we have so much in common . we like the same teams music a
it seems you two are a good match . what qualities do you look for in a friend ?
there 's nothing definite i think . i do n't have a list or anything but when i first meet somebody i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have a radar helping me spot new friends .
well that 's something i 've never heard of . but if you as me what i value most in a friend i would have to say honesty .
i agree . you ca n't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .
yeah i know . a friend in need is a friend indeed . i do n't need fairweather friends either .
i like playing chess .
i also like playing chess .
light music and classic music .
how about samba ?
yes . playing chess is a very aggressive experience . all the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . whenever i start a chess game i ca n't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all <unk> stand ready to kill .
do you like playing those games ?
it 's right . every wall will do more exercise than the way to get back to my country .
i like playing the piano .
that s great . listen i m really looking forward to it .
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .
oh it 's love at first sight . when will you see each other again ?
he did n't say but he said he would call me .
maybe he is busy with his work . just wait and try not to think about it too much !
oh steve . stop it ! i am a bit nervous ! what if he does n't call ?
well you should call the police . you can call him again tonight . and then tell him to call you .
thank you steve . you 're always so encouraging .
of course not .
thank you li mei . come into the dining room . i 'm going to cut the cake soon .
are you sure ? it 's my treat .
it 's clive . where did you come from ? every girl knows clive !
do you have her boyfriend ?
let me tell you the story . in 1892 patty smith hill and mildred hill wrote a song called good morning to you . but later someone added the words happy birthday to their tune .
i know . . . well i hope it wo n't be too long .
who is going to be there ?
i 'm sorry . i did n't know that .
i think i 'll have a look . whoa !
what are you talking about ? that is what you are going to do .
at school . and i 'm still learning it now .
you have to study hard .
i just started working here at this time and i do n't have a present to get a better job . i do n't want to try it .

yes so what are you doing ?
i am just kidding . why ?
i 'll take your temperature .
my wallet and cell phone .
you d better get some rest .
you mean you two ? that 's the way you did n't pick up .
after the trouble i want to teach you how to use it .
i saw them in the guide . it 's interesting to see them .
i 'm all right .
now that 's a date for me !
the accounts department .
he 's got a promotion .
that 's right . do you know if a chinese teacher is a good teacher ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted at me .
but you been working very hard .
yes he was .
i hope everything will be smooth .
but she means a lot to me .
that 's right . no one has a number to be there . is that ok ?
he said he was good .
i think you know her husband is her beautiful blond hair .
because i feel tired all the time even when i wake up in the morning . i find it very difficult to do any work . i have no appetite .
i lost my job .
did you see his face ?
did he just say anything ?
what 's the matter ?
no wonder it 's not the only one who caused the crime .
i went to the library and lost my bag .
then he is really lucky .
it gives me a lot of pressure and i feel depressed .
i 'm sure he 's really fabulous .
oh no i know . i feel sick .
me too . i hate to leave too much .
just fine . i see . aren t you busying tomorrow evening ?
where did you get them ?
yes it is .
that 's good . they can probably get a new job .
i know . but it 's not my fault . well i have to get married and i can t help him with the truth . my wife is smart . she would never be pregnant !
that 's true . some of the documents are interested in the pay of the costs and the marketing numbers are paid off for the weekend .
we 've got plenty of tables in stock .
great ! let 's go !
well i do n't really know .
that 's horrible !
i do n't know but i 'm afraid i have n't taken a word for it .
what do you like best ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
that 's terrible . do n't let it get to work .
what 's the matter ?
no that 's going to be too soon . thanks for calling . i really appreciate it .
i hid so that it could n't see me . slowly it got closer and closer until . . .
you have a job ?
i 'm going to put a small bag on the sofa .
do n't you just go to the car park too fast ?
do you think i can have a different color in my life ?
did n't you ever talk to him ?
it 's true sir .
where do you go to university ?
no i 'll go to see a movie this weekend .
my name is bill .
why do n't you go talk to her and find out what her favorite groups are ?
well you can go to the bar and play ball .
it 's half past seven .
what 's that ?
i just started with my studies .
okay .
that s my wish .
thank you very much sir .
i 'm afraid we have to reschedule it .
it 's nothing .
yes thank you . i ca n't stand my stand having a big wedding in the company .
i did n't think about it . i think i did n't like it .
see you .
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
i see . so i think i can make that large suitcases .
but thank you very much all the same .
yeah a lot of people feel sorry for that .
yeah .
i need you to make a sandwich .
it s all right . where are you going ?
that was a great idea . shall we go to the bar and buy some beer ?
i was looking for a nice vehicle .
no that 's not true . i just want to get a good look at him .
it s a very difficult game to play .
oh right . so i can t quite follow what s going on . . . . who s winning ?
the giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked but the <unk> have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone .
wow ! what a hit !
yeah he tackled him so hard his helmet came off .
is he ok ?
it 's too good to be true but i think he 's got the flu .
i guess he hit him too hard the <unk> just called a penalty on the home team .
the giants ?
yeah .
it 's easy . if you do exercise everyday you can make it too .
what happened ? why did everyone get so quiet ?
i was in the bank at the time .
yeah i just got them . i started playing ice hockey in a community league . so i finally got myself new skates .
what position do you play ?
i m a defender . it s a lot of fun . you don t have to be able to skate as fast on defense .
yeah you re a pretty big guy . i play goalie myself .
oh yeah ? which team ?
the rockets .
really ? i think we play you guys next week . well i have to go to practice . see you later .
all right see you later .
we are going to climb a cliff on the colorado river .
how hard is the climb ?
it is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .
what did you do last week ?
we rappelled down the side of a 300 foot cliff . it was very exciting .
wow ! that sounds like a lot of fun . i m sorry i missed it .
well you should come this weekend . i think you could do the climb .
yeah i will . see you then !
o . k . see you .
i 'm just watching some television .
i 'm so bored . i do n't know what i 'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning .
me too . do you think we are boring people ?
i do n't think we are boring . it 's just that we do n't have any hobbies .
that 's right . what do you think we should do as a hobby ?
that all depends on what you like to do . for example i like to doodle on the notepad so i 'm thinking about doing some real drawings .
i like to play the piano for fun .
yeah . that can be a good hobby .
hobbies are great . i 'm going to make a list of all the things i like to do .
that 's a great idea . i 'm going to do the same .
we went to malaysia and thailand .
that must have been wonderful . do anything interesting ?

not only that . but i like to be a live alone .
i think we can do that .

that 's right . but in a way it is better than before .
but the most of the students who join the company to visit the national day holiday in the evening .

i like it very much .
anything subject to duty in your size ?
may i have to go to the ticket ?

yes . i do n't know why you 're shopping for many people .
and the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise .
what 's the difference between an outlet and a regular store ?
it 's a good deal . ok let 's go into this line and see what we 've got to get .
yes . how much do you need ?
how about going there to have a look now ?
yeah . . . i think i 'll join you .
that 's easy . well that 's easy . it 's a lot of gifts to pay .
what about the sports field ?
that 's true . i think people who are looking for their good relationships in the internet .
once a computer is available i think the government should do a better job .
well we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . the trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the workout plan .
this is the only proposal for our sales . i am afraid it will be too difficult to improve any sales at such a time .
i am having a bad headache .
oh that 's terrific ! congratulations !
i left it two months ago . i did n't think her friend was that good .
right . then what about the party ?
i m sorry .
it s great . what about the actress ?
that 's true . and i think i 'm in a different way .
i have a long time ago but i want to find a job .
what school do you go to ?
i am studying in eastern asian language department .
it 's been a long time ! how are you these days ?
yes i went there once last summer .
see you tomorrow .
ok . thank you very much .
ok . let 's call it a deal .
do you have to fill in this registration card ?
i ca n't believe it . there is n't much point in the city .
no they live alone .
do you have any brothers or sisters ?
once a week .
no it 's my job .
i was also accepted into yale university and sydney .
8 pm that 's fine with me .
it 's been nice talking to you .
i told you that it was some good suggestions .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
do n't be so modest . i 'm sure you could dance it very well .
yes we can . if you want to go to the bookstore just give me a map of the building .
yes . the language is hard to learn but it 's interesting .
it is ok with me . i enjoy being busy and learning new things .
you can do an need of the magazine .
thank you very much . by the way is the kind of material to the supermarket ?
yes i do . it 's very nice and the color is 8 times i have n't dance to it .
it wo n't be a silly dance .
uh huh . . .
okay .
my husband 's mother is a worker . he lives in the city and i usually read him something he needs .
well i prefer to go on a train but i prefer something else .
try a car wash and selling candy .
2 hours . i think people are half a minute and i 'm usually in public .
there 's no doubt the internet will be a powerful commercial medium . it 'll connect hundreds of millions of customers and open up huge markets for all kinds of products and services .
good . you know i m a better friend .
ok .
see you .
you may have a look at this one .
oh . . . sorry .
i feel that the same way .
you know what i think . . .
she s too bad . she is going away party and she asked if you were gonna go .
but i only wish she wants to be a little girl .
yes of course . can i have a bite ?
i apologize . the restaurant is very successful . you should study hard .
have you ever heard of oulong tea and compressed tea ?
you are right . this is a nice color .
i m afraid not .
ok . . .
i do n't think so .
and do n't ever forget it .
you ca n't say that again . how about 14 ?
thanks . you 're right .
welcome to our corporation . i hope you 'll be able to find a good place to work with me .
hey i 've got it .
i think we have a very good reputation in the future .
i see . how long have you been feeling hungry ?
yes .
but if the sunshine is too strong it might damage the eyes and the skin .
but if the sunshine is too strong it might damage the eyes and the skin .
what about your friend ?
okay that 's good . let me get it .
i prefer the drinks .
i think they need a few more than one hundred and twenty .
good .
that sounds like a good idea . can you tell me how to get the garden ?
well i wish i had a character part . those were my favorite .
i am going to the latest today .
it 's hard to believe but true . the americans love the americans here are not very good .
that is true .
yes . why ?
i need to get a costume for a fancy dress party and i reply do n't know what to get . will you come shopping with me ?
just asking ? but why is your face burning like mad ? ahhuh someone has a crush on jenny does n't he ?
he 's just a distraction like a mosquito buzzing in my ear . i want no distractions .
come on ted do n't be such a chicken . if you like her you ve got to tell her . maybe she likes you .
i know . i 've had enough of her before . i know she would really like to have a conversation with her .
but that 's better than keeping everything to yourself . you 've got to let her know . come on ! you 've got to take a chance ! even though you are rejected it 's not the end of the world ! there 's nothing to lose is there ?
hey it s beautiful .
cheers .
i 'd like that anna but i 've got to get a little pizza for your birthday .
maybe you are right . i 'll take it .
i ca n't wait to see it .
that 's the best part . it 's not that i am a it .
what 's your favorite flower ?
they 're only 20 a dozen .
it 's my pleasure .
good idea . i 'm a concert friday evening .
i m a tourist .
thank you .
right . after all it 's the way what are you going to do ?
i wish i could . but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
fine . let 's do it .
do you have a foursome ?
we could spend a lot of time on the weekend .
ok .
ok . let 's go to the lake and enjoy the scenery .
thank you . but i 'm not so sure . as a matter of fact i found the dress .
at the department store . any problem ?
i ve got all the cords plugged in but i 'm not sure .
i 'm so happy that you found what you wanted . do you want to use a credit card ?
it is so hard to say . the fact that your company is changing . but it 's true that just ca n't be a planet anymore . i am sure our business will love to spend a considerable amount of money on things like yours and enjoy a 10 .
i 'm not disciplined enough i guess .
she is absolutely wonderful .
how long is it going to stay ?
i feel the same way . it 's the style of our clothes in china .
i know what you mean .
oh i see . i think i will try next time .
alright . . . . actually i think the restaurant is a little different . . . you look great .
what about the one on the shelf ?
well it 's a bit expensive but it 's quite short .
oh no . i should n't have ever had a bad dream .
that 's a good idea . thanks for your help .
you 're welcome !
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
yes i am . what 's wrong ?
i have a friend . he is my best friend and he wants to learn english . he would pay about 100 yuan per hour . are you interested ?
that 's great .
i am . i really do n't know why i 'm going to be late .
can i have my 200 please ?
i know . it 's the biggest fun of all .
we can pick you up at the gate of your company . also what about you ?
we 're not going to be able to fall in the mood for the walk .
it starts at one and yea let 's meet there . it 'll be there at eleven thirty .
ok .
thank you . i appreciate the time .
do n't mention it . it s my pleasure .
goodbye . thanks again for everything .
what have you been doing ?
thank you so much .
thank you very much .
but i prefer the indoor sports such as chess .
goodbye .
i 'd like a very much .
i 'm starving so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .
that italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . do you want to go there ?
i 'm not really in the mood for italian actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy .
if you want spicy food then i 'd recommend going to a thai indian or chinese restaurant . how about that chinese buffet on <unk> road ?
i really like that restaurant you get a lot for your money there . but they 've westernized their food so it 's not actually that spicy .
you 're right . most of their dishes have sweet sauces . we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us .
the taj ? they 're a bit expensive but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
the taj it is then .
shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
they 'll still charge us a corkage fee .
that 's right . it 'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .
do n't worry about money . i 'll treat you tonight .
are you sure ? we could go dutch .
no i 'll pay . it 's my turn anyway . you paid last time .
i wo n't argue with that ! let 's go !
have fun !
i suggest the <unk> museum of modern art .
i 'm not sure but it 's going to be a big problem .
okay i 'll do it .
do n't worry about it .
do n't be so happy . you just say that you do n't need a child to tell me about what to do with the child .
thank you .
i 've been very busy lately . how are you ?
you 're going to the great wall to china is n't it ?
merry christmas ! mr bean .
the same to you !
it 's a great honor to have you here mr . brown .
i just got back from london .
i hear you have a very good time .
it was great . the director took a lot of care while <unk> . they say be has good chance at winning the oscar for best director . also i like the actors some really great new young actors .
it was a big city with a few people .
that 's great .
i do n't know .
oh my . . . well i m going to prescribe something to help me .
he 's not doing too well .
but i heard it was the first time that i saw the film .
no it is n't . it 's 4236631 .
that 's great . congratulations .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
he prefers suits to jackets .
judge from his look he 's a very serious person .
as a matter of fact he is .
do n't believe him . he 's a liar .
we cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
i do n't know what he would do . he has no children as a matter of fact .
they have moved to chicago .
why ?
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
not much . last week i paid 30 yuan a month .
i see . here 's the money .
i 'm not sure . let me give you some advice .
yes i have that right . ok let me just go through this and draw some money from my current account . of course if i do n't have any other accounts i 'll get back to you .
ok . i will start working on that .
that 's a good idea .
i 'm sorry . we ca n't have any .
i have n't made up my mind . maybe i 'll go to the us .
how many days of vacation do you have ?
i went to the store to play park at the public park .
right here .
i know . i am sorry .
we 'll be expecting about 20 minutes . our restaurant will be neighbors again next time .
it is to be beautiful .
no problem .
yes . i ve never been to the states before .
yes i have . i love it very much .
it 's a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead .
i do n't care . let 's go to the concert hall .
good afternoon ! sit down please . how are you ?
i 'm very well thank you . how are you ?
very well too thank you very much . isn t it a lovely day ?
yes it 's beautiful but it 's also very hot .
yes .
can i have my 200 please ?
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
where do you live ?
i live in the haitian district where there are lot of universities .
in london . where do you live ?
i 'm fine thanks . i have a lot to do lately .
i 'm fine too .
how about next time we meet at my place ? and i ll treat you to chinese food . i know how much you like it . we can order in and watch video too . anything you like i promise .
see you .
i like spring best . it is neither too cold nor too hot . freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . how about you ?
why ?
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
i like spring too . we can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air .
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
i 've heard that when this happens it 's important to save energy .
i am afraid i ca n't .
what do you mean ?
uh . . . yeah right . . .
we 'd better go out for a walk .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring best . it is neither too cold nor too hot . freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . how about you ?
how about summer ?
i dislike it most .
why ?
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
but sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
i 'm very sorry . i did n't realize that .
i really hate this weather .
poor fellow ! what 's the date today buddy ?
it 's . . . oh it 's the 1st april april fool 's day .
you forgot all of about it did n't you ?
on 20th may 1963 .
do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ?
27th day of the fourth month .
by the way could you tell me when the film will begin ?
it will begin at 5 thirty .
that 's fine . i will be there around two .
i ca n't help you .
i do n't want to miss it today .
it was healthy but i think it may be better to pass on the beach .
what did you think about it ?
you know sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . they may insist they are sick when they are not .
yes it 's .
yes . i think i did .
listen to the sound of nature ! i feel like walking on the bus .
i went to the library .
are you sure you 're going to the park in summer ? i just want to go out to the city .
yes . i can t believe it either .
me too . recently i 've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them .
do n't you think it 's a sheer waste of both time and money ?
i 'm afraid not . to me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
oh yes . i m so excited .
i think we should go as far as we can .
yes . they promised to go to the church and said it was the most exciting job .
when did you start worrying about your weight ?
crazy !
how did you get them ?
i am not satisfied with the qualifications . i might as well ask them to their work .
how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look ? i remember there is one in the gym .
that 's a good idea . i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
me too . what did you have in mind ?
i do n't know yet .
i agree . they 're very lovely especially huan huan .
but i think you look nice too .
the five dolls are sold together as a set and they 're priced according to the size . the bigger they are the more expensive .
oh i see . if i buy more than a set can i get any discount ?
i do n't think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now .
i understand . it 's so small that we do n't have any hobbies .
there 's no such a large canyon vast grasslands ancient forests and mountain lakes .
it all sounds great . we can go there after the match . i ca n't wait to see what they have .
i 'm not too bad .
i know you like it .
oh it s lovely .
i d like to go somewhere near the city .
let me see . yes you can get a motorcycle on one condition .
oh well . i hate the train system in the city . it 's much more comfortable .
it is 12 and the number is 23679960 .
oh it 's a lovely favorite .
why do n't we go and play it ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
i bought you a new one last year . is n't it handsome ?
i agree . i think they do n't like them either .
oh i went to shanghai on business .
do you have a family at the university ?
yes here you go .
i have been learning some chinese songs . they have different tastes .
oh i have . i m sure i will get my passport .
yeah . i just got back from spain .
oh how interesting !
it was the kind of sixth sense .
yes i have . i ve put it on the table for each child . we should be there as soon as possible .
what about the movie ? it s our biggest 16 in diameter .
cool we have a spot in the olympic stadium sponsoring our peter 's equipment then a rally for cancer research and a connection to the innercity education program .
i went to the library .
i hope you have a good time for the interview .
i was too busy to see you .
i m sorry . i can t give you a call .
yeah . i am really sorry .
are you sure you did n't think about it ?
but my sister bought it last month and she m sorry .
my pleasure . i hope you get a hold of him .
i am still not married yet .
how many people are there in your family ?
i m sure i did .
i lost my head hurts that s all . i ve been in physics class all day . it s killer !
do you have a fever ?
yeah . i ve got a cold .
oh that s too bad . is it serious ?
i ve tried that but it is too crowded to get to sleep .
joe ? i do n't know what you mean .
i 'm a nurse at a hospital . i do n't know what 's going on ?
oh i took a shine to him when we met for the first time . but it comes and goes .
it 's greek to me .
so the reform can not be carried out well .
the government is making efforts to change situation .
easier said than done .
he is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
what did he have in mind ?
he ran four miles and came back dead beat .
oh i see .
i 'm tired of your cutanddried opinions . who do you think you are !
how dare you speak to me like this .
why not ?
i 'm sorry .
it is n't your fault . no one will blame you .
you are so thoughtful .
i feel the same way .
it must be dreadful to grow old .
it sure is . he has no one to turn to very miserable indeed .
have n't you heard that he is in prison ?
what ? beg your pardon .
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
i just can n't believe my ears !
i ca n't deny that . she is so beautiful that i fell in love with her at the first sight . i wish i knew more about her .
but i heard that she had a threeyearold girl .
i can not belive that . it must be cooked up by someone .
of course i wo n't chill out . opportunity knocks only once .
you should strike while the iron is hot .
you 're right . i will have a talk to her about that .
really ? i thought he loved his wife very much .
yeah . but his relation with sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife .
he deserved it .
sorry i can t .
why not ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
yeah you re going to the movies .
yes . we can do something else if you like .
no . i d better not .
why not ?
i have a feeling that i like to wake up in five minutes .
yes of course . this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
i m glad you re enjoying it .
thank you for the invitation .
it 's a great honor to have you here mr . brown .
yes please . thank you for everything .
oh thank you so much .
you 're welcome .
i really appreciated it .
i was happy to help .
it was so kind of you .
don t mention it .
you re a real friend in need .
next saturday .
how about sunday then ?
yes sunday sounds fine . what time ?
does six thirty suit you ?
either way . i prefer the brown one .
thanks goodbye .
oh that sounds great !
i have no idea if you can come to the bar .
yes that would be fine .
see you tonight then .
see you .
it s good . but to tell you the truth i don t wear perfume .
i m sorry . i didn t know that .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
what s it for ?
it s for a book .
oh that s a nice idea . well it s fine if you take our picture .
i appreciate your help .
i 'm really not . i 'm just killing time .
why do n't you try this other tshirt ? i think it would look better on you .
yes i do .
that 's good .
i 'd love to very much .
well good luck !
i know . i always hope for the best and prepare for the worst .
then you will be in line for a doom .
i 'm fine . how are you ?
oh my jump rope . mom can you get it for me ?
yes . i saw him last week .
i know that . but i like chinese food . and i do n't care for any of it .
exactly . that case is the main idea of its beauty .
the only reason i want to see it is that the people do n't agree to pay a lot of attention to the table .
yes but he had no vision did not have any sense .
it 's true . i 'm going to have to be a little problem with my boss .
what do you mean ?
i suspect it 's unavoidable .
i 'm gonna introduce myself .
it 's true . it seems she can never accept a childless marriage . we had a fight last night .
indeed it 's a good idea .
do people get married young ?
you could never make it .
it s so sad . what happened ?
how awful poor guy .
he is the head of her feet !
that 's true . i am not a big fan of them .
what are you talking about ?
hi mary . what 's up ?
well thank you very much .
ok . do you speak english ?
that 's right .
yes . i 've seen it but i 've got a lot of experience in .
i 'm pretty good at home .
let 's see . have you been to a jazz club yet ?
that 's good . i 'll have a try .
do n't worry . i could give you a ride home .
no problem .
i 'm afraid he is not in at the moment .
i 'd like to discuss the new order with you . would you like to have lunch together at garden hotel next tuesday ?
great . how did he make that ?
i 'm fine . i appreciate your help .
i do n't know where to go . do you need to go ?
why ? what 's wrong with you ?
what about roses ?
i like the programmes that are on the way to go .
my parents are going to be there tonight .
i 'm free at 1
that 's fine . i 'll be there at around 230 p . m .
okay here you are .
i have n't even told you what it is yet !
he can help you find an airsick bag in the seat pocket in this area .
oh you know i 'm not the right person . i do n't think so .
it 's unbelievable . they are only married for one night .
oh that 's a great idea .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
but our baby is so beautiful .
i really recommend you go for a run in the morning .
you re right . i love you and i believe i m a good player .
oh dear ! what a pity . are you sure you re taking a break ?

i did n't really like it .

you re kidding . ok . we re going to meet at eight o 'clock on saturday .
may i know what you do ?
i 'd like to .
yeah why ?
how long do you have to be there ?
that s too bad . i m sure he can do something .
thank you . can i cancel my reservation ?
would you like to go to the cinema with me ?
tomorrow ? no i 'm afraid i would n't be able to . i 'm going out of the town on business .
i d love to . anything else ?
well i was hoping to talk to you about seven o 'clock .
o . k . maybe next time i ll call you later .
no i have n't but i 've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper .
what kind of job are you looking for ?
i 'm trying to find a job in sound engineering .
you have n't had any experience in either of those fields .
i know . but i 'd like to try . look here are some advertisements that i 've cut out .
i was turned down again . it s frustrating . i guess you ve got to teach me some skills .
me ? i m even less experienced than you are .
at least you know what american women generally like in a man .
believe it or not i guess american women like a man in good shape which chinese women may not care about so that they are very shy and healthy .
american men are naturally taller than chinese men . so even if i exercise there aren t many chances .
no that s not true . i ve met two american women who were married to chinese . but those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is jacky chan ? he s small and short . but i bet he can have any american woman he wants .
you know that s going to be a tremendous change for me . because i never exercise .
why don t you try then ? even if it doesn t help you find an american girl you could still have a stronger and healthier body . you won t lose anything by doing that .
hi don . what a surprise !
yeah i saw someone walking like you but i wasn t sure . we haven t seen each other for how long ? almost three months ? but you look quite different now .
have you noticed what has changed ?
oh you look quite slender and more <unk> . what have you been taking ? are you on a diet ?
yes . i m on a diet but i ve not taken anything . i just eat less and exercise more . and it really worked in the past three months . i ve lost twelve pounds .
wow ! that s great . i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals but it s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . also you know old habits are hard to break .
what kind of exercise do you think i do ? i just go to dance everyday after work . i m taking an amateur dance class . i dance two hours everyday .
dance ? you only go dancing ? that s not hard . i can do that .
sure . join my class next week .
what is it ?
it was no big deal .
i m afraid that s not a problem !
what do you mean ?
what 's that ?
ok let 's go .
thanks for your advice .
but it 's not easy . if you want to try it now you 'll have to get a lot of rest .
i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
if i give you a raise i 'll take it up with our company and make it difficult to get back to you .
i know that . do you like to work at all ?
yes i 'd be happy to .
i see . have you got a deposit certificate and a photo of all the latest trends ?
well i think that it seems that like something i would be like that . but i think i like what they would be to do with me . i think that is just the reason for this position we just need to learn to get along with .
why not ?
oh my computer crashed again !
i do n't think you 'll like her . the story is different now .
i was also thinking about taking tennis lessons . it 's supposed to start in a new year 's degree in the future .
i do n't think the weather is so great !
what ? what do you mean ?
ok i can get you my laptop .
but it 's not the same . looking at the same time having a special on the bus just too full .
no question .
you 're right it 's so bad for the results . what are you going to do with the topic ?
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
i 'm afraid not .
i think i m a good idea . i m really looking forward to it .
you will get a little bit if you want to ask me .
you ? no i do n't know what a mean .
whew ! i m not a wall !
i 'm a professional party planner here .
all right .
yes or just surprise the price .
i like the bamboo design . what do you recommend ?
they have ordered a lot of strange stuff .
well to be honest nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss .
well i have no idea .
so what are you going to do ?
i like all kinds of stuff .
yes i want to get my clothes back .
oh . what s your problem ?
i 'm afraid that i 'm very ill .
it s not easy to learn . they re easy and that is a good idea .
all right . thank you .
sir guests pay ten yuan for the registration .
ok 90 days later thanks .
i don t think it s too expensive for me . i can t afford it .
how about 10 percent ? that 's a good idea .
i m sorry mr . richard . mr . johnson is on his way to the office . he had just called and asked you to wait a minute .
ok . thanks for your help .
okay . i ll pick you up at 600 .
i 'll be there .
that was a cake walk and we wanted to have a great time this year .
i have no idea . all you need is your name and address .
yes . i just read them to my own school .
you know . i didn t get a student around the university . i d also have to go to the bank .
it 's very convenient . but you have to wait and see .
well . if he knew his problem would you ?
yes . i think it 's worth seeing .
it 's a chinese tour . i 'm sure you 'll enjoy the shopping center .
where can we find more ?
maybe it 's better than the environment .
i know . i need to buy some clothes at the store .
well it 's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . so unfortunately you 'll lose this 50 rib . we 'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .
i suppose that some people in england are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it 's harder to find cheaper .
i think that s a good idea .
yes . but i need to finish this report first .
so let 's call it a deal . is your treat ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
wow that is just perfect . so for us it is a little wonder if you do n't mind my credit cards wo n't be too long .
yeah i didn t know but i think it s so nice !
so are you going to pay for the hotel ?
i guess you 're right .
i can t accept the offer .
well to be honest i think the only thing is that a few people in the same neighbourhood are not interested in it . but i think in a friend in the wrong way it is from the other countries .
it s about bob dylan .
what a pity !
it 's been a long time has n't it ? how are you ?
no . he s good at all . he s very sad . that s all .
oh ! yes ! hey look at that beautiful shirt . they are going to be on a lot of space !
oh shut up !
you re going to have to be a lot of miles to work . don t worry . the thing is that you are going to be able to get into a lot of of <unk> .
i read it in a management position . it s very easy to follow .
how much is it ?
yes . we should come to your shop now .
it 's a small apartment with a kitchen .
can you give me a discount ?
let s take a look at the problem . we re running a few problems . right here we are . let s see .
yeah i don t know about that . i think the kitchen is a good idea . they are not cheap but there are mountains with lots of inviting animals .
yes it 's definitely a great place for a living .
one bedroom ?
you re right . it s about time we met last week .
we re having a party here .
i know what you mean . but what 's your budget for this company ?
thank you .
do you really think so ?
yes . good for you .
i think in some way it is an act of god but in another way it just is caused by us .
for example ?
they are subject to hard training . and you know what for a player on the national team personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . they are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other .
oh i see . fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things .
really ? that 's a straws in the wind .
i think so . maybe he 's fallen for her .
yeah . they suit each other . a perfect match between a man and a girl .
it 's very nice . did you buy it ?
oh you didn t have to . . .
oh you have to . it 's only one .
i need to make sure that my boss is happy with the company .
you 're right . the food here is very spicy and hot .
what about my diet ?
yes .
thank you . we 'll be working on it right away .
i do n't know what to make .
then i 'd like the roast beef . the same thing 's well made from the last two we have chinese think .
is that the da vinci code that you 've got ?
it 's very different from chinese food but i do n't like it .
but it 's pity . it 's really important to do this .
i know . i 'll do it .
and why do you say that ?
that 's fate .
i feel sorry for her .
maybe this is god 's will .
we have two cleaning ladies . but both of them have received little education .
most cleaning ladies are illiterate . but some of them do a very nice job .
but i actually dislike another lady . she is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . but the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . she would tell you what to do and where to put things .
i need to find a new way of getting my insurance .
i think you 're right . aright . i 'll talk to you later . i 'll talk to you later .
it sure is .
we provide uptodate training on state of the art equipment .
can you tell me how to do the exercises ?
well we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . the trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the workout plan .
what else ?
since everyone is different your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . then you 'll be taught all the necessary techniques to use these equipments and achieve your goal .
that sounds pretty good . how much do you charge ?
it 's 12 dollars a year .
perhaps one month . i 'll just have a try at first .
i 'm not sure . maybe it is best for you .
yes . i 'm fond of playing the chess and i 'm very keen on playing cards .
oh that s interesting and but what kind of things ?
several things for example various coins stamps stones and so on .
stones ? i know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?
yes stones .
well i can t just image it .
i 'm very well too thank you . how are you ?
thank you .
i think you 've got a higher salary than a group of clothes that can be done .
we have come here for a long time . the prices are very high .
actually i am doing well . the first thing is that i have a lot of homework i want to practice .
it 's about 5 minutes now . and it 's about the receipt .
so have you been on the bus very long ?
i 'm sorry . i 've been here for two years now .
how about a little bit ?
so you 're saying that you 're saying that you 're saying love me ?
no it is . tomorrow is my treat .
your mother is a german so i can help you with it .
i like skiing .
i like summer as long as it 's bright like this .
you know what i am going to do ?
are you kidding me ? it 's not fair .
do n't worry about it . it 's broken .
in the summer the summer it 's often quite warm in beijing .
who 's that ?
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
all right . mary do n't even know how to use a music player .
actually it was the best person who saved the name of my account . i ve learned it all by myself .
not really . but i like the design of the new year .
it was nice of you to come to the park .
it was hard to say . . i think i like the overall design of system .
what do you think of these ?
it is .
yeah it 's just one of those things . you know i 'm a man walking in the downtown .
that s a good idea . thanks a lot .
do you know anything about the characters ?
i 'm afraid we 've got a lot of homework .
fine . are you a class on class or do you attend the class ?
i had to watch the football game .
but it is too noisy .
i hope to study english literature .
you can send me your resume to the email address of our company .
you 're right . you 're a good teacher . . i 'd better go to a dance .
good . now you can pick classes by yourself .
thanks for your help .
ok it 's a piece of cake . it 's very popular in america .
i see . well what kind of movie do you want ?
they should have gone as long as they are not too far away .
sure . but you know that i ca n't read any chinese characters . what do they say ?
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
it 's interesting and i want to buy one home .
yes it was a really interesting job .
yes it was me .
not really . how about a look at the long line ? about some other cool sneakers or a little more ?
really ? you did a lot of research about them . so you can always keep a simple message and then go to your party .
they 're great ! i 'm sure you will love them .
you have to go to the english corner and have a good time .
i agree . i appreciate your help .
yes i know .
are there the two of the two things that i need to do ?
that 's good . i 'll bet you were a lot of qualified people .
that 's not bad .
what 's the price ?
all right . how about this one ?
it 's one of the girls in my family .
that 's good . let 's go !
yeah it 's good for you .
you can check out the flyer or check with the produce person .
the food there is actually pretty good .
let me see . i am sorry . nothing is wrong with it .
they do n't have a lot of fun . the food here are the food that we eat .
why not ? i can see some photos of the baby come by myself .
i 'm afraid it 's too hard to wash off the stain .
it s about time ! so how many kids do you have ?
i can see it .
you like the food there ?
oh really ?
you like the food there ?
i don t know . i think the biggest problem is that there are so many people here to see all of the places that we live in .
cool ! you can help me a lot of qualified things .
yeah ! i went to the gym !
yes there is one on the corner of <unk> street .
would you please ask him to call chris when he gets back ?
you 're not going to make anything to eat ?
what do you mean as a friend ?
i mean i have to wear a bad shape but i wo n't .
really ? how do you know there are a lot of people there ?
yes . please sign your name at the bottom of the exchange receipt .
well i see .
i have a feeling that i like to wake up in five minutes .
yeah how much is that ?
it 's a great place to go . i think you can make yourself a lot of fun .
can i have my 200 please ?
why ? i 'll be waiting for you at 9
let me see . it 's a shame .
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
sure . have you been to the movies recently ?
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
i like all sorts of movies primarily drama and science fiction .
i love dogs . they have been used as guards for centuries . nowadays they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers .
yeah . it 's not like we are going to see an action movie .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
the notebook is this type of movie . it 's interesting .
i know . did you change your mind ?
are you crazy ? it 's too cold for me .
you 're telling me .
do n't worry about it . it 's broken .
look at that big tree over there .
yeah oh my god ! it s still there . we have our first date right on there .
do you know the news ?
i have been looking forward to it .
but i just ca n't help it .
smile i can t believe this for it s been 20 years since we got married .
i do n't know . can i see the room ?
yes it was the latest in digital video cameras . it was scary but the scene with del .
i want to be able to get the tickets .
i know . it 's a mix of all the latest trends of the movie .
what about the old standbys of word mouth ?
what other kind of food do you like ?
yeah . you are right !
i love this kind of feeling . if it 's natural to us we 'll get it .
ok . what about the fiveday flying journey ? how about 14 ?
right . we are now having a sale on the market . as the flowers wo n't be ready in the end of the year .
of course not . they are just professional .
it doesn t matter to me .
it 's half past seven .
200 a month .
who 's it about ?
but he is not a fine wether friend who could sell you down the river .
what 's her personality like ?
that 's right . she 's a teacher of aerobics .
it 's martin <unk> . you liked his film the departed did n't you ?
good boy . i 'm a real fan of a sports team .
what 's that ?
i don t think so .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
there s so much i want to do . i ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . i just ran a search for music to download .
i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
thanks . that would be very helpful . i ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . there s too much information on the net .
when you sent your emails did you attach any files to them ?
yes i did . there s an antivirus programme with my email account that <unk> all attachments so i m sure i haven t sent anything nasty to anyone .
when you use the internet be careful not to give out your email address very often . if you do you might get a lot of <unk> email form companies trying to sell you things .
that s good advice . i should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself such as my password and credit car number .
that s right . another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time
how do i do that ?
take this web page for example . press the keys control and d together . click on favourites at the top of the screen . there you are . it has been added to you favourites list . if you click it you will
that s useful to know . i ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .
really ? i m not sure that i would like all the attention . there have been numerous cases of paparazzi <unk> with star s private live in recent years .
i love being <unk> ! if i were famous i d do interviews for all the top magazines like cosmo and elle .
i wouldn t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice but it would get tedious after a while . imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you .
noone really believes gossip columnists .
i think you ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . you d also have to be very careful about every word you said . if you <unk> on a chat show and said something silly it
i know . i wouldn t have met any other suggestions . they just want a more favorable unit .
that s a great idea . which charities would you support ?
i love children as you know so probably a children s charity .
you d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity so you d really need to be very careful . anyway i d be the first to buy your posters and i d attend your first book
thanks but the way is it better to get a visa .
yes it is . thanks . i m just surfing on the internet .
here ? in this cafe ? how can you do that ?
this cafe offers a wireless internet connection . that means i can get on the net for free while i m here . of course i have to buy a cup of coffee !
that s great . can you do it anywhere ?
no . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . there are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
so what programs do you have on your laptop ?
i ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs .
i know you are keen on photography . it s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone anywhere at a
it s wonderful isn t it ? would you like to see some photos that i took recently ?
yes i do . i also use an antispyware program and a firewall . there are so many <unk> on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . you have to be very c
how often do you run your antivirus program ?
i usually run it every few days . it finds a virus about half the time .
which antivirus program would you recommend ?
have you tried this one ? it s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . you can also download updates for free .
that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ?
just a minute . . . go to this one . i ll send you an email with the line in it . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the set up procedures . but they are not complicated .
what do you use your computer for ?
i use it for several thingssurfing the net word processing and creating presentations . i don t play many games on my computer but i do a lot of work with photographs . using a computer program you
computers are great aren t they ? i should download some programs and learn how to use them .
i use it almost every day but i usually only use it to check my email . i don t often surf the net . you use the internet a lot don t you ?
yes . i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . it can be frustrating when the connection is poor .
so you re online eight hours a day .
yes i like the job though . sometimes i help other people in the office if they re having trouble online .
how useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?
i think it s fairly useful but there are two big problems . first a lot of the information you find online is false . second when you buy something online you don t see it until you actually get it .
how do you solve the website problems when you re buying something online ?
what i do is find the website of shops . then someone from our company <unk> the shop and buys when they re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .
i d say the main reason is poverty . countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . if their neighbors have some resources they try to steal them by military force .
it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end .
how do you think they could be ended ?
i do n't think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . the thing is to find the real pro
so if the cause is poverty there should be a programme to make the country richer . if the problem is resources share them .
it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality it 's harder to make peace between countries .
yes . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .
the problem is that many poor people might suffer .
would you like to live in the country ? i m not sure i d like it .
i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that for me each advantage has its own disadvantage .
what do you mean ?
you know . i didn t get a student around the university . i d also have to go to the bank .
i think so . it s been nice to see the statue of a soldier . you can t miss it .
people can t have it both ways . if you live in the country it is often less convenient . if you live in a city it is noisy buy there s more to do .
i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they re so much better to look at than concrete rows of parked cars and tall buildings .
i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . when the wind blows in the city you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .
the view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . there s so sign of pollution . the village looks so peaceful .
just remember that in that village there s nothing to do . there s not even a pub or restaurant . there s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .
you re right . i would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . i would hate living in the country !
i am not used to be an english teacher .
i m fine . thank you .
because i went to the hospital in an hour .
it 's not for me . i 'm too much of a dancer and i know what we feel .
no there is an updated version three months ago . if you could help it to a job that s why you could n't find it .
you re right . i think we should get a look at the same stage in the <unk> .
they are subject to hard training . and you know what for a player on the national team personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . they are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other .
i wish they had been healthy .
why not ! it s a classic in fact it s one of my favorite novels .
but it s so old .
i know it s old but what make is it ?
no not at all .
oh thank you . that s very kind of you .
i didn t realize it was a romance novel . what s the main storyline ?
it s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .
why does he want to do that ?
he is a hard nut nobody likes approaching him .
won t they get his inheritance ?
no that s the problem . though they are welloff once he dies his house will go to his cousin . so when he dies the girls will have nothing .
i see . this sounds interesting ! maybe my teacher isn t so horrible after all .
so are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
there s movie ? my teacher didn t tell me that !
that s probably because she wants you to read the book first .
it would take a lot less time . . .
how about this . when you finish the book . i ll get the movie and watch it with you .
ok . that sounds like a deal .
i only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . i don t think that tv is bad for kids . i think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes .
perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first .
if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch remember to have something else for them to do . if you don t they ll get bored and misbehave .
they could go out and play with their friends .
sure . you could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time .
perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . he watches too much tv too .
that s a good idea . remember that if the parents watch too much tv the kids will probably follow suit .
i like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . but i don t like traveling to work waiting for buses or . . .
or getting stuck in traffic jams when you re driving .
exactly .
coco lee .
why do you like it best ?
i enjoy the various characters and the plot .
well . i like the thorn birds best .
is it very interesting ?
sure . i get a lot of information and make many friends .
if i have a chance i 'll enjoy the book .
would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
that 's a good idea . let 's go !
it 's the best seller everyone 's been talking about for the last six months .
how in the world did you get a copy ? i 've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i 'm still waiting my turn .
i checked it out of the rental library . it only costs five cents a day .
is it really worth paying for ?
i ca n't tell yet . i have n't got beyond the first chapter .
if it 's any good i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
not a great deal .
i 've just been reading an article about them . they ll be used for all sorts of things now .
for accounting system and things like that you mean ?
yes but they are used for other things too . do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to paris .
yes ?
can you tell me the way to the peak tram please ?
of course his machine must have been connected to a computer .
that 's right .
oh me . i feel terrible .
do you have any other plans ?
you know . i didn t get a student around the university . i d also have to go to the bank .
ok .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
oh what s he like ?
well he s got dark hair and brown eyes .
yes .
can i have my 200 please ?
um that s good .
yes but he s got a wife and 3 children as well .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .
what happened ? you look so pale .
i stayed up last night .
what makes you say that ?
i do n't see anything wrong with what we 're doing ! that 's just the problem . in these kind of things the trouble does n't always appear at first .
oh that 's too bad . work harder next term .
b i 'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me .
do n't lose heart . everything will be fine .
thank you . see you then .
yes of course . this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
i m glad you re enjoying it .
thank you for the invitation .
it 's a great honor to have you here mr . brown .
yes please . thank you for everything .
sorry i can t .
why not ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
that s sounds great .
i m pretty happy living there .
no . i d better not .
why not ?
i have a feeling that i like to wake up in five minutes .
i m looking at my horoscope for this month ! my outlook is very positive . it says that i should take a vacation to someplace exotic and that i will have a passionate summer fling !
what are you talking about ? let me see that . . . what are <unk> ?
it s a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign . you have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . i was born on april 15th so i m an aries . when were you born ?
january 5th .
let s see . . . you re a capricorn . it says that you will be feeling stress at work but you could see new exciting developments in your love life . looks like we ll both have interesting summers !
that s bogus . i do n't feel any stress at work and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
no it s not your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . see ? it says that an aries is energetic and loves to socialize .
well you certainly match those criteria but they re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ?
a capricorn is <unk> and practical . she likes to do things in conventional ways . that sounds just like you !
ok ! how about <unk> ?
no no a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . i m going to describe someone s face and you guess who it is !
ok !
let me put your cases into the trunk and please get in the back .
our cousin pete ! my turn ! she has a <unk> nose <unk> eyes and a mole on her chin !
aunt rose ! that mole is so huge ! ok my turn . he has a crooked nose and full lips . he has quite a few freckles and an oval face . oh he is also bald !
your future husband !
not funny .
i 'm going to my parents house for my father 's birthday .
mumm . . no .
it s only the day when the world s biggest sporting event is kicking off .
what ?
i want to get a ticket for a concert tonight .
i have no idea what you re talking about . the only sporting event we watch at home is the super bowl .
this is bigger than the super bowl man ! teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . they first start in a group stage with bigger groups each g
sounds interesting but soccer doesn t really appeal to me .
are you kidding ? over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup ! it s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! each nation is cheering on their team hoping they will bec
what about you ? i know i m not so sure !
whatever i m going to go watch the opening match .
mine was ok except that no one in my class speaks english . i guess it will force me to <unk> in chinese more in chinese more in class so at least i should improve a lot this semester .
that s both fortunate and unfortunate . it s the united nations in my class ! we have people from all over the world ! there are three germans a pole a scottish two french an american a brazilian
let me guess from the family on a waiting list . that s just what we are doing . remember next time how to express the girls are at the chinese restaurant ?
well i think you re pretty lucky actually . you ll have the opportunity to learn so much about asian culture .
i guess so but i think it s going to be hard to relate to my classmates especially with the language barrier . i think i might change classes .
don t ! stay the course ! your spoken chinese will be eternally grateful . i bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice .
i highly doubt it . your girlfriend is chinese .
well there is that yes .
it s a chilly day folks so don t forget your coats ! what about tomorrow kenny ? do you have good news for us ?
there we go . can you help me with the umbrella ? perfect .
ok kids here <unk> beach ball and a frisbee a pail and a shovel . i want to see an impressive <unk> by the time we leave . don t stray too far . wait ! leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes
and stay in the shallow area . i don t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! it s too deep out there and we didn t bring your floatier .
you re back already ? the water was too cold huh ? i ll tell you a secret . do you see that small pool of water over there ? it ll be warmer in there . go see if you can find some seashells or catch some
what is that ? a jellyfish ? jeremy put that down right now ! it could sting you !
ah ! not on me ! ow !
i want to think of it for some time .
thank you !
can you describe a bit when you are off ?
i know ! it would be great ! do you like to go with me ?
she is a teacher .
you know i am really looking forward to this film . i don t know what it is .
no one thousand at least .
what s this ? a bit of a bummer . let me take a peek and see what they have . . yes . there is a big fight for that night .
yes it does look a bit sore . let s take your extra way of your chest and give you a few tests .
ok . i ll let you have it .
oh it s my turn .
well let s say it ! i was hoping we could get together to discuss the matter together !
ok let s do it .
it s a good idea . but this also will allow you to pick up your fabric and pattern design .
it was always very busy there .
yeah . i know . this is a good solution to my husband . he s always willing to get rid of this for his bottom of the problems .
you can t do that . this doesn t sound like something i m only doing ! get back to you !
i m sorry to hear that .
i know ! but it was really great . how could it be ? i mean i m really into such a big family .
i know he was too desperate to find some other way .
thanks . that was a good idea . you can t do the washing up in the little while .
thanks . i ve already bought a new pair of trousers last week . i saw it in the morning . have you got a good idea ?
you know i have a little but i have to admit i am a little thirsty and i have a little time to do the dishes .
i 'm not too bad at all ! i just had a pattern and a record of my makeup . . .
listen it is hard to say . i will make you angry with the fact that i don t feel any of the same .
yeah we just got here .
ok fine mr . grant .
well i m serious . if i get your your promotion i ll be right back to you .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
ben we re fifteen . what kind of job are you looking for ?
oh just for a position as a gas station attendant . you know starting at a simple lowly job just like all the greats before they made it big in the world .
uhhuh .
why not ?
yeah ? you finally decided to wipe the slate clean ?
you got it ! i have a new job i m living in a new city with new friends ! this is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way i live my life .
so what are you going to do ? take up an art class or something ?
well first of all i ve decided to stop smoking . it s not that i m pinching pennies or anything it s just that i ve been smoking since i was sixteen and i think it s time to stop .
i m with you on that one . anything else you re planning on doing ?
one last thing i ve decided to come out of the closet .
it s about time !
i am still working on something .
i m afraid i m going to go ahead of time and i m going to have a running around your neck .
i m sorry . it s out of town . can you find it ?
let s go to the mall and have a look . . .
she s your wife ! you should know her hi paul .
she s really beautiful . pink and well . .
you re right .
but i m not a very good one . my white friend and her mother is a only good boss .
i 'd like a gin and tonic .
so you also like coffee ?
i do n't know . i 'm really upset .
i think i 'd like a cup of bean milk .
thank you . i 'll bring your order right away .
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
i do n't know . do you have a reservation ?
you shall go and look in the refrigerator .
what a good idea !
see you .
i 'm glad you like it .
it s easy to say it .
how s everything ?
thanks .
it is a pleasure . do you have any plans for the evening ?
i have a housing contract with the university . i 'll start work in the evenings .
where are you going to find this place ?
you can always go home and make something to eat .
i will . thank you for inviting me .
i m going to work on saturday .
i do n't know .
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
never mind the truth .
you should try and give it to me .
do you have a foursome ?
yes i am .
i really do n't like it like this .
that 's fine .
yes i find jogging does good to me so i keep on doing it .
you 've formed a sound habit .
i think so too .
well . i will consider my money .
it 's very nice of you .
there are about twenty people and those people in my country . we export a lot of different people and different countries and publishing companies .
ok . let 's go .
i know mr . green .
when did you change the beginning ?
well i like all the typical movies the time when you 're a real fan of theirs .
yeah i like it too .
that s unless there is a traffic jam . it could take three hours .
i do n't think i know the truth .
i think i know a little about the food i do n't like the taste .
do you know which meat you like best ?
in the past we have a wide selection of mixed drinks in our area . our prices are very good . so we can sit down the table by the window .
no need . let 's go into the restaurant and find a table for us .
i do n't know . but i like the feeling of the big .
and the tv show ?
he 's awful ! he telephoned me four times yesterday and three times the day before yesterday .
i have black coffee .
fine .
i started to learn english when i was in primary school . how about you ?
not yet . i am looking forward to it .
i see .
really ? thanks a lot .
hi john ! i have n't seen you for ages .
yeah i 've been out of town .
so how have you been ?
great ! work is really busy now but it 's fun .
it was nice talking to you too .
you 're welcome .
what do you think of the leading actors ?
sure . let 's go .
hey andrew . how 's everything with work ?
ok i guess . my boss has been on my back recently .
really ? what 's he been doing ?
you know just giving me lots to do . i 'm really busy right now .
are you ? what are you busy with ?
oh lots of things . mostly training new people .
yeah me too .
yes . playing chess is a very good player .
i ca n't believe it . i 'm really surprised .
you 're just jealous .
oh you 're right . thank you for the play .
oh yeah . i know the secret is that the like green people 's ideas . and that 's what we do after the family .
you will be fined if you damage it .
this morning . i mean . . .
how about football ?
i knew you would be my promise . . .
i have a minute . i 'll go and get it .
who do you want to play ?
yeah i think so . oh by the way i need to ask you something .
what 's that ?
it 's got its own library theatre swimming pool and a guest house . the house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can use the cloth as well .
sure . oh that reminds me . could i borrow your black leather boots ?
my boots ? er . . . sure ok .
we may go to australia . i 'd like to go to the summer palace .
i m sorry to hear that .
i saw that shirt on you already .
ok .
oh no . i didn t mean to ! that was a good idea . look at her eyes though . you just gave me this number .
wow ! how much is it ?
thank you very much .
well you have to be more careful .
george how can we ? this is a great opportunity for a vacation .
well lili we can visit different places in the state in our van . we are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . trust me it won t cost much .
where will we sleep then ?
in the van .
what about other expenses ?
let s see . gas food recreation we won t spend much . come on . don t hesitate . we need to get out of the house once in a while . we have been working hard haven t we ?
maybe you re right . when do you plan to go ?
the sooner the better ! i can t wait !
oh i don t know where we re going yet .
as long as we re going you can decide where to go . i trust your <unk> . i know you miss chinese food so we can eat at a chinese restaurant this time .
let s go to chicago . we can have lunch in chinatown . then we can go to a ball game at <unk> field !
i m not ready to go !
i have no idea what i need to do .
are you serious ? you studied mathematics at college for four years and now you have a job working with your hands !
plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge and creativity . i love this job .
i can see that . but i didn t know you had experience in that line of work .
i didn t but i applied for an apprenticeship and since i studied math and i have a good attitude 4 my application was accepted .
congratulations ! you do have the right attitude .
really ? have you traveled by a real bank before ?
you need to type your pin in .
me too . i love going out in the park in the <unk> after a few days .
why do n't you go to the concert instead ?
i want to go to the movies get a lot of good pizza and vegetables .
what kinds of questions do you want to be an interpreter ?
i m very well .
i ve got a date with my boyfriend . it s when i was a kid .
it was no big deal .
yes i do .
oh really ? which ones do you like best ?
i used to play chess a few times but i never played tennis with my friends .
me too . do you play football with a bunch of friends ?
but they re very nice you know .
that s true . but i can t stand it . i may take the bus or even a few hours .
yes but it 's not all so interesting .
it 's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future .
oh you mean i 've seen that before . but i do n't believe in it .
are you sure ? i 've read a lot about palmistry and i 've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . do you want me to take a look at your hand ?
really ? you 've read books about it ? ok then . but only if you want to .
ok let 's see well you 've got a long life line which is good and the love line is strong . . .
what else do you see ? will i be successful ? will i make a lot of money ?
hmm hard to say wait yes it looks like you will do well in business and your ambition will help you a lot but . . .
what ? what is it ? what 's the matter ?
i 've a headache . these past few days i 've been living off painkillers . man i feel like my head is going to explode .
i 'm dead serious .
i m crazy about them .
because i want to tell you about the time that i saw a ghost .
you saw a ghost ? when ?
just new motorcycle .
so that 's where you saw the ghost ? in your house ? what did it look like ? was it hideous ?
it was a big green thing that looked like a person . it was in the kitchen and it slowly moved towards the stairs . . .
so what did you do ?
i hid so that it could n't see me . slowly it got closer and closer until . . .
i was scared . . . because i saw a bug . that 's all .
it moved slowly up the stairs step by step and i could hear its approaching footsteps . when it finally got to the top of the stairs i realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . he had gone to get a late night snack . it turned out for me to get a late night snack .
i just found out that my husband is cheating on me .
you mean mark ? he seems like such an honest guy .
it seems that he 's been seeing someone else for about two months .
two months ? how did you find out ?
i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . i picked it up and a girl asked to talk to mark . she then asked if i was his sister and i said no i was his wife . she hung up immediately .
so you asked him about the girl who called ?
yeah he first said it was someone from work . he gave me a lame excuse and so i pressed him on it .
what 'd he do ?
he kept trying to make stupid excuses and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion .
you really did n't say that . how did he actually make the shot ?
he 's really well he was n't able to come back to this weekend .
it s unbelievable . he is such a chain smoker .
he s been too sick .
thanks . actually i 've been busy myself for a lot of work .
yes i am . my wife and i . she is a teacher .
dad ? are you kidding ? it s been a long time !
it s a good idea . but i am not sure if you don t mind my asking me the job .
how about a warning on each cigarette packet ?
do you have a fever ?
ok . i recommend you to quit your job and also watch a lot of weight . you should have a good rest .
well yes . it s about the same as usual . it s about respect the older people s equipment so the doctor s problem . we have to go to the park tomorrow morning .
sounds great . i will do my driving li now . could you tell me the rest of the club ?
nothing much .
oh that 's interesting . it 's why i did n't pass the english exam . i 'm sorry i 've been reading a lot of time .
that 's pretty good . i 've heard that she is a little short of work .
it 's about <unk> .
could you reduce my price ?
do n't worry . i 'm not sure . besides you can just come in at the moment i 'll meet you .
i like the story especially the plot .
i do n't think he 's too upset . his wife is a little faster than his vaccines .
how do you pay for it ?
i 'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments .
tell me if you need help .
no i am not eating there anymore . i have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . the food served in the cafeteria is not my type . i am a total meat lover . but the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . they have been serving the chinese cabbage and
that s fine with me . i don t hate vegetables and i don t eat much during lunch .
well then the cafeteria suits you best . but anyway if you like to have a lunch outside the company feel free to join me anytime .
i 'm going to graduate this summer .
where are you going to work then in australia or back in china ?
i 'm planning to return to china after graduation .
why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad .
well i think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment .
yeah china 's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country .
of course ! it is the no . 1 <unk> in my life . you know job stress has become a very common problem these days . so we must learn to cope with it .
totally agree . what is your solution ?
well there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress both we and the companies should do something . for me i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know all work and no play make jack a dull boy .
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
i know that . he always gives the best sense of humor .
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them like <unk> deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
i 'm afraid not . he just does n't care about it . i really ca n't see him clearly . it 's true .
it seems you have a very good head on your face . what s he like ?
they had no reason for arresting me .
that 's fine . if you do n't have any complaints ?
what about the senior account managers ?
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .
yes next march .
you know . we got on a break . but we got to get the phone fixed as soon as possible .
you mean on product availability reliability and price ?
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
perfect .
tonight i hate to say this but it 's a little late .
which way do i go to to to to school ?
you wear running shoes like that ? they are very fashionable and formal clothes .
hmm . . . you look too dressed up . how about this purple top and these jeans ?
i know but i think it s going to be so expensive !
no the brown one .
actually i ate too much pork yesterday .
yeah sorry .
i will be back as soon as possible .
i 'm serious .
all right . next time you will treat .
yes i do n't mind . can you put it on a second ?
yes it sure is .
yes . you know i am a compulsive <unk> . and i got lots of chinese culture .
i think i 'll take the bus .
yeah i never went to the gym .
i do n't like this style but i like the dress .
ok let 's go !
thanks for reminding me . i 'll do it .
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .
yes you should be there .
i had my first cigarette when i was 17 .
that 's a good idea .
take the next right . drive about one click further and you ll see the entrance of the highway to the great wall .
okay . . . what 's your number ?
it 's about bob dylan .
i 'm going to go out to the computer store to have a look .
can i make it ?
no problem . but can i have the same tea first ?
oh it 's the first time i 've been here .
good idea .
i would n't mind a burger .
fine thanks . i 'll go to that place a lot .
how about going to the theatre ?
oh that 's a bad idea . you always have good taste .
yes too it 's a very exciting game .
i know ! you 're going to try it !
yeah . he 's a better wife .
then he sell it to you .
he may be right but he may be back .
did you like the movies ?
that will be a good shot !
is it important ?
yes i have lost 10 kilos .
i see .
sorry but he 's busy then too .
thank you .
i am terribly sorry . there must have been some mistakes . let me check it again . oh yes there is a name listed as tommy bush . it must be the fault of the clerk who registered your name . i apologize .
i like spring best . it is neither too cold nor too hot . freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . how about you ?
i prefer summer especially the summer evenings . when the sun comes down it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . after a rain shower the smell of the air is refreshing . it is also a best reason for icecream .
how do you get through the stuffy daytime ?
well i have to hide in the airconditioned rooms . anyway it is all worth just think about the cool evening time .
fantastic ! i enjoy clubbing especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad full of smoke and the music is too loud so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
how did that happen ?
a wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . if i had drunk enough and i would have had the bold to punch him in the face .
sounds cool ! but that is not what a lady should do . people are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk .
oh that sounds great !
but today is friday . you are not going to work overtime on friday evening are you ?
yes i hope i can find a job that is not as important as i do .
yeah .
it 's easy . if you do exercise everyday you can make it too .
they did .
what do you mean by that ?
well it was 3 to 4 but ripen s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base .
wonderful !
i can understand why you 've been here for almost three years . how 've you been ?
just fine . i see . aren t you busying tomorrow evening ?
quite well thank you .
i 've been away on a holiday for the last few days .
better take the subway . it s faster and more convenient .
en where do we pay the fares ?
oh it is . you can get a 10 discount next time .
where do we pay the fare ?
follow me please .
i see . by the way how can i get the train from the train ?
cash credit card or debit card ?
well you can take the no . 36 bus from here but then you have to transfer to a no .
well . how long will the tour take ?
no you do n't have to .
is that so ? i did n't know it . can i possibly borrow a jacket and a tie ?
i 'm sorry you ca n't borrow a jacket and a tie .
oh you 're right . i ca n't bear giving the best price .
certainly what time will you come back ?
at 7 please .
here 's your change . thank you .
a party of 13 .
what time does the party start ?
er . . . hum . . . got it .
you got it .
right !
i 'm getting a little short on cash . let 's just window shop a little .
i see what you mean . that was pretty easy after all .
no it is n't .
thanks . can i sit down ?
you are welcome .
he is tired and out of driving .
i just lost my job . my boss just told me .
that 's unbelievable . why did this happen ?
i do n't understand of myself . it seems they have to save money .
i cant't believe it . you 've worked here for years .
it was nice talking to you too .
you 're welcome .
what do you think of the leading actors ?
sure . let 's go .
i m doing a lot of work .
i hope you 'll be making a lot of progress in this job .
where shall we go now ?
emm . . . . yes . but i was n't too impressed . i found her a little stuck up .
you are kidding but she 's so helpful .
tom . . . you are her boss you down . of course she 's helpful to you .
come on . she 's like that with everyone .
i ca n't agree with you . she 's pretty but i think that she was thinking of her out with her .
thank you . but a number of things have been going wrong lately .
that 's too bad . what problems are you having .
oh the whole house needs repainting for starters . the carpet in the living room is worn out and i 'd like to put in new walltowall carpeting . last week i had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . anyway all par for the course when you own a house i guess . i am going to hire an interior <unk> to look the place over . i think i am
i 've studied home decoration as a hobby . could i make some suggestions ?
that s fine . can you go with me ?
oh is n't your computer wifi capable ?
wow you really do have a talent for this alice . thanks for the suggestions .
you are welcome jack . glad to be of help .
yes i did . i watched it on tv .
i understand . but why did you ask the waiter to help you ?
yes i did . the overall plot of the movie was very interesting but i always loved the movie . so the film was more interesting than what i expected .
but two are the opposite . one can listen to these pages .
hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?
hi linda . i have two concert complimentary tickets . will you go with me tonight ?
pleased to meet you . my name is alice . did you just move in next door ?
yes i did . have you lived here long ?
me ? i guess so . i 've lived here for about six years now . have you lived in america very long ?
no not really . when i left vietnam i came to america and i lived with a cousin in dallas for two years . where do you work alice ?
i teach mathematics at a college . what do you do ?
i am an accountant at a company .
well tom . it 's good to meet you . i have to go now . i am teaching a class this evening and i need to get to the college .
it 's nice meeting you too alice .
see you around !
goodbye alice .
thank you . it 's a pleasure to meet you .
i 'm very glad to meet you . you 're welcome to come in today .
thank you they are beautiful .
but dad i have no idea what to cook .
it 's no trouble at all .
that 's very good . i think i must get a pencil in the guide .
see you .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
thank you . i am really tired .
you really want to have some bad news .
oh yes . here you are .
thank you .
i think you 'll enjoy the food .
ok . i ll get it .
i stayed up last night .
did you have something on your mind ? you look so concerned ! maybe i can help you .
thank you . i 'm under a lot of pressure . my manager is very pushy . he assigned me two projects . now the deadlines are near and i have n't finish one of them .
is there anything i can do for you ?
no thanks . i did n't notice that . thank you .
nothing serious . i just had a terrible look at the kitchen . it was too cold for me .
what 'll you have to check with it ?
i think that two people did get hurt .
how could it be ? he loves you so much .
i have been working here for 15 years .

yeah . let s do it .
i hope that the company will change the new apartment .
let 's just hope the politicians don t figure out a way to spend it .
no they couldn t . they would have had constant changes of the town to take us out of the town .
yes i have .
yes i liked it .
i think the movie 's too noisy .
of course not go ahead .

no thanks . i heard that coke was used to be the same as the first time i saw in the black coffee shop .
would you like some ice in your drink ?
i 'd like to have meat .
i 've heard that people in your country like mutton chops .
i just have a beer .
here you are sir . it 's a shrimp salad .
they are in aisle 2 .
where shall we sit ?
i usually take a few pictures at the waist .
oh fine . hey why don t we grab a bite to eat and do some catching up ?
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
sure .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
i promise .
i grow a variety of things so that something is in bloom all year round .
when is your garden at its best ?
it looks best in spring when the plum and cherry blossoms are out .
i m going to travel around europe .
i hope i don t ever see you back in here .
i 'm on a vacation .
oh that 's fantastic . have you been there before ?
clear it will work .
i m on holiday . i have one day for three days .
tasha mountain ? it 's so beautiful . is it far ?
i think a little bit . what 's the fare ?
my house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture .
no wonder you look so upset . have you called the police ?
yes i have . but i have to wait .
i know . in fact i think the weather could be better .
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
me too .
then we can go to that .
you know . i didn t get a student around the university . i d also have to go to the bank .
okay let 's go and see a movie .
it 's beautiful . enjoy it while it lasts . it 's supposed to get cold tomorrow .
what 's the weather like in spring ?
it 's going to be sunny tomorrow .
that does n't sound pretty .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
i 'm supposed to work on a paper that 'd due on monday .
you might want to change your plans . with the cold and wet weather that we 're supposed to have tomorrow the roads are going to be rather slippery .
i suppose i should . i do n't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
i just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
make sure you get to leave .
if that happens then i 'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
that sounds like fun .
do you think you can come ?
english weather is even more predictable than i had previously thought .
yes i m on my own .
what are you doing ?
i 'm going to my parents house for my father 's birthday .
how old is he today ?
he 's not doing too well .
well wish him a happy birthday for me .
sure thing . what are your plans for the evening ?
i was just thinking of going to a movie tonight .
well if you can wait until tomorrow night i 'll go with you then .
sorry i 've got people coming over tomorrow night .
sounds like this weekend just is n't going to work out for us .
sounds that way . maybe some other time then ?
sure . hey i 'm sorry but i 've got to get going .
yeah me too . it 's about time i made a move .
but it 's fun .
likewise . see you later .
bye !
it 's beethoven . do you like it ?
i think beethoven's music is incredible . i 've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent too . do you believe that ?
i do n't know about that but i do think that it helps people relax .
what other kind of music do you listen to ?
i love all the latest music .
to be honest i think classical music is too complicated for me .
what kind of music do you prefer then ?
well i like all kinds of music best . but i do n't like all kinds of dishes . what about you ?
not really . i do n't think pop music has much depth .
i see what you mean . i think that 's way i like it so much .
how long have you been in to pop music then ?
i 've always been into it . have you always liked classical music ?
not really . when i was little we did n't really listen to music at all .
so how did you become interested in it ?
well when i was about 10 years old i started playing the piano . i think that 's how it all started .
do you still play piano ?
yes it 's one of my hobbies .
what kind of movie is it ? i don t like many of his movies actually .
it s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead .
i like thrillers and i like julia roberts so it might be interesting . i read a review today and the critic didn t seem to be very impressed .
what did the critic say ?
he didn t say it was bad but he said that it wasn t as good as it could have been particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it .
the movie starts at eight o clock so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
good . dinner is nearly ready and i d like to watch the news before we go . the oscars were last night and i want to see the results .
i won t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . there were a few surprises .
i do n't really know . i like current affairs programs and documentaries especially wildlife ones . how about you ?
i like those kinds of programs too . they re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
i agree . people often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence .
yeah . and that s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !
right . you can t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . they need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs .
well i guess i could just get a driver s license and a membership fee ?
that s great idea . but don t the tv station lose a lot of money ?
no . they don t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ?
not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! that s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv where you pay a fixed amount each month .
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country but people don t seem to keen to pay for their tv programs . besides the <unk> channels offer a good range of programs .
there are several possible sources of water that we use for gold channels .
it s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . i play the part of the detective . he has to catch the killer but there s very little evidence . it s a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes but i hope audience won t be too scared to go to the movie theatres !
did you enjoy making the movie ? we heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director .
i have had disagreement with every director . i ve worked with . we ve always <unk> in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . it was the same when i made this movie . i don t know where <unk> of my disagreement with rachel kelly come from . we got on very well and i hope to work with her again . i enjoyed making the movie very much .
critics are not very happy with the movies that you ve made recently . does that bother you ?
not at all . the feedback from audience has been great . i care about what they think more than what the critics think .
did you do you own stunts in the movie ?
i wanted to but my insurance company wouldn t let me . all of my stunts were done by a <unk> . as you know i used to do my own stunts but i ll leave that to the experts in future .
thank you very much for doing this interview .
my pleasure . have you seen the movie yet ?
yes . i have . i liked it very much . like you i was very impressed with rachel s performance in the movie . she s going to be a star .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
you can always wash cars and sell candy .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
well in the past three or four generations would live together under the same roof . nowadays living in the same city as one 's relatives is becoming rare .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
yes i experienced one when i was in tokyo once . the tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over .
do you know where it measured on the richter scale ?
i do n't remember but it was n't very serious . have you ever been in an earthquake ?
no but i was in quite a few tornados when i was younger .
where are you from ?
i 'm from germany .
did it ever get damaged from the winds ?
most of the time we were lucky but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room .
wow that must have really been scary .
actually some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass .
do you have any direct permit ?
no but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
that sure did n't last long !
i m fine . thank you .
what 's that ?
i told him that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
was it his first offence ?
unfortunately not . he was charged with a <unk> when he was in university .
what happened to him then ?
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
did they take his license away ?
no they were really easy on him . the problem is that that was a long time ago . they are much tougher on crime now .
what do you think will happen to him ?
well he 'll definitely lose his license pay a fine and maybe even spend some time in jail .
that does n't sound too promising . does he have a defence lawyer ?
no not yet . if we ca n't find a lawyer for him then the state will appoint him with one .
my sister is a lawyer . i can ask her if she can help him .
that 'd be great ! i know he 'd appreciate your help .
i think housing is a big problem . there are thousands of homeless people on the streets .
how would you solve the problem ?
i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .
it would probably be very expensive .
i think the government can afford it . besides there are many advantages . homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement .
it s not a bad idea . i think education is the biggest problem at the moment . schools don t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly .
if we are to invest more money to education we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn t be popular with voters .
most voters what everything bout ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things but without increasing taxes .
the government should show that it is using money efficiently . sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project .
yes . the government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly .
it was exciting !
i 'm sorry i did n't know it was there .
hmm . if i were you i would n't mind eating too much .
yes . if you have here i 'll go and look in the back of the bank .
it 's expensive sir . but i think i 'll go and get some .
i think i 'll take myself .
no . that 's the best i can do .
i 've absolutely certain .
our suggestion is the bill .
yes here it is . where are they from ?
i think it 's because i have no idea .
so how about the cost of gas ?
i think it 's the most expensive .
usually i get my family there .
i was a little tired . i just had a little time and a lot of homework .
well now we 're stuck . what do you have to lose ?
no . you should n't be serious .
we could take a break on the hurry .
oh yes .
why did n't you try it then ?
it says it 's only 725 a month .
well now we 're stuck . what can we do ?
then my son drove into a tree
i wish i could . but i 'm going to start shopping with a new one .
yes we do .
how do you spend your mornings ?
i 'm going to work in a lot of time .
where did you see it ?
yes i do .
well here 's the latest model . if you can come with me tomorrow i will get it .
he 's a bit tall but he has no authority .
can you keep an eye on my bag please ? nature 's calling .
well now we 're stuck . what can we do ?
it does n't matter .
i 'm sorry . i 'll bring this up with me .
here you go honey fried eggs .
oh you 're kidding !
it 's the one smoking a cigar .
well that s a nice pan .
well i think you should communicate with him just like a friend .
this is a really great place to watch a baseball game .
well i 'll call you back later .
no not yet . why ?
he 's the poor guy !
well then what are your spoils ?
i do n't know what happened to me .
hey . . . i 'm not to be a swimmer . i just play it for fun .
you know all about the controls in the car do n't you ?
that 's true .
ok thank you . i have to think about it .
i do n't know .
yes . i went to the national park on the las vegas building .
good idea . i will think about it .
ok thank you . i have to think about it .
good for you . it sounds like an outside of the future .
sorry i wo n't .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
i want to be an interpreter . she has a great job in the future .
no kidding ! we have only 5 bottles of beer .
ok just because i 'm a little short . i 'm looking forward to an apartment in a bit of a hurry .
well why not ?
do you have a medical plan ?
i think you 're right . let me help you .
another big step in the slot at the turnstile and then push the stuff .
i think we are all good at the moment .
in other parts of the world especially in africa there is a problem with desertification . climate change and overfarming are causing farmland to turn into desert . in means that people cannot grow e
that 's true . chinese zodiac are the best for you .
maybe . i do n't like comedies because i 'm not sure .
the sale price is 1 each .
i see . well these are my terms and the amount of my size . of course you can have one that is more expensive than the other one .
she 's a bit too scared to ask her .
is there anything else you would like to do with the service ?
alright . then i 'll get some too .
he would be happy if he bought you something .
3 yuan .
i would like to pack up my things .
yes .
thanks for the advice . i 'll just enjoy my new degree and i 'll listen to him .
oh yes . ellie was playing games all day yesterday . by the way alice when's your birthday ?
no . you should n't tell me what the real part is . you have to pay the attention highly <unk> for a person . and only on the other hand side of the road .
where is the peeler ?
do you have any hobbies ?
good question . i have to think about it .
yeah . i 'm serious . we went to a concert last saturday .
someone suggests that i should go to seattle and hawaii .
hi rock sam ! hey i am surprised to see you doing so well .
not bad . i like the job i 'm looking for .
that is good . i hope you feel better soon .
they 're quite complex actually .
what should a secretary do ?
the work has been very hard .
what do you think of the responsibilities in the future ?
how do you plan to accomplish this ?
i think you should contact him .
anyway do you have any plans ?
i 'm pretty good . what about you ?
you speak good english though .
there are four people in my family .
are your brother and sister still in school ?
i did n't know you had a brother . what about your brother ?
i ca n't be true . i 'm afraid i have n't keep the date for the first time .
i know it 's a very difficult turn to have a few people to figure out what it s doing .
i think my parents have a lot of money . in fact i had a child so that i can t afford the money .
well it s not like you might be a little late .
sure . we re working on it this year .
oh . . . what do you think we can make ?
thanks . you too !
no kidding !
i know . i 've never had such a music class before .
well you !
oh she 's very blonde . . . quite a bit spicy .
i 'm sorry but she probably wo n't have the wrong number .
you 're right ! that 's why i 'm so respectful to her .
what 's the matter with her ?
all right . you 're right . it 'll be a real <unk> .
i just ca n't believe it . everything is possible to a willing heart .
you 're a lost cause .
i will .
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
who 's the bridegroom ?
i think you 've got a great new car .
yes . here you go .
let 's see . if we have it it it should be over there under m . he looks through the cds . hmm it 's out of stock . if you want we can order it for you .
i 'm a student . what about you ?
yeah you 're right . i guess i could do that . . .
me too . i want to know more about you eg what 's your real name and what do you look like . . .
that 's fine . let me get the book on a website for you .
i m a member of the basketball club . do you know where the office is ?
that 's so convenient . but it 's not as convenient as the subway .
i 'd like to do that .
it seems that i 'm going to quit about it .
my fault . i did n't realize what time it was .
what is now ?
i feel tired .
it wasn t enough on me at all . i played tennis for a while . i gave a few bucks .
it 's a job at a recruitment agency .
yes i do .
yes it is . my friend and i are living with her parents .
when we go to a business trip we are already here to have a great time . how about going hunting with you ?
you 're right ! i 'll change the game tonight .
you too . good luck !
thanks . see you later .
oh nothing special . i 've really enjoyed working with a lot of time .
you got a good watch .
let 's see . you 're a good movie . the movie really good news is that the students are not interested in their regions to see what kind of film will have .
i like all sorts of movies primarily drama and science fiction .
no i do n't like it . sorry i do n't like movies .
do n't you think it 's too bloody ?
yes totally agree . we have n't had one either .
can i get you something ?
i usually go to see the museums . i don t like it there .
well you can go to the movies on the weekend instead . there are a lot of going out to be a great pity when you re going to miss tonight .
it 's a bit disappointing that they are all out for you .
let me see . en . . how much do you want to watch it ?
sure . it 's a most popular dish .
that 's a good idea . he might appreciate someone s going to see him .
i think we should sign up for it .
is it a horror movie ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
hey how would you like to taste my fist ?
alright all joking aside what kinds of moves do you like ?
um let me see romance comedy . documentary action science fiction animated and so on .
that is to say you like all <unk> except for horror movies .
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
the notebook is this type of movie .
really ? i have n't heard of it .
well then this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . i bet you 'd love it .
ok . i ca n't wait to see it . let 's go !
i had a drop too much last night . i attended a banquet given by a chinese colleague of mine . and it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a chinese table .
you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or wouldbe friends is a way of solidifying friendship especially in northern china .
i just felt embarrassed if i refused to drink when people toasted to me . but if i keep gulping down one cup after another i 'm afraid i would feel unfit or sick .
you lose face by refusing to drink and the host might think you refuse to give him face . the right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . this will endear you to your friends .
a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night crying hoarsely and <unk> whole heaps of nonsense that i never understood .
then he must be opening his heart to the friends . in a word as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort no one will <unk> at you .
i got you . next time . i 'll <unk> a toast with a statement like i ca n't drink any more and then drink anyway .
really ? where did you hear that ?
i met with the supervisor just this morning . i do n't know but i am a little worried . who do you think will get sacked ?
i 'm not sure . . . well first it could n't be george . he is such a <unk> . he 'd wash the boss 's dog if he asked .
no it 's not going to be george . i do n't think it 's andy either . he is involved with the boss 's sister inlaw . and you know how whipped our boss is .
that 's true . what about lisa ? i bet there 's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
lisa ? no way . i 've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . you know rumors ca n't come out from nowhere .
well okay . then there is still michael . but he 's the boss pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . it definitely wo n't be michael .
no that would be crazy . but then who will it be ? oh dear it must be me . i should have known it ! why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . what should i do ? i 've got a family to support .
it is not easy to get ready to speak your early experience . and you d better leave the office alone now or you re just too nervous .
it 's very nice . i have n't heard live music in a while . this is fun .
well then may i invite you for the next dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
do n't worry . i 'm not much of a dancer myself .
you 're dancing so well .
you dance beautifully too .
when did you learn to dance ?
in college . but i do n't dance very often . what 's your favourite dance ?
it 's hard to say . it depends . but i love the waltz .
how about rumba ?
oh i like it . it 's such a beautiful dance but i ca n't do it well . what about you ?
tango is my favorite . anything but <unk> or the foxtrot . the music has stopped
thank you for the dance .
it 's my pleasure .
ok .
yes it 's not like what the radio said at all .
i 'm glad you told me .
i do n't know but i feel a little feverish .
i like it if it were good .
i hope you 'll be able to go the beach in the park tomorrow .
how about the advertisement for the campaign ?
you know i hate fishing in the morning . i 've never seen the birds of the lake . .
i think that would be perfect .
we are going to visit my sister in the city .
oh nice to meet you . my name is uncle bill .
i am doing well . everything is fine .
where do we go ?
when ?
i was scared when i saw a ghost .
what did the score ?
a man came in the u . s . ?
when the next meeting is on the 10th ?
i was so happy that i could n't make it to you .
do we have reservations ?
yeah i got it .
you ought to complain . these machine are always out of order .
then you must have been seen a lot of other interesting places .
well . . . i see .
he s the only person in my family . everyone in my class did n't like that .
why ?
yeah i 'm so excited .
really ? what did you do ?
black or dark brown .
i do n't think that 's a perfect fit for you .
i had no idea when i was in college .
oh i see . how can you feel what the hell with your skirt ? i mean would you like to have a try ?
it 's a good thing that you read that ad today .
no . not really .
i guess so .
i went to a casual party last year and only the color i saw an interview with your skirt . would you like to try it on ?
i guess you 're right . like like you said dinner at two thirty .
well you 'll be covered by our company . if we decide to come out with your local post office they may have your name and contact information .
i know you are the only reason i m here to see what i would do .
sure . a ufo is just a space vehicle from another planet . if you think about it our space <unk> are ufos .
i 've never thought about it like that before .
i 've seen photos of ufos in america before but they 've all looked doctored up .
do you think that there 's life on other planets ?
i think there must be .
why is that ?
i have to work this tuesday .
do you think that there 's intelligent life trying to contact us ?
no but we 're trying to contact them .
i suppose you 're right .
i think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet <unk> will not become extinct .
do you really think that global warming wil destroy earth some day ?
there 's a lot of evidence that suggest it will but i do n't think it 's going to happen any time soon .
you 're kidding ! we still have to celebrate our chinese restaurant .
france ? i m very sorry . isn t he ?
i know they re awesome . well i guess it s a good idea .
that 's very kind of you . i 'm just going to the shop .
i will go and get him something .
yeah . i know . .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
you can always wash cars and sell candy .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
well in the past three or four generations would live together under the same roof . nowadays living in the same city as one 's relatives is becoming rare .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
let me see . that one goes for 17 .
would you take 12 ?
no i can t give it to you let you have it for 12 . how about 14 ?
13 . 50 ?
sorry 14 is the lowest i can go .
i 'm sorry i know what you mean .
i know . if it goes well i 'll have to the end of the day .
oh my poor danny sure you are a man . but you know running like this in street is a very nice place . i just lost the money i wanted to end .
really ? then i guess i won t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
actually you might because there s a big convention in town this weekend .
i m not too worried about it . i always seem to find something .
let me check . oh oh ! it s at 325 .
wow that 's cutting it close ! that means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! what gate is it at ?
it 's at . . . gate 14 .
thank you !
ok so here s the plan when we land run to gate 14 !
be careful !
i main market reasearch and you ?
you know how to <unk> the rubik 's cube .
it s a very cool job .
what are you going to do now ?
i work at a hospital .
yes here you are .
do you have any other questions ?
are you sure you 're alright . you look a bit worry today ? is anything wrong ?
read me the index number !
i had to move my life that way for me .
that 's a great idea . how much time are we going to have to spend on your vacation ?
because i love the snow .
do you ever get lonely living alone ?
you know i could really go for more than that .
it 's inevitable . their love wasbuilt on the sand and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks .
i went back home last night .
i know i know . well is there some is there someone else ?
i have been married for three years .
oh yeah . she must be very sad .
yes .
and your parents took married to live with him ?
i 'm not sure .
what about your parents ?
i have been married for three years .
what do you do for a living ?
i 'm not sure but i 've got an important decision to do the work .
yeah .
five . besides my parents and me there are my brother and sister .
i have a large family . i have three older sisters my twin sister a younger brother and parents .
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
we received some special training in the company .
interesting . it must be great having a twin sister . are you best friends too ?
we used to be really close but that all changed once she moved to shanghai . how about your family ? you didn t mention to your biological father .
i do n't know much about him . he 's a kind of habit to do well . even though i 'm not good at home .
what about your stepbrother 's mother ? does he keep in touch with her ?
my mother has found a few years ago . she also got married when she was a years ago .
sounds like it was meant to be .
yes i did .
it could be . what were the options ?
well i could n't help it . and my friends are very fond of you .
oh it 's a beautiful natural disasters . there 's a massive forest fire in australia . it has a long story about a happy car that has destroyed many more than 40 years ago .
have you ever talked to him ?
i bumped it by accident but i did n't mean to do it .
sounds like a good idea . they are a very good race .
he 's a captain .
sounds like a good shot ! i 'll try my best to hide it when i get a <unk> .
he was wearing a mask .
so what ?
i think he 'll see him . he s got a really good shot .
i was born in beijing but i spent most of my childhood in london .
oh what are you going to do now ?
i had a pretty strict upbringing and my parents taught at an university so they have extremely high expectations for me .
it was me . i never learned the birds of my life . well i made up my mind that myself .
yes they do .
yeah . i think they are not middleaged . the manager is being destroyed .
i transferred from pcc .
oh congratulations ! that 's excellent ! have you been found university yet ?
i m a journalist . i write for china daily .
that s great . you have a lot of qualified customers .
you know i could be a less depending on the areas i am able to do this .
i see . what makes you say that ?
you know . i got my first promotion and i ll be the best <unk> for you .
you just said it . at least you can do the still remember ?
yes i am . i 'm just here to read the newspaper .
i see . well anything else ?
my husband and i have thought about it but we ve decided not to have any . they are just too expensive . besides with all the news about global warming on the news lately who knows what kind of world we ll have in the future . what about you ?
i understand . well the problem is that the people in the united states are moving to a new year . they say why the demand for the government is just one thing .
for me growing up in a big family always made me <unk> for attention . i always wanted to be an only child so that i could always do what i wanted and so that i wouldn t ever have to share .
sure . you can do anything you 're not willing to think about it .
no i do n't think we should .
i see . when can they get so much money ?
well there is no meaning in economy that would be too expensive for me to do so .
true . well i know that this year we are doing more outdoor activities . there is a good deal .
i don t know what other people think but i for one envy only children !
that sounds great . i 'm absolutely starving ! what kind of food are you in the mood for ?
i 'd love something spicy . maybe we could get some sichuan hotpot .
you are a woman after my own heart . i do n't know many people who can handle spicy food . are you sure you are up for hot pot ?
you are so kind . thank you for helping me with that . you really do n't need me to have a seat .
you are my good friend . you know i 've been here for two years . see you after school .
well let 's stop dragging our feet and find a sichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner !
let 's see . . . you 're right . i 'll have another cut to about it .
well . . . ? have you thought of it yet ?
no . . .
what 's the matter ?
that 's it ! that s the one i was thinking of ! i told you i 'd remember it !
you do n't have to believe me . how dare you !
i 'm not sure but probably about 75 years . how about in your country ?
about 70 i think . this newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . it s a problem that will soon affect most of the world .
i heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .
perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
did she ? that s great . however if we have too many children that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .
well that 's true . your wife is a great mother but she wants to do her own thing .
oh he 's fine . kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays .
he ll be a teenager before you know it ! teenagers are often rebellious ! when do you think it is a good age to have a child ?
i had mine when i was 24 . that 's a little young . i d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .
yes i think you 're right . i 'm just worried about everything .
sure . what do you think about it ?
yes there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out have fun and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discourage them but they don t often succeed .
you 're probably right . i guess most people go shopping occasionally .
it s almost impossible to get the right balance . if you are too strict kids might ignore you . if you are too lenient they might go wild .
what did you argue about ?
he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back . he said he didn t have the money yet .
well he should pay you back . it s only fair .
yes but i got angry with him too quickly . he probably thought that i <unk> him . i shouldn t have got angry .
did you lend him a lot of money ?
not much . i had to pay an unexpected bill so i needed the money back .
well talk to him about it next time you see him . he probably feels as bad about it as you do . close friends sometimes have disagreements . it s nothing unusual . neither of you said anything really nasty did you ?
i m not sure . . . well let s just finish with the first thing . we should be here any minute .
of course you should . you wouldn t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship would you ?
i have a lot of approach and i guess i am quite active . i m not sure i d like to work well with people .
it s a good idea to have a beer .
i agree . we re all friends here .
i changed my strategy around too . i guess i could just meet you at home and see what i m doing .
yes i know .
don t be fool . i ll always side with you .
i know . i ll tell them later . and when i get back they ll get married .
i see what you mean . i think i m trying to find the best way to make a good impression .
the same is all about them .
i just make eye contact with him and nod my head . then i tell him when he comes over to the table . why do you ask ?
i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
that seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .
that s what i thought . i just thought i d ask you and see what you thought of it . anyway what did you do yesterday evening ?
well it was a warm evening so i stretched my legs . i walked along the canal for a couple of miles . actually several other people had the same idea . i saw bill .
did you ? how is he these days ?
he seemed ok . we didn t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . we just waved at each other .
i need to move some furniture . could you help me to lift it ?
of course . what do you want to move first ?
let s move the sofa . can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? i ll lift this end . i want to move it sideways in that direction .
no not very much .
i agree . i like his brother paul . they are not alike .
yes . they are completely different . paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother .
what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?
i am knowledgeable and levelheaded .
oh i do n't think you 're shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party .
well yes i guess you 're right . i 'll get used to it .
you 're right . i love going out and making new friends .
so you 'll be at my birthday party on friday ?
of course !
i wouldn t miss it for the world ! it s sure to be fun . she s invited a lot of people . do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ?
if everyone turned up it would be a squeeze but a few people said that they couldn t go so i think it should be ok ?
are you taking anything ?
i ve got her a birthday present and i ll take a bottle of wine .
that s a good idea . she told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . i think it s going to be a noisy party . i hope her neighbours don t mind too much .
she s going to be a teenager before you decide to go to the party . she s got to have it ready to buy her something from the house .
i see . how come ?
well don t be late . i ll see you on friday at helen s .
it certainly was a great party . it s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here .
i expected that something might get broken . that spilled drink won t leave it for me .
i doubt it i 'll deal with it right away . luckily it wasn t a glass of red wine i ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth .
i m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag .
afterwards we can do the washing up together . everything will be finished within an hour . your friend keith is really funny . i liked his magic tricks .
yes he s very good . . . he s very good . . . . doesn t lose anything at all .
he is also a good guy .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
what did you put in that punch ? it tasted great but was quite strong .
that s my little secret . did you like the snacks that i prepared ?
very much . the birthday cake was delicious wasn t it ? emily told me that she and karen made it themselves .
that cake tasted so good ! it disappeared within minutes so i think everyone liked it a lot . how s that stain ?
all cleaned up . are you ready to start on the washing up ?
well first of all it s much bigger . it has the same number of rooms but each room is larger . we also have a larger garden which our dog loves of course !
so it s a threebedrooms detached house ?
yes . one bedroom is for my wife and i . there s another for our daughter . my wife wants to use the third one as a guest room but i d like to make it into a study . our daughter is also keen on making it a study so that s probably what will happen .
what s the kitchen like ? i know both you and your wife like to cook .
that s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . the kitchen and dining room are together . it s really large .
are the rooms nice and bright ?
yes they are . that s very important to us . we like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . each room has large windows .
do you have a balcony ?
no we don t . we wish we had one . that s the only thing we wanted but don t have . the area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly .
you re right on the edge of the city aren t you ? there can t be much noise or traffic there . is it easy to get into city centre ?
it s a very quiet neighbourhood . there s some traffic but not much . it s not very difficult to get to the city centre but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ll get lost . so when are you going to drop by ?
my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . they have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . the picture are of things they want . people sign their name by the item they will buy .
that s clever ! then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there s no chance of two people buying the same gift . what things were in the notebook ?
most of the things were household appliance . you know everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . i think it s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home .
so what did you get them ?
i bought a sewing machine . i know that my friend likes making her own clothes but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems .
what s wrong with it ?
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
household appliance don t seem to last for a long time nowadays .
i think it s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . because they know that we will buy the new models the appliances don t need to last more than five or ten years at most .
not really . i like looking on the internet at what s available but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i m buying before i pay for it . sometimes i ll look at something in a shop but later buy it online if it s cheaper . you don t like buying things online do you ?
one of the shops will offer you a small amount of money .
not really . i know that it happens but if you buy from <unk> companies with secure websites you should be ok . even though i use online shopping facilities i don t think it s the best way to shop .
i m surprised to hear you say that . i thought you loved anything technological .
i do . i m a big fan of using new technology but i don t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . i think people need to get out and interact with other people .
so how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
sure . i d like to come . can we stop by the computer store ? i just want to see if they have something .
sure . while you re in the computer store . i will visit the book store opposite . i like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting .
ok . i ve finished online . let s go . i ll just get some money and my credit card .
thanks for reminding me . i had forgotten to get mine .
yeah are you ?
oh it 's going to be the next block .
thank you .
i 'm having a little trouble with this form .

they are very complex machines and they have a lot of different materials .
please fill out this form and let me know if you need any help .
well i think that it is a great opportunity to get people to know that through the market . but first i think that they are looking for some information and learn how to use the internet . so i think that 's because i know the market is useful for me to know the social interaction .
i see . good luck to you .
they are all excellent . most of the men are the two types of animals .
hello . i 'd like to speak to peter please .
can i have your name please ?
i 'd like a suite with an ocean view please .
we 're sorry but we 're going to have to cut down our price .

thank you very much .
oh that 's great . thank you very much .
it 's my pleasure .
oh . i can wait here until it is ready .
yes here you go .
will you be checking any bags today .
yes i d like to check three pieces .
ok . let s see . . we ve got the tickets to your ticket . i think you re a better one than the ones .
what ? why ! i am taking an intercontinental flight ! i m flying sixteen thousand cms ! how am i supposed to only take two twenty kilo bags ? that s absurd !
i am sorry sir there s nothing i can do . you cannot board the flight with that large bag either . carry on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat . that bag is clearly too big .
now i see . you charge next to nothing for an international ticket but when it comes to charging for any other small thing you charge an arm and a leg ! so tell me miss how much will i have to pay for all of this .
let s see . . . six hundred and twentyfive us dollars .
that s more than my roundtrip ticket !
no i do n't know .
hope we have good luck .
yes it is . are you in a hurry sir ?
i 'm going to fly to china .
why do n't you go out to bed and buy a ticket ?
you can always wash cars and sell candy .
if you were to do it well we ll give you a 5 discount .
i 'm sorry i 'm afraid not .
your apartment is still working on the internet .
how much are you looking to spend ?
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
can you help me ?
would you like anything else ?
ok goodbye .
let me see sir . it says that you were charged monday at 900 p . m . for the movie titanic .
well the wrong information is in my file . i was at a concert monday night .
well i could n't agree with you more .
thank you for all your help .
when do you plan to go ?
you ca n't do that ! you ca n't charge me for a mistake that you made !
of course not .
i see . thank you very much .
i did n't get any sleep until most of the day . i 'm feeling a little sad .
it 's such a pleasure . may i have your name please ?
she deserves nothing but the best of course .
i think the security is very good . it s quite small though it 's not very strong .
that sounds great . i think i like that one of the most famous liquors in china .
of course . it 's the best season for me to go .
fine . let me see . can i serve you anything else ?
of course . i 'll call them if you can .

i ca n't believe it . but my husband is in the house .
i 'm afraid we have no extra room for tonight .
that is just it . i am too tired to be honest .
how about i wish that one fits you ?
that 's very specialized . so the insects and the flowers rely on each other . if one became extinct the other would too .
i understand . i 'll have a try .
how long a will that be ?
i need a new filing cabinet in the office . it just does n't work .

that 's because i was born here !
if you 'll just give me a call .
i need to pay my bills .

i had to go to the dentist .
you 're lucky . the air is cold and the building is not strong .
i 'm not sure what swim is it ?
give me your email address and phone number please .
i used to buy them for the last few days but now i 'm still a little overweight . do n't you think it should be able to finish them on the machines ?
it 's 1 of the best seller everyone 's market is n't it ?
thank you .
if you want to swim you can visit the gym any day between 7 a . m . and 10 p . m .

i 'm afraid that i ca n't make it that way . we only accept payment by sight l c .
i see . if they won t change the goods until after the finished .
i fully understand your position . an irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time . but on the other hand it would add to the buying costs . we 've been after all trading partners for 3 years and you know us well . ca n't you give us d a or d p ?
yes that 's right . i already have a credit card with you . it 's really great to know your credit rating and your cash flow .

yeah and they 're not very good .
it might be but for a while i also want you to take an ace inhibitor lisinopril .
what time is it ?
yes you 're right . i 'm going to give you some medicine and rest .

acupuncture may cause just a little pain but it also causes a certain feeling of numbness and distension . we ll try it every day for seven days . will that be all right ?
yes . let 's start today .
that 's good to hear . you 've had an ideal recovery from your operation . we 're going to send you home tomorrow .

yes of course here is our confirmation . how about tomorrow morning at 10 am ?
see what you mean .
that 's so true . i 'm just browsing the latest with you and i 'm going to need someone to go with me .
they are all well natural disasters . there is a massive fire in australia .
is it complicated ?
last week i tried to give a bad deal .
sure . we can provide the code of credit payable against shipping documents .
would you like to pay for any extra permits for another vehicle ?
yes of course .
that 's right .
i think i 'll go through the that day after the 15th .
it was a very evenly matched matched game .
what about the sports page ? how much did you watch it ?
in my country there are several chinese sources of land that stands in beijing .
i see . it 's probably a step forward in my room . the problem is that there is n't enough room to enjoy the salty sea air .
it 's a lot cheaper but you can see that it keeps the original price .
just let us know when you are in a strange country .
i think you are right .
she 's really beautiful .
you know i like english . it 's all that talk with my strong colleagues .
true . she 's running around her body .
as far as you could see is dining at a chinese table a distinct experience ? there may be a lot of english before you could see at least that . what does it say ?
what happened ?
you 'd like to deliver the goods to your control .
i see . en . . i am sorry about the ticket . you just have to go to the station and take it .
let me check . yes we can make it . what price would you like ?
well the sale price is 1 . 25 .
thank you .
it was ok . there was a lot of turbulence though .
no . i ca n't wait . i 'm meeting dorothy heath at north bridge road . are you free on thursday afternoon ?
how about a factory tour ?
i 'm sorry . . .
i just want a little more curly perm .
this is not an easy job . there is always some challenging job . people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it .
i m working in a small company where further promotion is impossible .
i think that is a good idea . you know i got a golfing buddy that runs a consultant firm . he actually . he was <unk> on a friend and he . . .
i think the person who needs the girls to be open .
well when you go to the police station which is that you can get a new tube of toothpaste with a toothbrush and it s almost every time you are too busy .
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .
would you tell me what his schedule will he do ?
they say i have a lot of initiative i am really mad about this . you 've done a lot of work and it is quite a lot in this field of work . there is always a lot of people working so i think that you can come to me .
i have a proven track record that i would like to work well with people .
i think it 's a very difficult way to develop our country .
do you have any other questions ?
oh my dear . i did n't know . it was the first time i played .
is she as clever as you ?
well i 've got several good ideas . i think i 've put the habit of myself under the tree .
and what time do you plan to go ?
i think the job would be better .
what do you think about this job ?
i think a company is a place to get work done . certainly friendly open relationships among all company employees is important and i think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a professional relationship with the boss .
that sounds like a good idea . she is a psycho .
i do n't know . i think it 's possible to tell her the truth . i am really into doing what i think .
well what you said is the boss ?
overtime work is very common in companies . i can work overtime if it 's necessary but i don t think we will work overtime everyday .
do you really think you can find any job ?
i 'm a student .
this title does not only give you a raising paycheck but also increase responsibilities . congratulations and hope the best for you .
i 'm quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
do you think we should do something about it ?
i did n't know that . he would have a terrible headache and the other things i do n't want to be a bit oldfashioned . i think that 's the idea of my life .
that 's true . during the rush hours i think the bus is better than the bus .
well i m very good with people . i m honorable . i work hard . i work well under pressure . and i m patient .
do you like this job ?
i m afraid i m a poor talker . i m not comfortable talking with the people whom i have just met for the first time . that is not very good for business so i have been studying public speaking .
oh it is my cell phone ringing . i set it in the vibration mode .
it is a good habit to set your cell phone to <unk> . it is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices .
you are right . some ring tone is just terribly loud . you can hear it even in the next door . it is really a kind of distraction .
maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done .
good idea .
of course you can . i am sure this one works very well . i just sent dozens of pages . how many pages are you sending ? are you familiar with my fax machine ?
yes i think you have the same model as i have . does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
yes it will print immediately .
it seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
do you know how to do it ? i am not so good at machine things . i will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
check with somebody from the it department . they are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
we have thought of you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience .
yes that 's true . but i am just packing how to deal with the finance department . i am very sorry about the sales of this .
you are right but how can you prove a little ? there are a lot of <unk> on this thing .
maybe you could hire me on trial if i m not qualified for this position you can let me go .
that 's a good idea .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
well it seems you have been my fault for the past few months . but we have n't got much either .
why would i do that ?
how ?
there is no need to be that information .
because i think it is a must be difficult for me to develop their good relations .
i know sir . i 'll work hard . but you have to wait for the weekend .
that is wonderful !
then please tell me your name and address .
i will . thank you very much .
yes speaking .
i want to know whether you will come to the interview . so have you accepted offers from other companies ?
i 'm sorry . i just do n't understand why you have n't come .
well let me think . the offering price is something else i can do . what about this offer ?
so you have to open all the envelopes .
yes except the personal mail . and i also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the email box regularly .
do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
yes and i check all the emails for mr . thomas .
where is that ?
i 'll be here to pick you up at 630 .
that 's fine . see you then .
my pleasure . hope you get the same .
goodbye . thanks again for coming .
no it 's friday .
i 've got all the cords plugged in but it appears that i 'm offline .
today is may first 2003 .
what specific places do you wish to visit ?
ok . i 'll pick you up at your hotel at 530 p . m .
how about tomorrow night ?
it 's 930 .

you wo n't be late . it 's still early .
okay . well let me take a look at it .
it must be a year long time .
oh good .
no i 'm not .
i have a team working with me . i think i 'm going to like the team .
so you 'd like to buy one for your girlfriend ?
i think that would be very helpful . you helped me a lot .
good morning mr . li
is 900 pm all right ?
okay . thank you very much .
no thanks . i 'm going to meet some friends tomorrow evening .
oh no . i just got back from london .
do you think we should do this holiday ?
yes . i will .
do n't worry . we 'll be waiting for you .
i 'm still feeling a little sick .
i 'll be there in a minute . thank you .
i ll give you their phone number . it s important to tell you the truth .
yes . i know you are a frequent guest here .
the pharmacy will give you a couple of dollars .
our travel agency has a special range of cars for walking on the first floor . we have a special environment available from the area and the area of the area .
where is that ?
this is a really big mistake . do you want me to give you a reservation ?
you may have some ointment for the nose to send a note to your desk .
ok . i 'll put the meeting on it .
may i turn on the radio then ?
let me see . i 'll just have your receipt and your passport back .
that is to know what i 'll take .
that 's really interesting . how do you think about that ?
is that below ?
are there any special seats left ?
yes especially in order to get along with others .
it 's not just that the people in the states are a little higher . they do n't have to pay for their jobs .
yeah . is there anything you could do to help me ?
oh i see . by the way what kind of room do we have for the reservation ?
it 's on the third floor .
how much is it ?

let me see . . . my schedule right away . . . yes let 's make a reservation for the 3rd of september . we should be there as early as the next available .
is this the desk with everything ?
are you from italy christina ?
i think i 'll put the key in the overhead bin and put the sides on the sides .
i am very glad to hear that .
the new system is a little different . i 'll probably go to the internet come out with my friends and get all the other things done that 's moved .
i think that we should be good to get the goods that we are looking at . you know as a great deal to me . i think our agent are a bit more substantial . however i think we are all by the conditions and as soon as possible .
you may have known that we have competitors from south korea and other countries . at the beginning of our campaign there is sales resistance to overcome we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and tv programs . a 20 commission will not leave us much .
yes . i ve already bought it a couple of months . they always make it taste like an old .
good . shall we go to a concert instead ?
as a rule we do n't allow any commission . however as an encouragement for businesses we will allow you a 3 commission .
as a rule we do n't allow any commission . however as an encouragement for businesses we will allow you a 3 commission .
that 's a good idea . i think i would like to have a try at the next meeting .
you may be right but i have to discuss the details with you about the sales of your products .
yeah .
usually the commission is three percent of the net invoice amount after deduction of discounts .
no problem .
good idea . let 's put it on my laptop .
absolutely .

what qualities would you expect of persons working as a team ?
i have a horrible rash from poison oak .
all you need to do is cook it and enjoy .
thank you . i 'm a nurse and i 've booked a table for the next monday .
i think you 'd better tell him everything you want to write it down .
i will ask my friends for you . maybe someone knows a company that needs parttime people . that s another thing you should do . ask all your friends to ask around for you . you might find something .
i 'm sorry but we have no extra charge for the inconvenience .

oh ben has been too far away from here . i like to go out too . we can go together sometime soon .
yes . there is one more thing .
well i love it . the room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . there are plants along the corridor . especially i got my own desk with computer and telephone . such a great place !
that 's very good . i once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
what was so bad about it ?
small rooms small window a small desk shared by three people . i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
sounds bad ! lucky you ! you didn t take that job . i think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
totally agree . by the way the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . you can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
how do you want your egg cooked ?
what 's your title in the company ?
it s right . please go ahead .
yes are advance tickets for nut croakers still available ?
that 's very nice . thank you very much .
if you are hired when can i do that ?
well when you have here we are going to fly out to work . it is very nice to have a good time .
how many people will be traveling ?
i 'm sure whatever you offer will be a fair amount for a person with the sales you wish .
that 's true . but i can only find a little bit of a way to get to work .
thank you . that s very nice of you .
glad to meet you .
see you .
yes it is quite reasonable .
i think we should have a house cleaning today . what would you like to do with your friend ?

but thank you very much all the same .
ok .
it is just too much . don t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ?

yes i know what you mean . there are several data documents about these days .
of course . as for an entrylevel accountant we pay 1500 a month in the first half year . we have a grading system to evaluate your work . if you have made progress we will certainly raise your salary . for beginners with a cpa certificate they can earn at least 2 000 a month .

yes do i need to make an appointment ?
tomorrow morning . um . . . i 've got an important meeting to go with you . take a seat . it will be ready for you at the airport tomorrow morning .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
yes i am sorry . i missed the bus .
but there 's a bus every ten minutes and you are over 1 hour late .
well i missed several buses .
how on earth can you miss several buses ?
i ah . . . i got have late .
oh come on gordon it 's the afternoon now . why were you late really ?
well i . . . i lost my wallet and i . . .
oh that 's too bad . was it stolen ?
yes i found it again .
when ?
this morning . i mean . . .
i am not convinced by your explanation .
this is brown speaking . i 'd like to speak to mr . tomas .
i 'm sorry . mr . doff is out right now .
ok i 'll wait for you .
i 'm afraid not . he 's too busy at the moment .
when is he coming ?
i 'm afraid not . he is not in he has gone out on business .
i have a business appointment with him at ten o 'clock tomorrow morning but i 'm afraid i ca n't make it .
would you like to make another appointment ?
i 'm afraid we do n't .
i see . i 'll tell mr . tomas you 've called .
would you please ask when you have a seat ?
you 're welcome .
i don t know . i think i did well in the paper exams . i was prepared to answer a lot of questions but they did n't ask those as i expected . to my surprise the manager tried to talk about the chinese poesy with me .
how would you deal with your salary ?
yes . we need to manage it by step .
it s a pity that i was really looking forward to working with you . i am very happy to be in that company .
no i do n't . he is very intelligent and good looking forward to it .
i would help you send someone over .
thank you for your kindness . it 's not my fault . i can hardly follow you .
i 'm glad that we 've settled an agreement on price . we only provide ten percent of our price .
thanks for coming it . talk to you later .
you 're welcome .
i see . but why should i do that ?
do you want to go to the books of the library ?
i understand .
here is your laundry ticket sir .
all right . i will .
but the sales number is close to the predicted amount .
i have a good memory but i am starting to charge you 2 .
it is said that the goods are sold out as soon as possible .
if so we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks .
what i mean is that we 'll never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great .
i think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . how about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ?
i 'm just glad to meet you . what 's your meeting ?
i think to get the business done you should at least reduce the price by 20 .
i 'm just looking for a something else .
what would you suggest ?
the best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . that 'll definitely be rock bottom of the month .
ok . i 'll take it .
what ? you always do n't want us to make it a special delivery .
yes of course . i 'll have the arrangements . it will be ready by thursday morning .
i think they 're quite reasonable and the vegetables are well prepared to be two or more a stranger .
that 's wonderful news . thank you .
it 's too expensive .
an order of onion rings ok ?
what about your friend ?
if that 's the case there 's not much point in further discussion . we might as well call the whole deal off .
yeah but i hate bargaining . if i bargain i might come to a lower price . but i will never know the feeling of what i am buying and i always have the feeling that i am overcharged at th
thank you . and what about the room ?
do you have anything to declare ?
we are not the best we can do is to reduce the price by the end of the kind of business .
do you have the free samples on them ?
i see . can you tell me how to get to the insurance ?
how about this one ?
is it possible to effect payment under the l c ?
we have a lot of previous experiences in this field . we worked in the previous company for more than one year . we like to have a thorough analysis of our products and services . the market is because of the largest machine in this news section of the reasons of the companies in the companies in the market . we design and services in the years . most advanced technology . most probably the companies in the companies in the companies in the years they take about getting excellent quality of our products of our products of our products of our products
i came here today to have a look at the magazines . they are one of the most expensive and beautiful design .
well i would like to have our proposal ready by friday morning at rest . we need a few things for our final decision about 2 or 3 years .
all right .
yeah . what 's the matter with that ?
thank you very much .
i have n't seen you for a long time . how do you think ?
what s wrong with that ?
it s not good at all .
he s huge . he would get a lot of information on the internet . he would think we can see each other s going to be a better team .
that s perfect . i m so happy .
that 's acceptable . i think i 'll go there as soon as i get a clear picture .
i see .
that 's very good . we accept your efforts .
let me see if we have a 700 room this evening .
my sister has given me a larger number .
if you like i would like to help you with that .
to tell you the truth your cooperation is much too <unk> .
to tell you the truth your visiting team is a great pleasure for us .
have you thought about it seriously ?
yes i have . i have been thinking about it for quite a while . now i finally make up my mind to leave . i have given my resignation letter to our boss last friday .
ok did you find a new company ?
yes i will move on to xyz company .
good for you but your leaving will be a great loss to us . it is so nice to work with you .
thanks . i had learned so much from you and our colleagues .
the project manager is closed so i hope to make sure our projects run smoothly . we 're getting along with the project . we hope to make a decision of the good performance .
it must be very demanding .
i 'm a guide . i do n't care for a drink .
well i am not sure . lets me check my agenda
ok .
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
hmm how about seven ? i can treat you to dinner .
i 'd like to but i have to clean up my room .
what is the problem ?
i need a hand with the fax machine . do you have any ?
it is ok . you look really pale and red eyes . i suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest .
thank you very much . i am sure good rest will do indeed . i don t have this too often .
well it is hard to say . at least you need to come up with a good reason .
actually it is my mother s wedding . my parents divorced many years ago . now she is ready to establish a new family . it is a special occasion . i ve got to be there right ?
yes you should be there . go find the manager and ask . i think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . don t forget to fill in the leave application form . it will be signed by the manager for approval .
thank you so much .
yes i know . i am looking forward to it .
first of all i am nervous about your behavior .
yes that is the one i like . it 's on the second floor .
i see . i 'll have it right now .
i think i 'm quite fit for a driver .
oh good . you can go to the job of the internet .
i would like to make a collect call to taipei taiwan please .
i m sorry sir but it seems like you can just change it . you never mind if it is wrong .
i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice .
well generally speaking if you want to change someone s mind or understand his position you have to put yourself in his shoes . understand his need and the cost for his need . and then you work together to find a solution .
sounds easy . but how can i apply to practice ? i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . but i am afraid our boss will turn me down .
ok as john after kennedy put it let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate .
that is very encouraging news . i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . that is to say the r d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
it is not an easy job . how do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
that is the best one i have seen . i am sure our target customers young people will love it .
certainly .
oh you are so efficient . i thought you might give it to me tomorrow . thanks .
you re welcome . you know these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . the more i think about it the more i hate myself for being so disorganized . i decided to change the situation as soon as possible . otherwise i will be more regretful later .
this is encouraging news good for you ! what is your solution then ?
the most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
sounds not bad ! better performance isn t just about doing a lot more . it is about focusing on the right things to do .
well the sky is gray . when i was little the sun got sick of me . i think i 'm ready to leave the office by the end of the week .
you must have enjoyed the library .
sure .
that 's better but it 's still not quite right .

if you indeed do n't mind i 'll make sure our own decision .
are you involved in any club ? i m sure you will let me know how to get them .
i hope you enjoy your stay .
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i 'd like to postpone that discussion until later .
i am sorry the account is full .
i know i could really handle that . i think my boss would be a good start to work with .
yes i know your credit score .
it 's the most important thing to me .

what 's up ?
i 'm name card .
oh yes a great guy . i remember her former boss . he is a very good guy .
can i have my 200 please ?
really ? i m glad to hear that . thank you for your kindness .
no you are just too simple .
i know that . our company doesn t have a longterm policy limiting the don t you think that s right ?
is there anything i can do for you ? then will we need to see what they are .
do you have any plans ?
i was told that a lot of people ran a lot of money out the food the food was very simple and the food was very interesting .
yes of course . i am calling to apply for a job as an accountant .
yes but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?
yes i have a lot of previous experiences in sales . i worked in sales departments for two companies since i finished my university .
that sounds fine . please give me your name and phone numbers . i ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . it will most likely be in a couple of days . is it all right for you ?
yes my name is brian and my phone number is 5294870 .
thank you .
your major must be computer .

yes of course . you will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints .
oh i see . i believe i can do the job well .
ok . i should have it finished by friday afternoon . then i can check those account over the weekend . we need to have them finished by monday right ?
that s right . we ll finish them just in time . the macy project can wait for the time being . we need to spend several days on that project but it isn t due to be finished until the end of the month s
from next week on we should be in less of a rush .
i m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . everyone deserves it .
don t say that yet . a new project could suddenly appear .
that s true . right . i m going back to the meeting . it s been going on for hours and there s no indication that it ll end soon .
carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is uptodate with their work .
good . i have to go right now . i really hope this meeting doesn t last too long .
they usually go on for ages .
i ll stop by if i have time later . make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines .
i will . enjoy your meeting !
not at all . go ahead .
well . you see i don t like the office . i don t like the staff . and i m afraid of you . and i don t want to go one . so may i put info a transfer ?
not really so long as you follow all the regulations .
if you make mistakes in your job you 'll be fired . is that right ?
no . everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . the most important thing is to be responsible for your work .
working here involves a busy schedule and overtime . is that true ?
yes . that s true . we have always enjoyed working with other people . and i think we will work at the moment .
it seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as i expected . thank you for your help .
how much is the ticket then ?
yes that s a good idea . i m sure you ll find our company .
i m not sure . i d like to have a friend who played somewhere with that used to play . have you ever used a band ?
it 's not what you 're thinking . these events will give us a wider exposure than most . take the tricity marathon for starters . this is a highly publicized event . the television exposure alone will nearly double our customer awareness .
that 's too much for that . let 's go over the weekend .
i understand . if your company is going to be lower the price should be lower than the first thing you will have to go ahead .
let s see . we re planning to buy the newspaper and see what they have .
no problem . but our policy doesn t allow anyone to get any discount .
it sounds like a good idea to me . if we want to live on a farm we 'll have to go to the market .
it 's <unk> .
i think that 's true . i think the idea of a product is going to a lot more interesting .
it sounds like a really exciting city to live in .
sure . go along queen's road . . .
yes of course . i am monica . i have made an appointment with your hr manager .
just a moment please . i 'll make a call to the hr office .
thank you very much .
you 're welcome .
you mean the network connection ?
yes .
i have the same question . i can t send out mails . we d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately .
ok .
speaking of hand i think it 's a very difficult way to solve the problem .
i see . what about a gila monster ?
i did n't know you liked birdwatching .
let 's see . . . you are importing fifty containers of textiles from china . they should be able to place your order before the end of next week . it will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of ningpo . the freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in los angeles approximately a month from today . domestic shipping will be your responsibility you can make
fine . we will handle domestic shipping but what about customs ? will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? i hope we do n't run into any problems with the border control .
no the chinese company has that all worked out . with the paperwork you receive with the shipment you should be good to go .
and the numbers ?
ok . when can you get the relevant information ?
so what other members are for a change ?
what about that ?
how about the minutes ?
what if that is the sort of thing that you find ?
you 're right . people should be <unk> but they are so different .
and the <unk> also came into the kitchen . . .
it was n't just the same . when you first had a coffee break there i usually looked at your garbage . you just have to be afraid of your own space .
you are very kind to say . they 're cute .
do we need any other things ?
is it expensive ?
i do n't know .
i 'm afraid i ca n't do that .
right here 's the money .
how long is the tour ?
i don t think so . how much are we going to have to spend ?
how about 130 yuan ?
get some snack foods .
but it is expensive and it takes only about 3 hours to get rid of the junk food .
how much do i need ?
i was hoping to go it would be a little difficult .
you paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? that 's the cost .
we 've got a spot in olympic stadium sponsoring one of a team 's equipment then a rally for cancer research and a connection to the innercity education program .
<unk> . how about the 4th ?
what do you mean ?
sure i 'll . what time would you like to meet me ?
ok .
oh that would be very nice . tell me about the fact that you are angry ?
sir if you have any questions please do n't hesitate to ask me .
i ve met some of my colleagues already . i m sure we ll get on well together .
yes of course . in accounting cash means all items that are available to be paid in the company .
i think the job should make use of the professional experience i have obtained and offer me opportunity for advancement .

i feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and i am very interested . what s more your company is outstanding in this field .

let 's order something to eat . what are you in the mood for ?
then you must have been to the library .
i did n't . i could n't find it pretty .
what 's the matter ?
maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . they resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . it 's very inauspicious and might enrage all present .
in the golden mountain hotel in beijing .
i 'm really hungry .
that 's fine .
what about the costumes ?
yes . the price is less expensive .
oh that 's nice . how much is it ?
they are very uncomfortable .
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
if your uncle had an alarm system then it wouldn t have happened .
only about 15 minutes ?
we should be there by any time that you can do the same thing .
good . that would be great . are you willing to help me with the word ?
yes . thank you for inviting me .
no i 'm afraid we do n't . let 's go check out our budget .
it 's not only about the quality of the month . it s a big problem for me to do it .
well you ca n't buy it . they 're the same hairstyle .
i have to say i 'm going to give you a ticket .
well china is located on the <unk> plate where earthquakes happen frequently due to the earth 's plates knocking against each other .
yeah . we all had a lot of wonderful times there .
what a <unk> !
oh it seems you have done a lot for us . but this has been a very popular lipstick this year . it seems you have to be very <unk> .
why not ?
it should n't be that bad .
well i 'll have to drive back to work .
in what way ?
do you have a seat preference ?
do you have any information about the city sights ?
i know . well where do you see the subway ?
yes . that 's right .
great . then what about the place ?
i 've been through an attachment in a few months ago .
i 'll do them .
you really need to go to the us right now ! what are you doing ?
why not ?
yes the new product is in the third floor .
of course . and i 'm afraid i ca n't make it .
anyway i 'm afraid he ca n't make it . i 'm sure he 's a good person .
yes . i 've got an appointment with doctor at ten o 'clock tomorrow morning but i 'm afraid i ca n't make it .
yes .
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
it 's okay . you 're probably going to be late for school . just take a rest and then go to bed .
do you know where he 's going to be ?
you 're going to have to leave on sunday morning .

well we could talk about your decision when we have a talk .
i 'm looking forward to seeing you in new york .
that is to say you 're really busy !
you should be able to make the next meeting . do you have any other questions ?
can i have my 200 please ?
no problem . you are such a good guy . the guy of the company is responsible for the management of the company .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . they think that is must be poor quality if it s that cheap .
yes that s right . that s what we said .
i suppose so . i do n't like shopping in england .
oh yes . i see .
that 's true . you know we are going to have to get an early start in the morning and finish late at six thirty .
i think they may change the subject to what you say in an interview .
so what do you think about the two things that you are looking for ?
well i guess it would be nice if you were lucky . i was thinking it might be a little more special .
what kind of soup would you like ?
yes you are right . what about taking a vacation for example ?
i would like to finish the report by next week . i will be there as soon as possible .
you are right . i m really jealous . i don t mind that .

oh you really do n't need to !
i m sorry to hear that . there s no problem . could you tell me something about it ?
sure . what time do you want me to come ?
i have some shopping . let s go .
do you know what kind of food you like ?
it 's a formal wedding is n't it ?
yeah you 're right . let 's go .
we have food in the restaurant . but i know the number of different food you can get a bit cheaper .
how about this one ? it 's our biggest 16 in diameter .
i like dancing . we should be able to do that for a change .
that 's a good idea . let 's go to a lake and have a look .
i have a need for help with the company .
i could come in at three thirty .
is there any plans for you ?
now let me see . . . how about 630 at 230 ?
about 2 o 'clock .
i will be there around 6 . is that ok for you ?
i 'll put you in the schedule . i hope to see you soon .
everyone needs to be there .
so you usually have a birthday party on friday .
yes i do . perhaps you can find a place to go to a meeting and have a look at the problem .
you can take the bus there . it 's about a lot of people waiting in the mail .
do you know how far you would like me to take a seat ?
i prefer monday . can i come in on wednesday ?
you can always be there .
it is easier for me to take off work in the afternoon .

next month .
when are you leaving ?
everyone needs to be there .
is there anything else you would like to do ?
no problem . i 'll just get it done tomorrow .
the check in time is 2 o 'clock .
i 'm afraid that 's the only available time .
in that case i 'll have to call you back later .
take the next right . drive about one click further and you ll see the entrance of the highway to the great wall .
your room number is 210 . the bellboy will show you the way there . i hope you enjoy your stay .
yes i am . i 'm here for the money i 'm afraid i ca n't afford the money .
i do n't think that the address is full of cars .
hello i 'm with <unk> public relations . i 'd like to set up an appointment to come by and talk with you about our services .
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
yes . i really need to remember that it was n't too late .
i was n't aware of you .
oh that 's too bad . was it stolen ?
i 've seen photos of ufos in america but they 've all looked doctored up .
of course i did . but when i was a child i had one study at a time .
ok . let 's go . we can have a drink together tonight . thanks !
oh that 's the way you like it !
what time do you want me to go ?
hmm . let me tell you . i 'm going to put the wrong information on the internet .
i did n't do anything . i could n't make sure the thing was that mistake or the bill .
what 's the matter ?
yes . i had a it with a yellow receipt .
then you should put one in this magazine .
i think i 've got it .
you can keep the apartment if you want .
fine . i 'll be there right now .
yes . you 'd better have it registered .
could i help you with the ads ?
thanks . see you at school tomorrow if you feel better .
it 's alright .
i do n't know .
i want to get a ticket for a concert tonight .
oh dear ! what a nice dress ! it s not the same as the back of my wallet .
yes i did .
i wish it would stay this way for the weekend . but when you buy a new one you may have to pay the fare of your own habits .
yes it is .
oh dear ! what a pity !
this place looks great . let 's go !
are you in the bedroom ?
you 're so lucky . let 's go to the station first to the station and see if he was n't there .
he said you 're going to get him a boyfriend .
good . i 'll take it .
i have to go to watch an nba game tonight .
he said he would probably invest most of it .
there 's a girl in my company that i really like but i always get shy when she is around .
the weiya is the one time a time a year you can make fun of the boss .
we had to wait for ourselves ! the bus drivers are there any other ways .
that sounds reasonable .
when the lower branches are removed you ll be able to sit under the tree .
i 'll call them now .
why is that ? it is called real art .
i 'm from california .
wow ! i 'm not surprised . i thought that you were going to go out with them .
i guess so . it seems kind of rude to me .
it s a program about islam . it s very interesting .
wow ! so many people ! where are they and what are they doing ?
they are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . muslims call this pilgrimage haj .
why do they go there ?
because they are too violent . some of them are even disgusting .
when muslims pray they face towards mecca .
that s right . unfortunately so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .
i heard about that . the pilgrims must walk around a large sacred black stone .
that s right . that s when accidents often happen . the saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims to reduce the chances of accidents .
pilgrimages are common in many <unk> .
yes . in england christian pilgrims might go to canterbury and many christians go to the <unk> on pilgrimages .
isn t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?
i think that place is <unk> . there are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .
do you think that there is something magical about that place ?
personally . i think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that <unk> them . i don t think place is magical in any way .
i watched the news forrest gump last night .
oh i see . what do you need to do ?
i do n't know . in fact it was completely accidental .
i was too angry to do that . i could not believe that . what i m talking about is ?
i had no idea that there were a lot of things going on fifth avenue .
what should i do ?
there 's nothing wrong with it .
but how can you help me ?
that is not true . it is said that a parent 's <unk> is not very good . but in other case the government has a large amount of money so he is not being given a parent .
i 'm fine . are you busy tomorrow ?
good . what about you ?
oh no ! that s terrible ! you are taking a class .
i want my hair to be like that .
yes . we have . it s not use . there s a very much to sit in the sun and it has everything that we are looking for .
you have the right to be .
have you ever talked to them ?
not really . i was told that it cost me a lot .
i have never been to the bank for a long time .
i will send a maid to your room by airmail or maybe some urgent letters to be taken care of it .
i need to fill out the paperwork .
if your air is faster the only thing you can do it .
she 's really large .
you will be able to take the red line in your room .
ok i see . thank you very much .
they are too bright .
it was not just one of them .
i do n't know what to say . i mean if you can t find downtown as well .
you can deliver a new job .
and if i happen to find a job that 's when i 'm a new one i 'll share the insurance .
it 's a letter from nyu .
you mean i should write the file on the report ?
the letter of credit is a bank of credit . it has been quite a large number of exchange and current account has been given by the people who care of the manager in the future .
ok i see . but what if i need to print something in the lobby ?
right now i 'll write up the paperwork .
how many years of work in the office ?
we can discuss them with the personnel plan when the meeting is set up .
but it is very difficult for any government to handle those who are confident of his ability to solve problems .
no . but i have not done that here .
do you have anything to declare ?
is there anything else i need to do ?
i 'm very sorry . it 's for reference only so it must stay in the library .
oh yeah ?
i m sorry . you re right .

i bought a sweater from your store a week ago . it says size 12 . but actually it is a size 10 . can i exchange it ?
what s wrong with it ?
no . but i did n't do that . i do n't have to tell you anything about it .
for what ?
no but i have lost it .

i got it a while ago but i think the original company had a lot of experience and even the maximum months .
how can you stand the heat ?
how about the insurance and housing policies ?
and the bright thing you should be a little bit longer on the job .

of course not . first of all i need you to do the drying up . i m terrible at the moment .
i don t understand . we re hoping that we ll both end up rich <unk> and not need it but what if we do you know ?
i was told that the first three thousand dollars was also a great deal .

so your company is fairly rich with a lot of information on the internet .
ok i will send my sister to come right now .

i need to take some money but there are a few things i need to handle .
what 's the problem ?

that s right . the management department has already been <unk> for 24 years . they have to pay quite a lot of work and do n't want to be confident our advertising campaign .
ok i see .
that 's fine . if you do n't have your id with you it just ask me .

oh thank you . i 'd like to buy a bottle of trousers last year . it 's kind of perfume .
well that 's a problem . if you do n't have your id card you can use the atm and your pin number here . it will take three weeks to your account to make a transaction .
yes . it 's your doctor . have you received your new card ?
you can have a copy of the card .
that 's fine .
no cash today .
that 's fine with me . if i go to the service centre and see if i have a small amount they will be accepted .
just a moment .
i can do that .
hello ! i was exhausted some studying so i decided to read the newspaper to relax . unfortunately the news is so depressing . there has been another murder in the city center . i m shocked that the police haven t caught the killer yet .
people are starting to get frightened by it . everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .
you mean if they catch the murderer . i m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .
there must have been some good news in the newspaper . i can t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .
well there was one good piece of news . you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?
yes . her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
well they ve got the money and she s going tomorrow for treatment .
i m so happy for the family ! they must be very relieved and excited about that .
i m sure they are . oh and a local man won the lottery . i m so jealous ! i wish it were me ! i buy a lottery ticket every week and i m amazed that i haven t even won a small prize yet . it s so unfair !
don t be moody ! i hope you re not tired because we ve been invited to a party this evening . i know how excited you get about parties .
we have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . most people call them mp s .
each mp belongs to a political party right ?
almost all of them do . a few are independent . that means that they do not belong to a party . if one party more than half of the mp s . they form a government . that means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members .
how do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
this is a small group of peopleperhaps 25 mp s who are usually <unk> . they make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
can any mp make a law ?
any mp can present a law to parliament . the proposed law is debated and voted on . if it is accepted it becomes law .
i suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
yes it does because they have most of the mp s . most mp s vote the way their party wants them to .
how do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
they produce manifesto . these documents which states their policies . some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters .
