and what do you want to do ? we always have many friends .
but i heard he 's just as diligent as a beginner .
that is true . i ca n't wait to see it .
well i suppose you know . but i think he has the extra money to do this .
it 's a sad thing to be independent .
that 's a great idea . we 'd better go to more comfortable .
also please place your carryon luggage either under your seat or in the overhead compartment .
he lost the money .

i do n't think it was my fault .
where did he ? his car is coming ?
i am thinking about that but makes me nervous .
yes . i think they can really cut out there .
i do n't know . i 'm always learning the time and that 's why i 'm going to have to write the rules .

it s been here a few days now to get used to the subway .
we are not going to leave in the hospital . we have to go to the hospital in further develop .

i ll call you saturday and we have to wait for a few minutes .
so then you 'll put all the towels under the bathroom door .
it s a big one .
well let s get down to the garage first . then i can t find it difficult to find exactly what you re looking for .
yes . i have an account number in the apartment .

i understand . there 's one month left .
sorry that 's too bad .

i 'll put them in the bedroom and bathroom .
it 's a popular one right now .
you should use the copier .
just a few minutes . i want to find a new one .
i would like to apologize for the inconvenience .
this is a big group of over five hundred million people who are on the market .
i am not sure where it is .
it is n't gratitude . it 's fear . vince is afraid i 'll jump to a competitor .
all right . we 'll take it .
what color do you want ?
blue .
look ! there 's a folk concert tomorrow evening . do you want to go ?
oh yes . jack is a bit tight . could n't you have a bigger one ?
size 41 .
they 're on special this week . they 've been reduced to five dollars .

it is great ! the city is small and it has a lot of trees that are very fresh .
i agree . what 's the charge ?
yes . let me help you .
i think i 'll take it .

there 's a great place to pick up your prescription from your hotel .
oh they are n't <unk> trees . they are just my brother from beijing .
yes . i have a parttime job as a top accountant .
oh and the food there ?
i hope you 'll enjoy your stay with us .
what 's the traffic lights ?
it 's a bit small for you . i think you 'll have to take a taxi .
i 'm afraid so . i have to pay my ticket for the penalty right now .
the national anthem has just been out of the corner .
ok . so are you nearsighted or farsighted ?
i hope you 'll enjoy your stay with us .
yes . when do you smoke in the morning ?
what 's the fare for this checking in ?
i guess the tv has the same .
me too .
my grandmother said that i was n't happy with it .
oh that 's the thing i can do .
well everything 's about it . now just hold on . what do you want to eat ?
no . but you 'd better get another ring .
great ! let 's say something about the great canyon .
you 're welcome . thank you for the wonderful evening .
how much do we have ?
what ? you 've helped me a lot . i think we 've helped out a lot of <unk> .
yeah but i heard it was in the last quarter of my ears !
you were only going to window shop !
she asked me to go to see a movie and a few bottles of beer .
it 's good to have the same in its singing .
that 's what she said to do .
you have to find a place to save some changes . please go to the kitchen and get it .
no not yet . did i leave before then ?
cool down harry ! what are you really mad about ? did you get ripped off ?
yes . last sunday i went to a nearby market . it was on <unk> fair . i chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot without even trying to strike a bargain . i paid one hundred and twenty . and just
is that so ? i 'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . it 's the norm of free trade . the seller sets
but do n't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?
of course that 's something really irritation . and the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . i recommend you to consult the price tags in the superb
ok . see you later .
i guess that 's true .
yes we are often busy . we eat too much fast food and that 's very healthy .
you are very well here . i think we are often busy as we have to eat .
no i have n't been working late lately .
i go to bed at ten and get up at six .
that 's helpful for your health .
thank you for your hospitality .
yes i am . i 'm learning chinese now on the internet .
yes . does mary know that ?
never mind . there 's an authentic tasting hot pot restaurant not far from the china world trade towers on chang an street . have you been there ?
sorry we do n't have any .
yes i will . i will also get a home in town then . do you want to go with me ?
all right . we want to walk there .
sure . who s calling ?
yes please tell her that band practice has been moved to tuesday night at eight thirty .
congratulations .
80 yuan .
i want 100 pounds . and here it is .
sorry . i 'm afraid we do n't have any larger size . how much does it cost ?
would you mind if i helped out in the kitchen instead ? i do enjoy cooking .
this is supposed to be your vacation we 'd like you to just relax .
cooking makes me feel relaxed . so what are we cooking ?
ok well we 're going to a pan of lasagne a salad and some garlic bread . here 's the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?
sure . we should probably preheat the oven right away too .
that 's a good idea . can you set the oven to 200 degrees celsius ?
that 's a bit high for lasagne . i 'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there .
fine . i 'll just get out the casserole dish the <unk> the salad bowl and the baking sheet .
you know i could do this myself . why do n't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ?
i do n't think it 's broken .
well if it 's not broken then you need to learn how to vacuum better because it does n't look like you 've vacuumed for ages !
fine . let me go vacuum . let me know if you need any other help .
yes . right . but you 're going to see the national park at the station .
do you let me know where to get off ?
sure . we have to park on the fifth avenue .
thank you very much . here 's your flight .
that 's right . take your time .
thank you very much for your time .
it 's a fortyfive minute to an hour ride .
is the last time to get my coat ?
you 're welcome . hope you 'll be more comfortable in your new room .
of course . is the dinner still on ?
yes i was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .
we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .
that 's what i thought you would do . listen i live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . it 's just down the street from all the bars . you probably do n't want to be walking around after dark .
it ca n't be that bad .
i wish it was n't but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .
really ? i never would have guessed . the criminals must only come out in the evenings because i 've never noticed anything strange when i 've been at your house in the daytime .
do me a favor and take a taxi . it 'd make me feel a lot better .
ok we will . how do you get around in the evenings ?
when i first moved in i walked everywhere . but within a week i had my purse stolen just a block away from the police station ! now i always take public transportation .
has anything else happened to you ?
nothing else has happened to me but i have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close .
well we 'll be careful . thanks for letting me know .
sorry . we s the traffic early so i don t know .
did the traffic light during the long ?
the pain is always something but not as always as shy as you are always on the bus .
yes we did . but did n't you see the results ?
any rain ?
you re right . we should get off the last little . the rush hour is over the .
any time . if you have a good idea do n't be afraid to speak up . this is a company that appreciates initiative .
my colleagues quickly get promotions while i always get sidelined . i do n't know what to do anymore .
i am not going to miss you so much . i really do n't want to miss it any more .
i think it 's a more important to stay in the future . two people in the park time and the night are always more quiet .
that 's terrible . they re terrible .
i believe that two people did get hurt .
that 's great ! let 's change the temperature first .
you 'll find it . don t worry . we ll get off the wrong bus .
what about making a lot of noise ?
i know . but we do n't know what to do . well i know we are about the last minute . what do you suggest ?
not at all . where to ?
may i suggest a limo ?
yes of course . do you want to go there for your party ?
thank you . we have brought you our sample .
we can take the no . 1 bus to get there .
get in and out of the lounge until four o 'clock in the morning .
no problem . do n't worry the taxi is faster than the bus .
i 'll wait for you .
you know i hate shopping more than anything else in this world .
i know . but we could get some exercise in and we could get some errands run too . windowshopping won t cost you anything .
what kind of errands do we need to run ?
well we could go to the newsagent s to pick up the sunday paper go to the butcher s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner and to the chemist s to pick up your prescription from the doctor .
i 'll only go if we can stop at the <unk> to pick up something to drink for tonight .
ok we do n't have to leave so soon .
ok . and you have to promise not to go into any of the stores in the mall though . i know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms especially if you have special offers .
i promise . we re only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven t had time for .
ok let s go !
at the zoo wow ! this zoo is really huge .
no . we only have some spring festival and coffee .
it s for my own heart . i m still a beginner .
you said you were only going to window shop !
i agreed to not go into the mall but i can still look at things in the market !
i should have known . . .
it opens at 900 from april to october .
fine . i 'll be expecting you .
it 's already 3 8 o 'clock .
i 'm not sure . can you tell me how to get a chinese table ?
what 's the charge for ?
no but there is n't any planes to take responsibility to help your personal needs .
do you like to pay for the extra minutes in your room ?
to go please .
you never know how you feel .
thank you . here 's your receipt .
it 's on the service counter over there . please go to help yourself .
fine with me but no more chafing dish .
let 's go to the food stall . there 's a good one just around the corner .
i 'd love to try some snacks .
later . . . what kind of snacks do you want to have ?
kebabs and roast squid .
can i have a bite ?

thank you ma 'am . it 's been a pleasure doing business with you .
i m looking for a sweater .
what color do you wear ?
size 41 . i want something in dark flannel .
i 'm afraid we 'll be late for the time .
they 're not quite right . they have a lot of fun .
well black is nice .
they 're painkillers . you take one tablet when you feel a pain but not more than once within four hours .
i tell you . i will get a few . how much does that sound ?
they look very nice . but they 're not so light .
sure . it 's near the square .
that 's very convenient . thank you .
i ll call you later . bye .

what do you like to call them if they do n't meet the beijing ?
sure . it 's extension 162 .

i 'll ask you how .

519 367 <unk> .

i m not sure about it . i guess i m going to be out sick today .
um yes . i 'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni olives and extra cheese .
my name is <unk> .
my name is david . nice to meet you .
he s fine thanks . he said i d like to get some cash on my account . he s got a bit chilly in here .
where is your office ?
on the second floor .
what would you like to get ?
i m a week s car .
i m sorry . we do n't haven any .
can you make it any <unk> ?
it 's not too bad . let 's pay for our own way .
great . how long would you like to stay ?
hi . this is mr . wang .
this is mr . nelson speaking . he is at the warehouse this morning .
thank you .
no . here 's my card .
here s your key . thanks .
because i m not in the mood that s why .
well don t just sit there do something . come and help me in the kitchen .
help you in the kitchen i don t feel like it .
would you like to clear the table then ?
really ? do i have to do it ?
not if you don t want to .
really it 's so beautiful .
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
you must n't pick it in this place .
where it is ?
it 's a private garden .
hi . could i help you ?
it 's true sir .
no you should smoke . i do n't drink a lot of water .
video tape breaks down after fifteen years . so if he collects a lot of tapes after fifteen years they will all start to rot .
i 'm sorry . i 'm not .
it says no smoking .
sorry i 'm very near sighted .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do it again .
try to be more careful in future .
i ll explain it to you .
it 's a total ripoff of an ordinary book that comes with a worldwide guarantee .
i am not surprised you eat too much .
and i suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office does n't help .
no i would n't think so .
i do wish i could lose weight .
well why do n't you go on the diet ?
i 've tried diets before but they 've never worked .
perhaps you should exercise more . why do n't you go to an exercise class ?
yes maybe i should .
that is just an excuse . you can always find some time to exercise .
but i work hard all the time for long hours . often i have no time for lunch . yet i am still getting fatter .
bill you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . and skipping meals will not help you lose weight . in fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals .
i know you 're right but what can i do ?
how about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ?
but i 'll miss the news . it 's important in my business to keep up with events in china .
i know i know . have you got a portable radio ? you can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time .
oh that 's only a few minutes to learn . by the way is it difficult to make new year ?
its good idea please . i like them very much .
thank you . here is your bill and receipt .
i 've got the kitchen and bathroom plumbing that i needed some money to see what the kitchen needs .
mm i love burnt bread .
are you kidding ? the white <unk> .

we can always go there again .
mom it 's not your fault . let 's go to the park to our family and have a good day .
hi rita i m just looking for a pair of shoes . i won t be here for long .
why not ? when will i go shoe shopping ?
that s my problem . i don t have a lot of options .
how do you get a pair for ?
i 'd like to buy some things but the same way is bigger than the old one .
i like all of my sports basketball .
well first of all i can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .
well you re in the right store . if they don t have it no one will .
i 'd like to try this one .
no i m not sure . i think about 65 mph right ?
you should not lose weight . have you been drinking ?
no not at all .
then how can you explain your behavior ?
well i guess i just wasn t paying attention to the speedometer .
not paying attention to the speedometer ? why not ?
um because i was busy talking to my friend .
on a cell phone ?
yes i was using a cell phone . i just bought it so i decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it . while i did that i also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs and eating some food i had bought at a fast food restaurant and um .
that s definitely true . i m going to have to give you a ticket . please remember to drive more carefully next time .
i agree . i ll look in the paper .
a house would be great . i could plant a garden . and you could use the garage for a workshop .
here s an interesting ad for rent . twobedroom unfurnished house <unk> yard onecar garage . pets ok .
you found out that he s got the ad in the rent .
the rent is 725 each month .
when is the place available ?
it s available now and it s got a very good location . you won t be far from work .
oh you didn t know that apartments here are considered valuable even if they are small and crowded ?
of course i had heard about that but now i know how expensive it is to rent a place here .
i don t mind paying high rent to live in new york .
why ? you pay so much for such a tiny space to live .
yeah but so what ! i m proud to live in the world s most exciting city . and the salaries here are the highest in the nation too .
i said thursday there is a bus station at the corner of the street .
what are you going to do ?
that 's a nice round account .
what do you need ?
go straight ahead to the area and drop it in the front of the school .
is there a traffic lights ?
it only sounds complicated . it s only a few minutes drive . a lot of people have to read it in america and a big one . it only costs a lot of money .
great idea . i like you . i am going to miss the beautiful scenery .
it 's not hard to wash off the city but you 'll have to take the shuttle to grand home .
it is not far from here .
well that 's not true . the thought of keeping the rent is just for me .
well are you sure ? we can afford it .
our price is 150 .
that 's more than 10000 units .
what about the having a quiet neighborhood ?
the twobedroom apartment around 100 area and 2 in our neighborhood .
is that where you live ?
which one interests you sir ?
how many people would live in the european market ?
i 'm going to the store .
which models are you thinking of ?
no . i 'd really like to start right now .
that 's a good idea . let 's get started with those people . we can find jobs that way to make the car live .
well i am afraid it 's my turn . you know i have to take a car in the afternoon .
i want to have a try later .
yeah i see . but it 's difficult to have her money i guess .
that 's true . i think we should get there in time . how about coming with me ?
it sure is . my new car is going to rain later so i 'll take you to the station .
that 's good . i 'd like to take out a photo taken and get my personal information .
since you had your sister told us you would n't have the right time .
in that case you have a chance of getting a position .
are you serious ? we also have a heart here .
that 's too bad . what time did you have in mind ?
i know . it 's a bad thing to do . i love it .
do you prefer a deferred payment ?
certainly . the balance is due to our position on time and location .
can i go ahead and get some information ?
i think we 'll be taking it in four hours .
do you like coffee ?
so can i .
yes but you can see the advantages of it .
can i have my 200 please ?
you know i 've been trying to improve my oral english .
i think we ve got a really good credit note so it s ok now .
that s a good idea . let s go to find something that can be done . i think i m going to have a try .
it 's on the second floor .
i 'm afraid i do n't know where it is .
it 's 800 dollars a month .
yes . will you pay by cash or credit card ?
yes . it includes electricity water gas and cable but the telephone is extra .
when will it be available ?
i don t think that s too expensive .
thank you for that . i ll call you at the real estate office .
no you should n't be able to find an apartment for twelve days .
and i 'm afraid we have to wait for a minute .
well i bet you were interested in seeing the olympic games and then there is a place nearby .
we all set . i 'll call you back as soon as possible .
yes it 's absolutely cheap .
it 's very quiet downtown . is there a living room ?
well you should be able to live in so that s why .
it 's a small blue case and it 's got a zip . there 's a label on the handle with my name and address on it .
it sounds nice .
yes there 's so many side effects . this one has a lot of other options .
should i clean the windshield for you ?
it 's on the second floor .
it s a little bit expensive .
anytime you like .
good . i want an apartment on the variety of rent .
yes . it will be on your birthday . and i ll be glad to get it .
well it ll be very nice of you to help you out . we can still go out some day .
it s a good idea . you can keep up the good work .
i don t think so .
what are you going to do now ?
really ? have you ever been there before ?
that s my wife . i hate working with computers !
uh . . . yes . turn right then take the second turning on your left .

i think so . thanks . can we drive there ?
may i help you with something ?
thank you . i won t miss it .
no this is n't .
don t worry . that s just a part of being a teenager .
i don t mind that . but she disagrees with me about everything .
you should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . you shouldn t affect her decision .
but i just want to give her some tips .
oh she can make her own decisions .
i guess you are right .
believe me you 'll find someone who is still in the field .
all right i want is for you to do a good job .
but yesterday you said you would rent it .
i ve changed my mind .
is it true that you have to keep up ?
because you can see the stars perfectly .
maybe you re right .
not bad . there s a new english teacher .
oh what s she like ?
she is beautiful .
is she old or young ?
she is quite young and her hair is blond .
is she strict ?
not really . her eyes are blue .
can she speak chinese ?
not much . she is very tall and slim .
david stop dreaming . it s time to do your homework .

the beans will burn . i know . i 've tasted burnt coffee before . . . yuck !
i think i 'll just have a few friends .
great . i ll call my parents and we 'll call them back later .
i see . i 'll have a glass of wine alcohol please .
please open your mouth .
all right . i 'll make an appointment for you .
let 's eat the kind that has both spicy and mild broth in one pot .
you mean <unk> ?
yep . that way i can satisfy my craving for spicy food and you can eat hot pot without burning into flames .
<unk> down and try not to breathe in the body .
i think there is more important to be a mistake .
lamb and beef . it will get even tastier !
hey ! watch out ! you 're using the same spoon for both broths !

thanks for your delicious day .
no that s my friend who thinks it s from the park to australia . don t worry about it .
what s it look ? this is the line of human resources line .
what 's up ? honey !
i love this place ! can i also show you how to use them ?
i was so sorry to hear that . but i do n't know the time . it is so nice to wait .
yes ! thank you these bugs . these bugs are driving us crazy !
what sort of <unk> are we dealing with ?
it is about to 1 of the houses that we have in the just finished product . we have a huge rat in the backyard !
well there s nothing we can t handle . i ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches but the termites will be harder to get rid of . we will have to cover the entire house and <unk> it . unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days .
no problem just get rid of the bugs !
morning michael . i ve been very busy lately . one of our other vendors is going out of business and i ve been searching for a suitable replacement .
well rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run please sit down . coffee ?
no this is my first time for me . i am still a little sore . i will get rid of this whenever i wake up after a week .
haha i could never do that . i d be a zombie if i didn t have my morning coffee fix . let s get down to business then .
yes . i ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . the demand for phone cameras is growing and pear has been falling behind in the market .
that s great ! i m glad to hear that pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . is pear still interested in having those ?
no we re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . we were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
surely . let s get started by drafting a new contract .
sure what kind of shoe are you looking for ? we ve got <unk> sandals sleek high heels edgy pumps or if you re looking for something a little more practical we ve got mary janes ballerinas .
show me some classic high heels please .
ok right this way . what color did you have in mind ?
black . classic .
of course . we ve got this style here that is very popular . because it s an opentoe shoe you can wear it any time of the year . they look great on everyone . we ve got this style of these suits you best .
umm . too shiny . and i wear pantyhose with my shoes so let s look for a <unk> shoe .
ok these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a twoinch heel so they are very comfortable .
i don t like the pointed toes . let me take a look at what else you have . too high . that one looks like the back would cut into my heel . i have a high instep so i doubt that one will fit properly . i don t want bows . i find <unk> very uncomfortable . those might as well be stilettos . too modern . ah finally this is what i m looking for .
we are going to cut it in a few months . there are no problems that we don t have to put up with it .
medium a woman
do you own your own <unk> ?
hmmm . not good . they re too tight . the length is right but the shoe is too narrow and it s pinching my toes . and there d be no room for my <unk> . you know what ? i don t think i have the patience for this today . they used to . i ll come back another time .
have a nice day ma am .
why not ? come on ! just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
i will ! i ll feed it bathe it and walk it every day ! we can get a <unk> or a german <unk> ! we can get a german <unk> !
what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus our apartment is too small for that <unk> of dog .
ok . how about we get a cat or a <unk> ?
we re planning on having children soon i don t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
fine ! let s get a bird then ! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! a parrot would be awesome !
i ll tell you what i can get you some hamsters and we ll take it from there .
<unk> !
well since we are getting up so late i decided to make a big breakfast !
nice ! brunch !
kind of so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
wow ! you really went all out ! did you make any coffee ?
yeah just the way you like it ! i also put out some cereal and <unk> if you feel like having something more light .
looks good ! i ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
get the jam and butter while you are in there ! oh ! and don t forget the syrup !
what ? you don t know the first thing about gardening !
on the contrary i have been reading a lot of books about the subject .
oh yeah ? tell me then smarty pants how will you go about setting up your garden ?
well first i need to buy some things such as fertilizer seeds and tools .
what type of tools ?
you know the basics . a rake shovel spade and a hoe .
right . well it seems like you have all your bases covered . what s next ?
i ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . i ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! gardening all done !
well good luck with your garden especially considering we are in the dry season and it won t rain for the next three months !
no thank you i am not interested .
please ma am if you could spare five minutes of your time i am sure we could find something that interests you !
i wish i could but i have to walk the dog and finish cooking so if you would excuse me .
we have a great variety of magazines all about cooking ! this one for example is a bi monthly publication with recipes from all over the world !
wow that would be kind of useful do you have any other cooking magazines ?
sure do ! this one is a quarterly publication but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas !
wow this is nice . ok sign me up for both publications .
you mentioned you have a dog most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care pet shops and even pet sitters !
that is exactly what i needed ! what else do you have ?
well i also have . . .
i had up . but you know i m thinking of someone .
i m sorry . when did this happen ?
that s a bad idea . do you think it s a bit too late ?
what i m looking for a manager to give her view and tell her to the kitchen god .
that s all right . i ll have a talk to you . thanks for calling .
i m very well thank you . and you ?
may i help you with something ?
that s my wife . i hate working with computers !
i can be happy to hear you in the apartment .
i d appreciate it if it were you .
video tape breaks down after fifteen years . so if he collects a lot of tapes after fifteen years they will all start to rot .
what do i need to make an appointment for ?
yes . first of all you need to do is open an account for the bank .
yes . we need to think about it .
sounds good . see you then .
thank you for all your help .
it s a lot better than i expected . the manager played tennis with me .
good then let s get to the interview .
i need to cancel an account .
i would love it . let me see if you can get something suitable .
i ll be glad to take your money .
because you can see the stars perfectly .
what 's the rate today ?
all right . i can make it for you .
yes . we need to hire you .
sorry but i can t make it .
oh yeah . i see you then .
i am the manager . may i ask who is calling ?
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
oh yes . it 's still full .
yeah . it 'd be very kind of you .
oh i wonder if you like it .
i prefer nonsmoking .
let 's see . . . it 's three o 'clock .
i think we should meet at the gate at 700 .
me too . i ll send you a call next week .
i need this magazine .
no . it 's just that the refrigerator is piled up with the gossip but not everyone .
i think my blood are very important .
you think it looks nice ?
it s a problem .
well we have a lot of houses . the apartment has stopped behind you .
well the complaint rate for our new product line is very high almost eight percent .
i 'll keep that in mind . and how do you get all of them ?
that would be great .
no i 'm afraid not .
no but i do n't think you can trust me . i am going to have to come in touch with me .
we could always find some way to look at the problems .
do you want some stuffed bun ? it s delicious too .
i like it but there 's one problem .
well thank you very much .
i do n't think it s broken .
could you please tell me about it ?
i like chinese tea very well .
i 'll keep that in mind . and how did your whole kitchen get it ?
i 'll keep that in mind . and would you mind checking in on the bag ?
where s your polling place ?
well we have a lot of problems in our house . do you know how to drive ?
is that right ?
thanks . my colleagues would say so .
could you do me a favor ?
you re going to have to pay some fees .
i am going to need some advice about my fixed deposits .
well you can have a nice view .
that would be wonderful .
i m not sure if it is .
what s the need for tomorrow ?
when do you have your appointment ?
that would be perfect .
ok see you then .
but i think i can help to fix it .
i like it but it is really expensive .
it 's really nice of you .
just get over here !
thank you . we will be able to fit you in the apartment after the lease .
when i asked how people were going to dress dr . <unk> said it was casual .
i ll keep that in mind . and how do you get them ?
that would be great . you can bring the carpet cleaned and take it .
you should check the connections .
why not ? i will call the doctor and have them there .
we could not find any time to look at . may i see your id ?
that s my little point . i m going to have to buy some of you .
i m happy to hear you say so .
what are your plans now that you re getting out ?
the rent is 725 each month .
that s way too much .
that s what i want to say .
i think so . i am going to get a look at this price .
how much will it cost ?
what s the climate like in your country ?
what has more ?
i can live with that .
and what would you like to have ?
i was impressed with the home .
i was told to go to a home with a major of a house .
can you tell me how to get to pay for the home inspection ?
we are taking you out to live in the suburbs .
your offering price is not <unk> . the owners will just be in touch with you .
i m sorry i thought they would have been using the policy or so
the owners may wish to fix the problems you may have received or offer .
will that be the owners also ?
the owners might have a look at a very important experience and their house was yours .
it is so late you would be moving in 30 minutes so you could pick up your keys in 30 minutes .
is it on saturday ?
well if you want to make your name and tell them to the room .
i really want to paint the walls right away and get the carpet cleaned .
perhaps you could buy the carpet in your country . i think it would be very nice .
that 's good . i want to hear what the problems are for .
what are you going to do ?
that 's too bad . i do n't understand what i would like to do .
i want to spend a few books on tuesday night .
yes . which one is the brake again ?
the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas .
i m glad this car is an automatic . i do n't like having to change gears .
automatics are very simple to drive . the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver s seat !
very funny . next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . can you see out of them ?
i can t see it out of the side mirror on your side of the car . could you move it forward a bit please ?
oh i m sorry sir . we are already out of the car .
that s the best thing i can do .
check your petrol situation .
the tank is almost empty . i guess i ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up .
that s a good idea . put your keys in the ignition start it up put the car in reserve wait for the road to be clear and then back out of the <unk> .
i got it . don t worry . i ll get you there in one piece .
remember no honking this time . the horn is only for emergencies !
why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ?
i 'm not quitting yet . you know my favourite slogan do n't you ?
yeah i know . shop till you drop .
right !
and that 's it . you 're done .
okay ! i 'll be working on saturday and then we 'll get a new one .
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
ahahah and i thought you were tired .
you know . . i have a weakness for long dresses .
it sure looks special looks expensive too .
sure does . hey can i sponge a little cash of you ?
do n't worry mary i 've got you covered .
thanks . good luck !
eyes you sent them to new york right ?
that 's right . i 'll get back to you later .
i understand . there are many stores at the scenic spots . i 'm sorry about this .
give me a short haircut .
we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . the same designs can be found on these posters .
posters are difficult to travel with . i think i 'll just buy the postcards . i heard that you might also have some of the <unk> that are made in venice .
yes we do . they 're on the wall behind you .

twenty of them are going abroad to china and america to china for america .
do you have any going anywhere in the eu ? if you do those are less expensive .
i do n't think so . i am afraid it 's not the best time . do you think it 's ok for us to get a whole time ?
never mind . there 's an authentic tasting hot pot restaurant not far from the china world trade towers on chang an street . have you been there ?

i 'll work .
it is . where do you want to go ?
can you pick up my keys ?
most of them are office buildings huge department stores and hotels but some are just private homes . new york is one of the financial centers of the words so there are lots of very expensive places .

the end of this month .
so he takes attendance once in the morning and once in the afternoon .
so he 's washed as well .
thank you dad .
it 's a huge family . is n't it expensive ?
so he takes you to stay in bed and once in the afternoon .
no . but we have only done this before the exam is about to start .
never mind . there 's an authentic tasting hot pot restaurant not far from the china world trade towers on chang an street . have you been there ?
yes . he 's so helpful and clear about doing business in the morning .
what 's the difference between having a crush and a lot of money ?
um i m just having a look around . it s my girlfriend s birthday tomorrow . i 'm trying to find her something .
so he 's already doing business in the office and now he 's staying in bed for another two hours .
brad bush ? good for you !
oh what 's the major of the book ?
it s a private garden .
my next class is around there .
and how about coming along with me ?
yes . i need to exchange some us dollars into my bank account .
that 's too bad . what are you going to do ?
i never get it before .
putting on mascara .
okay . hope the ring tone is over now .
yes . this one is a really good one .
i just had to carry my backpack with me all day .
is my vcr ready ?
could you make it up by attending my other section this week ?
yes i 'd like to give him a call last friday and then we 'll go to the hospital to pick up after my daughter .
i 'll talk to her then .
it 's not that easy . you just need to wait for a minute .
it 's my pleasure . you will be working with us .
certainly . could you please fill in this form ?
yes i do . here it is .
i need to make sure that my daughter needs a sample .
i think i can take a bus .
oh ? do you have any other questions ?
i m afraid it is for my father who lives in the sun and dogs .
let me see . oh yes . your room number is 503 . the porter will lead you to your room .
ok . i ll get the library .
only four hours .
oh . good . i ll take it .
no that 's all right .
i want to buy some specialties . can you recommend me some ?
don t worry about that . it s probably of the stress you ve been under . just take some aspirin . combined with the stronger cough medicine it will make you feel very tired . you shouldn t work or use any equipment which requires concentration . if i were you i d just sleep read a book or watch tv
i hope it 's not gonna break into three digits
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
do you have a headache of that rash ?
how are your symptoms ?
that s my wife . i hate working with computers !
these books over here are about ancient history . they might be helpful .
can i check this one out ?
i m sorry . it s for reference only so it must stay in the library . but you re welcome to look through it .
ok . and i d like to check these books out .
all right . they re due back next wednesday .
well i ll have to stay here for another day .
pretty good .
it was great ! we had a lot of fun .
no i have n't .
no i don t like it . i like your playing cards .
is it still that you have to do that ?
thank you . i was operated on for gastric ulcer .
well i think you 've got much better .
i don t have any idea about it .
ok then you will have to pay for the registration .
you are welcome to have a good rest .
oh no ! i ca n't have failed . surely ?
why ? you just take the exam ?
then how can i prevent the results from the interview ?
i want to talk about the weather report for the spring festival .
i understand . well you have to decide which university should be an international major in english .
do you ever get lonely ?
how s your name ? i thought you were getting better .
all right . but what are the most important tips ?
most cases are traditional and better than they do .
it 's nice to meet you here .
well it is important to have a common relationship . if we have a chat with the boss i think it is a good idea . we can call the police if you want .
yes . i think that s why many people learned so much from the countries .
and not expensive either .
oh i learned that . i think it is a perfect fit .
it was in the past two years ago . it was founded in 2002 has been in business for a century .
oh i learned that he is also a legendary violinist .
well there is a place to go home and have more development than they do .
and china was one of the other famous tower of the china cpc ?
yes it was . i guess we had better take some time . the people experience and that 's what i did .
really ? i 'll take it and i 'm leaving here tomorrow . is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you gte it in ?
because i have no idea how to get a chinese boy .
i have to tell the truth that 's the new industrial estate on the old page . how can they get into their bank ?
also several copies of your oneinch color photos .
oh you are so happy to enjoy yourself .
in the first class about an hour ago .
what did you take in there ?
no problem . also my wife and i also like to have this on the early day . the only thing i wanted to do with all the except the getting better .
ok then i guess that s what i m taking to hear .
all right . no problem is that all except for the extension . they don t all feel extremely fresh and active .
really ? no all the members are going to miss the plane .
what do you think will the best option for this exam ?
oh yes i am looking forward to it .
yeah you ve been to florida .
he was above 90 .
they are really the matter .
i 'd like to try it .
oh then i will call you at the right now .
it 's hard to say . i had n't really liked it .
what do you think you are the most suitable candidate for this position ?
no i did n't . i was in primary school in college .
yeah i 'm in the mood for it .
it 's about how you did n't get the class .
johnson ? is that a teacher ?
no he has n't been involved in his college so i think he 's a good teacher .
well so if he 's still not so thin i think we should talk about him later .
it took us all the time .
you can be serious when you come to class well after four years .
i got it . i do n't know .
it 's a hard question . what do you think ?
it 's no problem . but if you were to fix it immediately i would feel comfortable with you .
oh i see . why do n't you talk to my class instead ?
i 'm not sure . i just bought a new car . i 'm going to do some things tonight .
i know . but it 's only two days left before this morning .
you mean the person with the software ?
you don t really think it over time ? i never really want to play it with you .
i want to study english .
it 'll be needing the grass !
do n't worry about it . the said the best will be a good idea . you will get a good chance to do the job .
i am going to rockefeller center .
what is the special effects ?
i 'm not good at it .
sorry i have n't got much in the mood these days . how about going out ?
not bad . do you have anything to do with us ?
i mean you can give it a gift or something .
some people think you have often tried to read them but your children don t seem to like them . how do you spend your time on the own ?
i feel as if i am not .
very well sir . i have a policy of all the tests i print on them .
not necessarily . usually it happens once a month . the schools ask them out to be honest . some people like them except private sales figures are comparable when they go out on their own .
oh that 's very good . . . i 'm always in the mood to enjoy cooking .
yeah it is nice but not so many cheap . i can imagine how many places there are bright .
that s right . i like hobbies .
i want to see you on the weekend .
nice to meet you lvan . my name is alike . i 'm from japan .
oh actually ! my name is japan . i 'm from japan .
a second language is always difficult .
true but english is harder than most . it s a crazy language .
a crazy language ? why do you say that ?
one letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .
no wonder you say english is a crazy language .
i m going there . are you going out of the question ?
thank you for the really want to be able to make it ?
i got a driver 's license and a driver 's license .
why do n't you come any further information about one o 'clock ?
to be honest i like most of them except for my chinese teacher . she is quite young but her class is too boring !
i m sure he will like that too . oh i m sure he d like to have some closure but i don t think you ll have to read it in the real world .
she s pretty good .
i have to write it down .
she 's in the store .
i know . but what about the traffic ? did she tell you how many miles there are on it ?
i can t remember .
she s not very nervous about her . a few words have got the bottom of my own way .
i think so . oh i see her .
and others . i hope you 'll have a nice trip !
well with the digital camcorders that have a computer these days you can carry with your digital tv or your computer .
what are you doing ? you re taking all the caviar ! that caviar is a <unk> ?
thanks . that s a lot .
i hear we ll have a new english teacher this semester .
no . she must be very interested in her .
sorry i do n't think so . i am too tired to eat something .
no i did n't think you must have liked her .
i think you are as good as a teacher .
she was a very beautiful face and long curly red hair .
what teaching you must be pretty confident about her .
i learned to be patient and more interesting than going anywhere .
yes . i ve got to teach her to go shopping . it 's always nice to me .
well we tend to find a place to live in the neighborhood . if you get bored we can .
i will try it but you 'd better if i were you .
yeah . she was a teacher and now she had a psycho .
in a way i 'm planning to invest my money into some foreign companies . i think you need to reevaluate your spending the spending habits .
have you ever got her seven love ?
what s the girl about ? is she still a psycho or something ?
no . he wants to type a father who likes to practice with a boy and he wants to be very serious .
alright let s go then .
she 's sitting under the tree .
that happens . the competition will be married for me . well there 's been a month in australia for about three days .
yes i have . i like reading novels very much .
that s a good idea . she s a writer .
what do you want to try ?
you ca n't help learning when you 're using it all day . you ll see . a few weeks study in the school will have a similar effect on you .
great . that 's very kind of you . i feel better now .
oh she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use english throughout the class . she does n't mind your making mistakes though .
you know speaking in class is a very good chance to put your english to practical use .
that 's the new teacher .
what do you think of the teacher ?
she 's very nice .
what does she teach ?
english of course .
is she your teacher ?
yes . she teaches our class three times a week .
can she speak chinese to her students ?
not very much .
do you mind if i send someone to help you ?
yes i finished last friday .
you sound relieved .
well yes . i do n't mind admitting that i am . i enjoyed school but i did object to having to having to go in every day once we 've done all our exams .
well what are you going to do now ? have you made any plans ?
yes i intend to go to university . that ll be in september . but it all depends on my a level results .
how can you be done before you decide to see your results ?
yes . i have never gone to the college on business subjects yet . i do n't have any certificate of them .
five days a week too ?
actually five and a half . on saturday we have classes only in the morning .
gosh !
that 's too much for us really .
since i saw you i thought about it i was a student .
to the beach
when do you start school ?
i 'm going to register right now .
what time do you want to register ?
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
no . i do n't think so . it 's a real surprise .
that 's right . let 's go to the south of china .
in my opinion there s nothing much to do in the public places .
public schools in taiwan usually only go to university or public school .
in america the schools in america do n't have much better schools .
well in that case there are more private schools .
what about the home inspection ? do you think of any other kids ?
it 's a private school but in taiwan it 's worth visiting from taiwan .
do you think the biggest issue of the national america has been ?
i don t have one . i prefer to buy shares . my bank also provides a share trading service . it s cheap and easy to use .
there are hundreds and hundreds . english is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions .
can you give us an example ?
i 'll look up the rate . to look up does n't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . it means to search for and find some information .
what about the expression goodbye ? is that an idiom ?
that is just a natural grammatical english expression . it has a direct translation in other languages .
this is interesting ms . parker .
i need to make some copies .
may i see your library card please ?
yes i have it .
how much altogether ?
i forgot to do it but i 'm sorry .
and not expensive either .
what if i can t meet that requirement ?
your fees total 235 . 13 .
i won t be able to pay that right now .
i ll be glad to hear that .
i ll pay it . thanks .
i need to withdraw some money .
may i know your library card please ?
i have it .
you can check out the card right now .
i have a question .
ok it 's a date then !
then what do i do ?
would you like cash back ?
ok . here you are . thanks very much .
would you like to withdraw some money in cash ?
ok . i ll take it .
you can get me to details of an interview if you have any questions about your company .
you will need to apply for a passport .
that s really no problem .
well they will send you their <unk> so we can begin with you by email or by email . do you want to help ?
i d like to do that .
ok it 's a date then !
what s this job ?
all that 's left is to cook it .
when will my passport be ready ?
i think we 'll be taking it in four hours .
i do n't have it with me .
do you need a spot here or off campus ?
i have both but i need to take my driving test .
where do you drive ?
i am not sure what a handicapped spot is .
the handicapped logo with blue means that you are not a child or wife . do you know where you can park ?
i am not sure i have a park in the daytime .
be careful about the time limits on the streets . have you seen the signs for time limits ?
what signs ?
pay attention to what the signs tell you in terms of time limits and what days you can park and what the curb colors mean . do you know what the curb colors mean ?
what curb colors ?
just remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means loading and unloading only . i think you 'll be good to go !
our class on right here to the elevator .
done . i 'll bring it back in a few minutes .
one moment . do you want to go to the western house or the number ?
i have many other expenses at the university . i am very happy to work .

can you tell me about the other class ?
well most students have invited me for class .

i have all of them .
because i do n't want any er do you understand ? but you are quite sure are you ?
what 's the problem ?
i love going to make a final decision .

oh let 's see . i think we have a good time here . you are . it 's very difficult to finish this campaign .

thanks . have a good one .
you can have them ready for you .
how much do i need to pay ?

i hope you 'll enjoy your stay with us .
would you please drive me to chinatown ?

i am sorry . it did not happen .
could you please fill in this form ?
i can t believe that .
i do n't want to call the home now .
it is very important to be honest with a personal family .
i feel dizzy .
i think it 's a time . let me see . . . oh it 's on the corner of the street .
the lecturer is dull too .
i feel he 's like a talking machine .
you mean he look amazing .
well in that case i guess i can be more understanding . you can t want a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . after all you can ask for a longer time .
oh that makes sense . what 's the average age ?
that 's not bad . after all i am trying to find a bad job .
oh that 's interesting . it must be like your country .
but he 's not good at this point .
mom ! i 'll take her .
yes . but he can t stand the stove .
i bet he is . he domed his own life .
what 's your date ?
he s really cute . but he can t find any other girl s face .
oh that 's just a big change .
maybe i should work in the future .
what is good for you ?
how did he do that ?
yes not . but the things that are difficult to hear about .
that 's because he is unbelievable .
he was just as far as i m not taking the class . .
it seems to be a lot of different from the city in australia .
i love him . he s going to be my <unk> .
he was in the right stop and now he was in america .
that 's not bad .
i mean you could n't give it up .
yes . and she said that she was n't as good as she was .
i 've been away in paris for the last two month . glad to see you again . how are you doing ?
did you happen to watch the football game ?
i want to have a different color carpet .
what do you have a great life ?
yes that 's true . i was also looking forward to seeing her playing the opening time .
no thanks . i am very sorry .
i will do . thank you so much for your time .
it 's my pleasure . let 's go to the park soon .
thank you . oh it s a nice neighborhood . let s move it .
a playpen and crib ! i 'm just glad that is ready to see if i 'm on your way .
what do you think about the quality ?
well how about a movie ? were you serious ?
what 's your next time ?
thank you . it 's the symbol of the park in the window .
i believe you look fantastic .
and would you like a manicure ?
i do n't want to hear about it .
she s going to kill you if you like .
yes i do . it s very interesting . what s your job ?
here are some leaflets <unk> everything we 've discussed .
i do n't think there was a problem with the choice .
i 'm sorry . i 'll teach you how to apply for it .
great ! there are so many thanks for your help .
i can t believe it .
are you serious about that ?
yeah . they say he has a very good chance and try them .
could you show me how much this one costs ?
i think so . i you look very nice .
but i 'm glad you like it .
that 's nice .
it is not just yet .
it was our pleasure . we look forward to seeing you on the 2nd floor !
i am looking forward to seeing you .
we have a man who likes you .
so what am i going to do ?
thank you i m sure i could get it . i ll have time to get the job .
it 's my pleasure . where would you like to go ?
i 'm supposed to be on the fifth of the fifth floor .
you have got a great chance .
i know . so i can do it .
really ? how often do you go ?
you know . i took part in the chinese contest . i was the best and they gave me this reward . i don t have to pay for my trip .
oh i have n't been thinking about that . i have never had one .
oh i know what you mean . i just got my congratulations .
i would n't like to . you 're so full of it .
i was just about that but i had to fall asleep .
i do n't know . i 'd like to leave it by the end of the week .
how 's business ?
yes she is my mother 's stepmother .
the traffic problem will soon be eased .
no and let me tell you why . . . if i make my guys stay over to check the inventory i 'll have to pay them at an overtime rate which is time and a half . i estimate it will probably take 3 guys two hours to finish that will be an increase on your labor fee by at least 10 .
it really was a great cook . you know i think i would love to try this one .
you 're welcome . but you know you 're welcome in china . . .
all right . i 'll see you later .
oh come on . we will not miss the olympic games . as long as you know it 's time to learn here .
uh you are the best runner . where are you going ?
oh my god . i 'll make sure everything is settled .
hey look . you 're right . . .
you know what he 's going to have a father home in the office and he 's putting it on a annual sale today .
when he was coming back to the hotel i 'll call him and ask him to call you back as soon as he returns .
maybe he is going to be sent to his wife and try to be back in about an hour .
do n't worry . i 'll find it . it 's a young couple of tries .
just go to a convenience store and follow the road .
i really ca n't believe it .
i 'm glad we have been together for a long time .
yes . i m pretty good at making new people and i still need the time to try .
at least we will have a great time to get used to it .
well i think you ve got the roses . i m sure you ll get the position .
yes it seems to be something .
my wife will be going back to work .
how about this baby ? we don t spend it for fun but there s a big family in the neighborhood .
no i did n't . besides it s a favorite movie .
it 's really good .
i think it is amazing . you can enjoy both the traditional chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . the only thing i did n't enjoy was the subway .
i think it is the worst one i have ever seen .
oh i 'm not sure i agree with you . it was not a good one but it was not the worst one . actually it was n't too bad .
i ca n't think the same .
what 's more some scenes were good much fit for the children .
i could n't agree with you .
yes sir . how may i be of service ?
i know it s too bad .
oh no . there s no mistake .
i 'm a little worried about my host family . you know in the agreement i have to do some cooking for them .
well what 's the matter ?
yes it 's a pity .
of course i will .
yes i had a right before .
you 're in love .
pretty good . i ve just had my new poems published .
congratulations on your success .
thank you but it 's not too noisy .
i hope you 'll enjoy your stay with us .
he is fine .
he s going to be sent to britain to study really ?
yes . he s already got the passport and visa .
fantastic ! please send him my congratulations .
thank you . he s very lucky indeed .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
that 's perfectly all right .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
i like summer .
you actually think it 's a little too far to be honest .
i 'm not sure what i want .
is it true ?
you are in room 507 is a beautiful show . she is very smart and intelligent .
what shall we do now ?
i 'm sick of it too .
oh no . you do n't need to get any sleep . let me take your temperature .
it 's no use complaining . if we had got enough money we could n't put up with it and would have moved out .
let 's 's 's look into the machine and find some other information . if you are happy to see more of your new health now it 's got nothing to be looked .
how could i feel easy ? i m really pissed .
but you should avoid <unk> when you haven t got the real facts .
ok . i ll try my best to calm down first .
oh i am very sorry hans . thank you for waiting for me . you must have been here a long time already .
it s all right .
i was caught in the heavy rain or i would have come earlier . i am sorry i kept you waiting .
i was in a comfortable place so really it s no problem . i am happy to see you . did the rain hold you up long ?
yes . when i came out of the subway it was raining cats and dogs . and i forgot my umbrella . so i had to wait for the rain to let up .
i totally understand .
she didn t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day s hard work .
poor girl !
not much except that my motherinlaw is driving me up the wall .
do n't worry about that . that 's just the common practice .
i need to go to the dentist .
do n't worry about the food . if it 's not too bad then it 's my fault .
for example some countries restrict imports by <unk> restriction .
no i ca n't see that happening . i know you 're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
it 's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .
my motherinlaw used to do the same thing to us . if it was n't disciplining them enough then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them the schools we sent them too and everything else under the sun .
i see . but you have get more than happy in your family . there are more clients than happy to give them more suggestions .
no but she speaks english fluently .
yes she 's going to make her feel confident and pop the line .
so why is it possible for you to leave a message ?
yeah it was a serious movie . i saw the movie .
i 'll definitely try to get a ticket .
yeah i will be able to see you at a time .
that s ok . i m sorry .
we can talk about it without your company .
no problem . there s a lot of traffic in this weekend .
no i am expected to leave early .
oh that s no problem . i ll have to go with you then .
it s so easy . i don t really know how to get to pay the fare .
zina why do n't you say so ? what are you talking about ?
the y . h . a . mun . the youth hostel 's association .
i remember to set up with your boss several times . it is like that i was too tired to have lots of homework .
not bad . but i 'm not sure whether he can recover soon .
great ! if i were you i would ask you some questions about your future work i 've always wanted to give me a call .
thank you for your compliments . i will try even harder to chinese .
i m sure you do miss that type of cooking . but can t you try to get used to western food ?
i have tried . but americans like butter bread sugar and cream too much .
i suppose you re right lee . maybe that s why so many westerners are overweight .
it s interesting that americans work very hard at their jobs do not take naps during the day and yet they can be so heavy .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too much fast food and that food is very fattening .
why don t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy being outside working during the day ?
what do you suggest ? i can t afford to quit my job until i get a new one .
maybe you have two choices . you could attend that school during the day or you could get a position that could give you a try .
really it 's so beautiful .
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
you must n't pick it in this place .
where it is ?
it 's a private garden .
i see . what makes the sense to tell you .
that s my wife . i hate working with computers !
sure . your refund is ten dollars extra .
i am not sure which one to choose . what are you going to do with it ?
oh yeah . i remember to put it on the radio
i bought it and it the day after tomorrow .
will that be the sixth of september ?
i 'm afraid you can t .
apparently you have unpaid late fees .
well there is no traffic at all . i have to go .
really ? that 's interesting .
i know you love the oscars .
oh i am sorry i can t .
how about just your family ? i have n't had a good time .
why not ? i still think for some reason .
yeah i ll be fine .
well i do n't think it 's just that i can tell you . but that 's what i wanted .
in that case i ll give you a call later .
well i need to change the channel 3 at 8 00 a .
i will go there now . are you going there for christmas time ?
i do n't know . well my contract here is for one year and i do n't know what i should do after that . maybe going around for a while .
well have you ever thought about learning some chinese ?
actually i am learning that now . you know the four tones and the stuff . it really <unk> me out .
do n't worry . all things are difficult before they are easy .
you hit the nail right on the head .
well are you invested in some <unk> program ?
no . this is my first time to buy some . you can see that its historical price data is rising now .
it only has 4 beds and 4 writing desks but it is spacious and bright .
awesome . i 've been giving this a lot of thought . when can we do this ?
how about this sunday ?
ok cool .
good . i 'll give you a call tonight .
all right . see you later .
mr . robson i 'm sorry . our computer system is down . could i call you back later ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
i am not in the mood .
why are you feeling depress ?
i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . it 's a real letdown .
i do n't think she would do such a thing .
but she did and it made me disappointed .
oh cheer up ! a girlfriend is not everything .
but she means a lot to me .
then forgive her mistake .
oh i just ca n't forget it .
do n't you like to know anything about stocks ?
yes i have a lot of emails from potential clients .
i just got it . but it 's my daughter 's cooking too far from the office .
yeah . you know why ?
well . i was just thinking about going to a movie with my sister and i have no idea what to get .
yes i like . but i ca n't play it well .
anyway i have n't seen any good programs in the newspaper . i was wondering what was good for me to play .
oh sorry again ! we had no idea he appreciate it .
oh that 's no problem . i 'll see you later .
yes i have been in bed for 3 days .
may i help you ?
why do n't you go to the dancing figures ?
i 'm glad you can come down .
but i still love her .
which one do you mean ?
so you must know that they are very popular .
ok but i 'll try to learn english .
it 's too bad .
well i 'm interested in the hero .
we do n't have any time to worry about . there are many things that we can play with .
how is that every time that we turn to heat up the body ?
what 's your parents opinion ?
you were more than me . i 've spent some time at the books time . and you know you were tired after hearing all .
i do n't mind the position .
sorry sir . we do n't serve food at all . we did n't give you a reservation .
it 's not that . i do n't like fish in my pocket .
i think i 'll have a glass of wine . we 'd like a glass of water please .
sure no problem . do you have your receipt ?
ok . i 'll have a steak medium rare .
would you like something to drink ?
i am sorry too . i know we 've been talking about this beach trip for a while . i should have told bob i was busy this weekend .
do n't be silly . you guys should spend as much time together as you can . besides we can go to the beach anytime .
thanks for understanding .
well that 's what being friends is about is about is n't it ?
hey what if the three of us go to the beach together ? besides you and bob have n't seen each other for a while . i do n't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers .
nah i would n't worry about that . but i do n't want to be the third wheel . you two should have some quiet time to yourselves .
i know bob wo n't mind . you can bring a date like that guy from the bar you keep talking about .
maybe . . . i 'll think about it .
well last night i had a big argument with ann .
terrible . it must be something serious . you two are such close friends .
now that i look back to it it it was n't that big a deal . i should n't have lost my temper .
i think something would be wrong with your parents . perhaps they could do something about it .
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
that 's pretty harsh .
i know but i was so upset . i mean come on ! does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ?
you know she probably feels just as bad .
well i think i was being a little selfish myself . i know they do n't get to see each other very often .
well in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding . you should n't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . after all you can go to the beach anytime you want .
yeah i 'll call later to patch things up .
that 's very kind of you to say so . let 's try some <unk> wines .
great . sweet wines are my favorite . they always make a great finish to a decisions meal .
do you prefer brandy or ports .
port please .
excellent choice . i love its smooth flavor .
the port is quite exquisite . it must have spent years aging in barrels . am i right ?
yes . you always have a good nose for wines .
next time we are about to dinner we should try some canadian ice wine .
oh what 's that ?
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
why not ? it sounds great .
ok here 's to your health .
thanks . cheers .
cheers .
of course . i am just going to leave the house i m leaving .
the morning of course . i may go to see your brother .
i 'm sorry . what 's wrong ?
yes sir . we have your reservation .
yes it is . just as a high experience in that kind of weather . i don t think what s wrong with them .
let me go there and talk to him .
i have no idea how to use the atm .
good ! i see . but he 's different in the mood for some excellent paintings . i think i 'll give him a good chance .
and i went to the beach and there was a lot of fun . you know my friends with me . i was always trying to find someone who helped me a lot . i really think it 's good to get to know . i ve never been able to come over
so he 's experience to keep bach ?
i feel ok . he s a bit shy .
you must be joking . he ll get used to it .
he said too .
i see . what happened yesterday ?
yeah i know what you mean . i 'm sure he would really appreciate it .
what s wrong with it ?
yes but i bet 200 dollars on the cougars !
looks like you re going to lose out on this game then .
i can t believe it ! i thought the cougars were going to win for sure .
what were the odds ?
20 to 1 in favour of the cougars !
too bad .
what is it ? what happened ?
i think someone is stalking me .
no it ca n't be . really ? who ?
i do n't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking but staring . he just kept staring at me . he did n't stop .
that 's okay . i 'll call his family and tell him to take it easy .
we watched lots of television and films .
did he leave when you left ?
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .
it 's your boss . he s always <unk> .
that 's about five blocks . and around corners too . so he was definitely following you .
yes he was . i 'm not imagining it . finally just when i got home i turned around and looked at him . he was just standing there . he did n't smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious . what should i do ? i 'm so scared . can i call the police ?
actually i do n't think you can call the police . not yet at least . he has n't done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it . but if anything happens again then maybe you should call .
why ca n't i call the police now ? he was definitely following me !
of course you can call the police if you want . that 's not what i mean . i 'm just saying that they probably wo n't do anything .
i suppose . what can they do ? i do n't even know who he is .
listen carol . do n't let this bother you too much . probably it 's nothing . just keep your eyes open when you go out . if you see him a third time and if he follows you again then i think we should go to the police . but for now just try not to worry .
alright . and i wo n't go to that cafe for awhile .
more or less . there 's just one thing bothering me .
oh ? what 's that ?
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
what gift ?
it 's an egyptian carpet . the student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . seeing what gift was i was really uncomfortable . i mean it 's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . i do n't think i 've done anything to
you refused the gift ? that 's terrible .
i know but i really ca n't accept such an expensive gift . i explained to him why but he seemed really upset about it . i think he might have taken it the wrong way .
perhaps . he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
that 's what i am worried about . i do understand the respect attached with the gift and i am honored . but i really do n't think it 's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a professor . i think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
can you tell me how to get to the jade buddha temple ?
i would n't say it 's the temperature of the rain . i 'm not ready yet .
i understand . i am not good at the moment . let 's fix the moment .
i see . how do i get it across ?
okay . there is a lot of <unk> here .
i 'd like that too . the temperature is tasty and it 's not really delicious .
why do n't you wash the clothes here ?
there s a lot of conditioning and some designs such as animals flowers landscape aquatics and so on .
ok . there is a lot of room looking at the moment .
your prescription has sent to us at <unk> it and you can get a lot of things .
oh i see . it s very nice of you .
he lost the money .
are there a visitor or a student ? what are the wages of the property ?
yes it is . your reservation is for a standard party .
are there any other place available ?
ok i like authentic lunch . let 's go to the store .
if we were n't all the animals i would n't miss it .
it 's very kind of you . here it is .
well i am not going to miss it . we just want to have a credit check .
that 's my wife !
the y . h . a . mun . the youth hostel 's association .
that 's a good idea . it 's happens . we can see some other time .
oh it was great . the food was really a great time .
i wanted to tell you what the weather was like .
you 'll have to send it as soon as possible .
i understand . the cost of a lot is made up of wood .
maybe i can just send them to my sister 's office .
how much would you like to change ?
my birthday comes next month . i want to hold a birthday party too .
which way is the weather ?
then i came back here . i worked for about three years to get some experience .
i 'm glad you like it . do you come with me ?
yes i do n't think so . you can come very often .
i am ready for what !
it is called the great wall of china . it 's very romantic to go to australia and i d love to visit you .
what did you do about it ?
i like chinese tea very well .
great ! i 'll take you a vacation and we 're leaving on sunday .
yes i 'm probably going to .
oh really ? there 's an interesting combination . a live band the other way to find a place to share it with the rent .
how much do are you looking to spend ?
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
what is your new rick going to be ?
how about i get my license ?
take care of yourself please .
hello steven . what 's new with you ?
no i do n't think you have .
i 'm sorry . but this isn t what i meant .
oh no did he ?
yeah . i know .
and not expensive either .
well slowly but surely it seems that they are n't used to have as many problems as our company went to play .
well i would say that i m just drifting here in the pool .
that s really not too bad . i m glad you ll have to say that again .
well . i was just thinking about going to a movie with my sister and i have no idea what to get .
have you thought about graduate school ?
i graduated from tianjin college of commerce .
never mind . there 's an authentic tasting hot pot restaurant not far from the china world trade towers on chang an street . have you been there ?
you got me .
now listen ben . look i think it s a very good thing that a young man after he s done some very good work should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself and lie around and so on . but after a few weeks i believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his
yes i want to stay in the city .
i like chinese food . i know that 's expensive .
well i think you 're a quick learner .
what 's the weather like in your hometown ?
pretty good sam . only the awful weather you know .
that s right . i ve never really liked it since i got here .
me either but i m dealing with it anyway .
well i ve got some papers due .
really ? so what s the news ?
not too good yet . better than i was though .
i 'm going to the store would you like to go with me ?
he is in the bedroom .
then why do n't we call the day after tomorrow ?
sure but he 's his case .
i see . but this is not a good thing .
it 's thursday i think .
you must know what happened .
this case here you are .
you ca n't do that by now .
i 'm going to work on saturday .
i like almost all . but i like to listen to the music .
and who 's winning ?
i just have n't heard without the word when the home is real .
it 's interesting to see it . what 's it like in your life ?
i 'm so glad you 're so happy .
i ca n't agree with you .
sure . it 's one of the biggest classical music events . have you ever been to the live show ?
i have no idea . but i will bet he will fall asleep more than the first one .
how could we get there ?
that 's for sure . you know i had the greatest time ever .
is there anything less expensive ?
oh speaking of the conductor he is indeed a genius . he did a perfect job . his name is menuhin a descendent of russian american immigrants .
well that 's not as easy as you know .
i hope you will be doing well .
sorry i can t do it .
yes i am . what 's wrong ?
that 's why i was so angry . i must be joking .
he lost his kids college money day trading .
what ? were they having ?
the most popular drinks are listed on the menu of the table . as you can see from the menu there is a special local product of special local product or round the world chicken .
there is a national park in the national park . it s national park and the common building is so popular .
yes . the scenery there is so breathtaking
ok . i can see that .
the board of directors can give you a <unk> on the board of directors . but it has to be a general directive and meet all the friends .
you must have had a great time .
i like it . it s a big problem with the espresso . the water and then sends it into play and hands and walk a lightweight pain .
what is it about this country ?
do you want to go to the top of the street or come here ?
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
i 'm afraid no . all the souvenirs are on sale now .
after a while crocodile .
ok . i 'll bring your food right away .
i 've got a master 's degree and i 'll bring a cloth with you .
the hey how about the tires ? let 's go to the gym as soon as possible .
what 's your favorite air ?
that s right .
can you tell me how to get on the internet ?
it 's a gift from your friend 's office .
do you have the location of the wall ?
the closest garage . what 's the charge ?
what do you want to buy ?
that 's interesting and i like to play soccer games .
not really . i 'm sorry .
i know . and i love all the wood too . and all the things you need is so cute .
i know but you need n't always sell houses .
i know i should . but this is my first time to use the internet .
ok . let 's go to the store and try the best .
now we 'll let you know that we can hold more details .
that s right . the computer is very complicated . it would be very useful for you to use it .
i know . and i 'll buy it .
well i like collecting matchbox ! i 'm not sure if that counts though .
me too . you are a good singer . you can play some golf games for your body to play .
i guess a lot of . . you know i am a good wife and i always read what he will do .
do n't worry . i get the ticket not the stopwatch then . do you want to get some pills ?
i ca n't agree with you .
what do you mean by now ?
maybe you 're right . i will have some time to watch tv or something new . can we get rid of the tv programs by gym ?
it is such a nice place .
sure what would you like to discuss ?
no problem bye .
oh i see . well she must be going to have a sister or a girl .
don t worry about it . but we ll have to get another chance .
yes . i hope it will be good beach here .
yes please . i 'm going to the boarding time .
i worked there for long time . a few years ago i got an attention part in the olympic games .
how did he survive ?
nothing about the olympic games .
ok . what 's the favorite color ?
it looks wonderful . i know we should have a look in the small one but i do n't know .
thank you for your interest .
that 's interesting . shall we show two players ?
what did you say in your family ?
that 's a great idea . everyone has always been there for two years .
he 's going to the <unk> one .
have you noticed what he 's been doing ?
right now he speaks english and he can say a few chinese words . but he will be back in about twentyfive minutes .
ca n't you give me a ring ?
i know that . i was trying to call it now .
really ? it 's so huge .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
i 'm a little worried about my host family . you know in the agreement i have to do some cooking for them .
what 's your program ?
it bears a great many of advantages but also some weak points .
is it ? i 've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
for instance the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .
that 's true . some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
actually it 's not the fault of the mobile phone . but people should have a proper attitude towards it . mobile phone is a tool serving people not the fetters restricting them .
really ? where do you work now ?
i have an appointment right now . i 'm ready for the assistant and i have to go to the hospital .
they 're supposed to come to the apartment . why do n't you ask for some time off ?
yes i believe i . . . i just need to know the pressure and i have to work .
well how about tomorrow night ?
what should i do doctor ?
thanks for coming .
yeah . water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues .
but what are the sources of water pollution ?
they could generally be divided into two categories direct and indirect contaminant sources .
that 's terrible . where are they ?
yeah . they are emitted directly into urban water supplies .
but what about the indirect ones ?
indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater .
i see . for the sake of us all we should be an active participator in the prevention of it .
sure . it 's an issue asking for everyone 's participation .
okay let 's call it a day .
when is it due ?
she might be a pretty serious person . she just likes to do well in a pretty soon .
we 're trying to get out of the windowand fred here .
it is true . ok . i 'll put this up with your hands and experience .
he lost the money .
which is better ?
with the experience i would be able to work in the evenings and at the beginning of each individual .
i see . it s a very important experience .
i feel it 's great and i there are so many opportunities around them . it seems that they are all friendly and easygoing and easygoing .
oh that sounds interesting .
hey this is a good opportunity . i want to buy something for the new year .
i mean you could n't give it up .
that 's true . if i do n't agree with you i 'll try that next time .
that 's what you did to hear . there are thousands of dollars you can get what you want to hear .
i am afraid i can t today . but it is urgent . i think i must be going on a business trip .
the usual practice on saturday morning is nearly always a big one . it must be a lot of fun than you do .
sounds not good . i wo n't take it .
great ! let 's meet in front of the train station .
when did you say ?
how about meeting each other ?
ok . bye !
i do n't know . i am not sure if the weather is hot . i can get a new one .
i see . what does the kitchen like ?
oh i had a car before . it 's very expensive .
i was so glad that the heat is over it .
i 'm sorry . i thought you 'd like to pay for the registration .
well i have to go to the movies so i do n't want to have a look at it .
good afternoon ! sit down please . how are you ?
terrible . are you doing anything this weekend ?
i 'm sorry . i know you are my cigarettes .
are you american ?
yes . i have found it difficult to get a visa buy .
where were you working ?
thank you very much . i 'll get your phone number .
it is a new film transformer .
it was a great game . and it rained all the time .
how did you like the movie ?
i thought it was pretty good .
really ? i ca n't say i agree .
and i hear that maybe you should give the balls this time .
it 's about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .
i guess it could happen .
very well sir . i 'll be a them them them all right ?
is n't there anything else i should do ?
in that case i 've got a lot of homework to do .
yes i have never been there before . i just do n't know how to get a good chance .
oops you are right . i am so sorry .
what 's your idea ?
certainly . come on .
yes sunday sounds fine . what time ?
what do you want to do ?
i d be glad to help .
friday 's fine . i want to reserve it for you .
we could provide you with all of that .
hello steven .
no that 's 4479626 .
can i have my 200 please ?
ok . let me see . oh yes . this one is so nice .
in that case i 'll have to check with you .
no i m sorry . i 'll have to meet you . and i 'll be at the hotel tomorrow evening .
thank you . yes i 'd like to pay some of them .
may i have your name and room number please ?
our telephone number is <unk> .
ok . here is your key .
how about the lyrics ?
do you have any experience in this field ?
and the other company will be very happy .
it certainly is . so we re going to have to return the money .
and which seasons do you like best ?
i think so too . how 's the weather where you are ?
i 'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the conference . i do n't want to get any medicine .
seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? that 's a good idea . let 's go !
hey darling i think i might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . i was so relaxed . it felt as if i were in another world .
come on . it 's a little too strong for you .
i 've got it . i like the sound of stepping on the snow very much .
yes i know . but not very much .
do you smell the sweet scent ?
how big was it ?
no it 's too fast to be true ! he has a moustache but a beard in the long time .
okay . . . a bit later i 'm gonna get it . the ref has made it .
sure . what are they ?
no . i was n't planning to go to australia for graduation . i was just taking my family to play .
that 's too bad . we hate sand storms too . it could be worse than any time .
yes . but the big one with me .
i understand . it was definitely a great game .
we got a couple of friends . enjoy your trip along the city of day we hit to play .
that 's true . for the past two days we could go to the movies . there are plenty of time for the travel .
i d like to .
what is that ? a jellyfish ? it seems that someone could sting you !
i have no idea that the hotel will benefit from us .
neither . the game ended in two all .
but i still think ac milan's defence seems better organized .
but the brazilian is tougher .
well he 's not too bad . i think he 's got the flu .
he 's over sixty .
it is hard to have a lot of energy . they don t have much time to go out and visit the city in the evening .
i guess that s why i wanted to buy some new clothes too . i need to know more about what they want .
it does n't matter i think i 'll take the bad weather . unfortunately this time has been really bad .
i think i 'll just want to live in the swimming pool .
i 'm glad that the weather has been great . let 's go and have a look .
very good idea . the house has a lot of water and warm water .
so it 's true !
well on the contrary i prefer summer ever . it s pretty exciting .
what is your biggest city in is that ?
can i take dictation in english and i need microsoft words and microsoft words .
it s certainly a popular hobby . i know a lot of people love stamps .
you prefer expensive <unk>
i like the most part of the day .
do you have any hobbies like playing chess ?
yes i play it with tony .
oh . it 's a pity that it 's not as fun as it can be fun .
that would be lovely . what would you like to do ?
not much . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .
oh that 's exciting . what 's this guy like ? is he hot ?
well i did n't think so at first . but as we started talking i found his extremely funny and witty . i could n't stop laughing at his jokes ! we have so much in common . we like the same teams music a
well right so the face is really the right straw .
there 's nothing definite i think . i do n't have a list or anything but when i first meet somebody i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have radar h
well that 's something i 've never heard of . but if you as me what i value most in a friend i would have to say honesty .
as a matter of fact that the results are experiencing severe pain or not what is going to be honest .
yeah i know . a friend in need is a friend indeed . i do n't need fairweather friends either .
i like doing aerobics in my spare time . it 's good for my health .
that all depends on the weight .
i like popular music the other dances because it 's very nice .
how about samba ?
there are no doubt about playing chess . one can also be a very aggressive experience .
i do n't like playing those games . i 'm still a real fan of games .
it all is still very popular . you only need to pop up that account the money for the machine . and also it will save you money for her money .
i like all kinds of things . i like to do different things .
that 's nice . and i can imagine the lawn of the park nearby .
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
i think he s really cute . i like him but i was so tired .
oh it 's love at first sight . when will you see each other again ?
he did n't say but he said he would call me .
maybe he is busy with his work . just wait and try not to think about it too much !
oh steve . stop it ! i am a bit nervous ! what if he does n't call ?
come on mary you 're a total catch . i bet he will call you . do n't worry .
thank you steve . you 're always so encouraging .
that 's what friends are for .
thank you ! i 'm so glad you decided to come to this time . it 's a beautiful place .
do you want to help me ?
it 's the most famous girl in my office .
is she our teacher ?
let me tell you the story . in 1892 patty smith hill and mildred hill wrote a song called good morning to you . but later someone added the words happy birthday to their tune .
i 'll try .
what will happen on ?
correct . but i think it is worth it .
i think i 'm not sure . let 's stay in a regular space .
what is just being with you ?
i 've been in the daytime .
do you like it ?
i do n't have any idea what i would wear .
i 'm not sure yet . can you hang out with the movies ?
yeah it is nice but its so many places are not so expensive .
well it is good enough .
great . i think i might like to have a look .
not really . i 'm going to have to hard time off for a while .
oh i see . i think it 's a strange question for me to have a child .
let 's do it . we 're going to really bad luck !
i like it ! it 's so beautiful . i 've never been in a public place and i like the smell .
i 'm afraid i can t . i really do n't think so .
the kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . hide away yijun !
i think it 's made in too big . would you like to have it in a color or the dark ?
do you have an idea of what you re talking about ?
no . i think it 's about time we 've got to stay in the hospital .
yeah i think i 'll get a letter of his house .
i 'm sorry sir . i wo n't bring you any clothes .
ok . good .
yes sir . do you think we have a chinese restaurant in the corner ?
this is a new year i like you .
how did you feel like going to get back ?
my boy called me this morning .
that 's really nice of you .
that 's a good idea . you got to catch the bus .
you do n't have to take it easy .
no i thought i 'd have to come back it .
i 'm sure everything will be perfect .
oh yeah . i know you want to try it . this really is my favorite movie .
i told you to get off when i was in the bank .
it 's about the children who are trying to get married .
that sounds like a huge market . in that case you got to be kidding .
he lost the money .
what did he do ?
no he got the money and tried to call you .
ok . i 'll make the arrangements . it will be great .
i do n't know how to thank you .
yeah it 's a sad thing that he ca n't have it . do n't worry about it .
he 's so young and he 's been living with his parents .
i hope he 'll be all right .
i was just thinking about taking a movie last night and i want to know a movie of fact that they put a terrible tradition in college .
it was gone by the bank .
i 'm sorry . it 's been a sad story .
so what did the cops do ?
are n't they cool ? i like the settings .
he did n't make it a bid on the buddha . it was his first time .
well as we say the rest is history . . .
then he is really lucky .
it gives me a lot of pressure and i feel depressed .

wow ! what a hit !
yeah he tackled him so hard his helmet came off .
is he ok ?
it looks like it he s getting up .
i guess he hit him too hard the <unk> just called a penalty on the home team .
the giants ?
yes . i think a good advertising company is a good advertising company . it 's an easy to do .
by the way my name is liu wei .
what happened ? why did everyone get so quiet ?
the <unk> s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . we re losing again .
yeah i just got them . i started playing ice hockey in a community league . so i finally got myself new skates .

i 'm just watching some television .
i 'm so bored . i do n't know what i 'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning .
me too . do you think we are boring people ?
i do n't think we are boring . it 's just that we do n't have any hobbies .
that 's right . what do you think we should do as a hobby ?
that all depends on what you like to do . for example i like to doodle on the notepad so i 'm thinking about doing some real drawings .
i like to play the piano for fun .

i 've given her enough time . we do n't have any trouble to lose her .
but that 's better than keeping everything to yourself . you 've got to let her know . come on ! you 've got to take a chance ! even though you are rejected it 's not the end of the world ! there 's nothing to lose is there ?
thank you for the wonderful evening .
oh it 's so quiet . i wish i had this a bad day .
i 've been doing my love recently and i 'll have trouble taking up my own .
i agree . it s lovely but i think it s still too hot for the kids to get on the grass .
i know . it 's going to be so much fun . who 's your favorite band ?
i think these are a designed one . but i do n't know what to wear .
do n't worry about that . you can ask her to give you a hand .
i love them too . they are so beautiful . you know it 's a very traditional family .
thanks . i 'll do it in a minute .

you really have no idea about that . you are a good wife .
what do you think of the most expensive one ?
oh it 's a <unk> .
i do n't know . i just feel a little tired .
i 'll have a try .
we 've got a real time .

i 'm free tomorrow i 'll have time to tell you .

it 's very nice to have you with us .
i 'll call you as soon as possible .
i am not sure if i can .
i 'd like to leave with you . thanks for coming .
please let me know if there 's anything else to do .
excuse me miss . can you show me my seat ?
you are welcome ! bye !
sure . have you got anywhere in mind ?
i 'm starving so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .
that italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . do you want to go there ?
i 'm not really in the mood for italian actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy .
if you want spicy food then i 'd recommend going to a thai indian or chinese restaurant . how about that chinese buffet on <unk> road ?
i really like that restaurant you get a lot for your money there . but they 've westernized their food so it 's not actually that spicy .
you 're right . most of their dishes have sweet sauces . we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us .
the taj ? they 're a bit expensive but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
the taj it is then .
shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
they 'll still charge us a corkage fee .
that 's right . it 'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .
do n't worry about money . i 'll treat you tonight .
are you sure ? we could go dutch .
no i 'll pay . it 's my turn anyway . you paid last time .
i wo n't argue with that ! let 's go !

as a matter of fact he is .
do n't believe him . he 's a liar .
we cannot expect politics to be true anyway .
he 's very strict with us .

yeah . but he is going to have to make a clear decision .
they have moved to chicago .
so what about the traffic ?
well . i was just thinking about going to a movie with my sister and i have no idea what to get .
we don t think out of money .
i think you 'll agree with me .
it 's about two hundred dollars .
oh i see . yes i 'll get the money and the dollar account .
but it seems that it 's too late for us to change money . i 'll have to pay the last time .
if we order 1000 cases we can not reduce a much money .
i 'll try that sir . a few people 'll be there with you .
i 'm leaving on sunday . we 're going to travel to europe .
what 's the weather like in your house ?

i hope so . i can choose it tonight .
oh i know a little bit about five o 'clock .
i do n't want to miss it today .
oh it was great . the food was really a great time .
yes it is . but i could n't say the weather was good .
you 'll have to send it as soon as possible .
yes i understand what you mean . the rent for me is made up of pure silk .
i like the top of the stairs and the air . it was a real problem .
how much is the fare ?
then i came back to the car park and had to walk the bathroom . when i was a kid i forgot to wait for the next bus .
great ! you are a good student . what do you think are the kids ?
yes i do n't think so . you can come very often .
me too . recently i 've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them .
do n't you know the <unk> ?
i 'm afraid not . to me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
of course ! i m very sorry .
it 's nice . let s take a look .
that 's why it is so romantic ! the race is not as good as the one i can see it 's hard to imagine .
when did you start worrying about your weight ?
crazy !
how about your summer ?
i admit i 'm a lot of <unk> .
how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look ? i remember there is one in the gym .
that 's a good idea . i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
me too . what did you have in mind ?
i have n't decided yet but i think the olympic mascots are a must .
i agree . they 're very lovely especially huan huan .
i think you 'll like the pink one too .
the five dolls are sold together as a set and they 're priced according to the size . the bigger they are the more expensive .
oh i see . if i buy more than a set can i get any discount ?
i do n't think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now .
any other ideas ?
there are lots of things such as postcards key chains posters and various arts and crafts .
it all sounds great . we can go there after the match . i ca n't wait to see what they have .
i will be leaving on it soon .
great ! stay here .
no it s not as hot as in beijing .
that s right . i heard there are a lot of people from america and far from here .
history where ?
actually not that 's quite a good place . i have to get there late .
20 per day .
i like them too . i think the hero were not good for them but i really enjoy watching them without star wars .
you see . but your grades are not good enough to do .
no that 's right . i 'll call you now .
i think you 're right i really like it . is it the traditional chinese one ?
how can you tell me ? i like movies because i do n't like them .
no i have n't . when do you go to beijing ?
oh . how do you like it ?
yes . the train i can add them to the jess s birthday set .
well i think you must have been going to a new year . i 've been happy to this time .
yes i have been travelling abroad and i m sure you will like it .
yes . i ve been waiting in line with you several weeks . how is everything at the department ?
how often do you play tennis ?
it was great . the director took a lot of care while <unk> . they say be has good chance at winning the oscar for best director . also i like the actors some really great new young actors .
yes . i m now at home . i ve got some music and i m afraid we ve got something old . it s a nice evening .
at the moment you can t afford that . if you re going to lose the price you just choose our company s car .
how far is it ?
i got some business documents .
where are you going ?
i don t know why i am .
well it was anything you d better to call me home .
i m on my way to get him .
i am not sure what you were going to have to buy .
would you like to say something about this one ? it s the latest fashion .
does he need any help ?
yeah i am . i understand .
congratulations . and i hope you feel better now .
no i was hoping to meet you at least 10 o 'clock .
i can t bear to look at this .
do you feel tired ?
do you know what the weather is going to be like tomorrow ?
that s normal . what kind of job do you have for ?
yeah but i still have to go back to the gym to go shopping .
joe ? i do n't know what you mean .
i remember you are in love .
oh i took a shine to him when we met for the first time . but it comes and goes .
it 's greek to me .
so the reform can not be carried out well .
the government is making efforts to change situation .
yeah .
he is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
what ? it s only 9 p . m . now . why today he went to bed so early ?
he ran four miles and came back dead beat .
that s right . he was walking . and running for a long time .
i 'm tired of your cutanddried opinions . who do you think you are !
how dare you speak to me like this .
sorry i can t think of that .
i 'll make sure i can .
i knew this would happen some day . . .
you are so thoughtful .
what time shall we start ?
it must be dreadful to grow old .
it sure is . he has no one to turn to very miserable indeed .
have n't you heard that he is in prison ?
what ? beg your pardon .
john is in prison now . he was copped outstealing .
i just can n't believe my ears !
i ca n't deny that . she is so beautiful that i fell in love with her at the first sight . i wish i knew more about her .
but i heard that she had a threeyearold girl .
i can not belive that . it must be cooked up by someone .
of course i wo n't chill out . opportunity knocks only once .
you should strike while the iron is hot .
you 're right . i will have a talk to her about that .
really ? i thought he loved his wife very much .
yeah . but his wife found out he was pretty upset about her .
he deserved it .
sorry i can t .
tomorrow night then ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
that 's sounds great .
well i have a guest pass . why don t you come with me tonight ?
no . i d better not .
but i am not going to be able to give you a call .
video tape breaks down after fifteen years . so if he collects a lot of tapes after fifteen years they will all start to rot .
yes of course . this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
i m glad you re enjoying it .
thank you for the invitation .
it s my pleasure . would you like another glass of champagne ?
yes please . thank you for everything .
oh thank you so much .

i have to work to run to the grocery store .
mr . smith called just now that he would be with you in a meeting tomorrow and i will be back at the chinatown .
not really . i like it very much .
so i do n't want to hear about it .
i d like to very much .
try to keep cool . it 's not an easy take .
i know . i always hope for the best and prepare for the worst .
then you will be in line for a doom .
terrible . are you doing anything this weekend ?
everything is fine .
i think you are a horrible singer . you should have some kind of aerobic sports for example .
it 's true . and what did you watch yesterday ? it 's real chinese food .
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
say it ! we should be an important meeting and learn the things .
yes it is quite the right time . but under the circumstances i think i ll have a heart of how do you spell the potential ones ?
how could i know ? i had been dating for 20 years and i didn t get married yet .
yes . but not for many weeks . it 's just the same time now .
married ? i still ca n't believe it .
i 'm afraid it 's too hard to wash off the stain .
yes it 's true . but it 's a traditional traditional marriage .
also the guest <unk> is becoming more and more popular .
do they get married ?
how did you like your cuticles cut too ?
so am i .
how awful poor guy .
he s a huge guy . i guess most of the world stars . com have no idea what he will be .
i know i have a bad cough but i just will feel energetic and it is not nice .
what ! these flowers do not like ?
where are you from ?
oh my god . i have a few clients so i need to take another look .
very well thank you . isn t it a lovely day ?
that 's interesting . i was thinking of getting a bit cheaper .

eight o 'clock would be fine .
ok . i 'll see you then .

oh my poor danny sure you are a man . but you know running like this in street is very dangerous .
how about a rest ?
oh i 'm sorry . but i 'm not a bad guy .
he must have been really interesting .
oh i am sorry for that . what 's your favorite coffee ?
i mean you can give it a gift or something .
she bought it on sale of the market .
i wonder why you go to bed and have a good rest .
come on . i think i ll envy you .
oh my god ! and i m just gonna get a new home . what do i need to do ?
ok . i 'll go find a pair of glasses .
he must be pretty disappointed .
i heard that you got a five hundred bucks of a dozen of 75 dollars .
well . i was just thinking about going to a movie with my sister and i have no idea what to get .
you could try but i ca n't help you find a place that has been the right .
i m sorry i shall .
no they are n't . i guess they are n't !
oh that s too bad . but this is my first time to talk with .
yeah i like being a lot of homework . they chose the same computers and learn how to entertain themselves .
i mean you could n't give it up .
but i can t stand it .
would you like me to go with you ?
i 'd like to but i 'm tied up with my paper .

i did n't really like it .
mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
i found it very disappointing .
she liked the acting too because that 's what she wanted to see .
i was n't happy with it .
nothing is to your satisfaction .

he s nearly 90 .
good gracious ! are you sure ?
i am . what s more his wife is 84 .
does that include the service charge ?
yes she is . and guess what he is her sixth husband .

yes he 's really a good excuse to me . but i always get up late on him .
yes he ca n't .
no i assure you .
and you 'll repair the television wo n't you ?
yes but i 'm going to clean it .

i 'll enjoy working with you . thanks for asking me .

you 're right . i love it very much .
it must be old .
at least more than 100 years old .
let 's enter it !
i ca n't open the door .
it must be locked .
let me ask the old woman in that reception office .
she ca n't answer you .
she must be deaf .
it must be a haunted house . are you frightened ?
frightened ? you must be joking .
yes i am studying english for my chemistry exam .
but i m afraid it will be a little delayed .
how do you do ms . smith ?
by melting it down and then <unk> it . our main products are bin liners for kitchen <unk> and carrier bags for supermarkets .
thank you . have a nice day .
wine please .
thank you mr . jackson .
how about some flowers ?
we also get to the desk from the window and drop off our office . i know you are all going to be great here .
that 's great . i m glad that you decided to do a good job .
hello jack . it 's mary . what are you doing in your office ?
i m working . it s hard to meet some people . i often work late on thursdays .
where s that ?
tomorrow ? no i 'm afraid i would n't be able to . i 'm going out of the town on business .
i m afraid not sir . you re going to have to cut up with your worse weather . our labor unions are going to give the dog down the road .
sorry i never go out on saturday evening . i always watch football on saturday evening .
will you come round next tuesday ?
next tuesday ? just a moment ! it will be the 21st of may . oh dear . arm . . . i promised my aunt i would be at her birthday party .
very good you got a offers .
let me see . yes mary . let 's make it next wednesday .
i m afraid afraid i won t .
no wait you will be too cold without mittens .
i 'm very sorry mr . richard . i 'm not a dancer .
thank you . i feel terrible .
ok i 'll take it . it 's a little dry .
thank you . i always appreciate your help .
definitely i d like to but i am afraid it would be too expensive for me to exchange some things .
i went to yale university .
did you ? and what did you study ?
i have a b . a . in economics .
would you mind telling me how old you are ?
i 'm twentyseven .
and could you tell me what other jobs you have had ?
yes i have worked in a bank for the last five years .
and what was your salary at the bank ?
i got a bank account with a bank statement .
thank you . good evening mr . dean .
would you tell us your name please ?
i 'm helen baker .
glad to meet you ms . baker .
glad to meet you too .
where are you from ms . baker ?
i 'm from new zealand .
what do you do for a living ?
i m a sales manager in a publishing company .
what do you teach ?
what s the problem ?
there is a football match .
let 's call my boss and ask her to help her with that .
yes . it will be better on saturday night .
will that 'll be the sixth of september .
great . i m going to have a rest with you .
thank you . can i cancel my reservation ?
may i see your library card ?
tomorrow ? no i 'm not in the mood for it .
sure . i ll come to your office at ten o clock .
tomorrow night would be good for me .
i was waiting for a call this afternoon and i ran it for a couple of days .
no i have n't but i 've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper .
right . we could go to the interview a band this weekend and make more interesting .
i need to find a decent salary .
you have n't had any experience in either of those fields .
i know . but i 'd like to try . look here are some advertisements that i 've cut out .
i was turned down again . it s frustrating . i guess you ve got to teach me some skills .
me ? i m even less experienced than you are .
at least you know what american women generally like in a man .
believe it or not i guess american women like a man in good shape which chinese women may not care about so much . that s my honest opinion . i know you have been trying very hard .
american men are naturally taller than chinese men . so even if i exercise there aren t many chances .
no that s not true . i ve met two american women who were married to chinese . but those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is jacky chan ? he can have any american woman he wants .
you know that s going to be a tremendous change for me . because i never exercise .
why don t you try then ? even if it doesn t help you find an american girl you could still have a stronger and healthier body . you won t lose anything by doing that .
hi don . what a surprise !
yeah i saw someone walking like you but i wasn t sure . we haven t seen each other for how long ? almost three months ? but you look quite different now .
have you noticed what has changed ?
oh you look quite slender and more <unk> . what have you been taking ? are you on a diet ?
yes . i m on a diet but i ve not taken anything . i just eat less and exercise more . and it really worked in the past three months . i ve lost twelve pounds .
wow ! that s great . i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals but it s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . also you know old habits are hard to break .
what kind of exercise do you think i do ? i just go to dance everyday after work . i m taking an amateur dance class . i dance two hours everyday .
dance ? you only go dancing ? that s not hard . i can do that .
sure . join my class next week .
wow ! but i do n't think you 'll be angry !
hey i 've got a great time .
i am sorry now . in any case let s first make some careful investigations .
and i got mine from ikea .
ok let 's go there to the brain winds . this is one of the main reason .
ok . i 'll see you tomorrow then .
are you serious ? i have n't had a job and i am looking for a job as a top assistant .
i just want to throw the dishes in the water .
yes . if i have a college teacher i will be a successful job performance in seattle .
i ca n't believe it .
yeah . it 's all my dream to say was getting worse . i 've been learning every year .
no it 's not easy .
as a wise decision we have a basic letter of credit reading you . what is your current account ?
like what ? i think we would like to be isolating our children from social interaction .
is it the final decision of the job ?
i 'm very sorry sir . i 've just lost my job .
i understand your story . i do n't think we 're having a good time to work together .
really ? is it tiring ?
absolutely . i do n't think any planes are going to have any part of the country . i do n't want to anything but has been going anywhere .
yeah . i know it 's not just a joke .
well why don t you tell me a lot about it ?
what ? i ca n't believe it .
that 's all right . everyone wants to read the directly from the government and arrange the meeting the boss to fix it .
based on what you mean ! the big issue has been so many problems and has ruined by the population .
no thanks i m just looking forward to this year .
that 's right . the meeting is coming . please come back for a moment .
i see ! wait a minute . . . what is your halloween spirit ?
well you know it 's a time to get together with all your family and be thankful for everything !
it is a big picnic right ? i went to the park with my parents and i was a little bit nervous .
this is a great opportunity . i hate a woke design and a side of the delicate sea !
i 'm not sure . i 'll get it up on my mind .
oh ok . here are all the receipts .
that s right . but keep on eating and safe . i ll call them later .
well i do n't want a pair of chocolate cakes .
no but we have n't had any idea of that before .
that 's the impression i was in the third of my friend and i played manakin skywalker . i ca n't find it .
i do n't have any money to go out with my friend . i have a lot of things to eat .
what 's your wife ?
no not really . why do you like them ?
i know . i am still getting starting to move out .
that s nice . we ll keep you in mind . what s the matter ?
i 'm afraid that i 'm very ill . i 'm just worried about my work .
what are you going to be fine with the water ?
i m afraid i can t do that .
i would like to 25 off .
can i have a look at your passport ?
don t worry about it . there s this dress . it s made of pure gold necklace .
i know . i promise my best way .
i m sorry mr . richard .
thank you very much . i have a lot of mistakes .
okay . i ll pick you up around 6
very good . i will be there .
not a problem . it was a great pleasure to have you with us .
what s your secret ? do you want to have a proper job or something ?
that 's all i 'm so touched .
i mean you could n't give it up .
i 'm sure you do n't write enough . for your exam you do you have a good time in the library ?
all right . i 'll just pay it for you . please fill in the form and sent it to you .
oh yeah . it 's really nice .
it 's called endless love . it 's a place to buy some really big city in the city .
it 's true . i 'm not really sure whether <unk> is popular or not .
and the dog is over there with people from dinner that guy is over there . he s really going to have to be so much fun .
wow i must have thought about it . i guess the other day they are going to get lost .
well it 's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . so unfortunately you 'll lose this 50 rib . we 'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .
ah ! i see . so what 's wrong with the gay marriage ?
it s still a natural stone .
it 's not bad . then maybe you will feel a little stupid .
let 's call it a deal . hope to see you again soon . keep in touch then we will have a good day .
he lost the money .
thank you for saying that . what are the date of having ?
yeah i 'll be right back !
what are you talking about ? we have been having so much fun on christmas day .
i 'd guess that 's what i think .
i just start counting more time .
well in that case i guess the problem is that i can be more understanding . you should n't have a problem finding another girlfriend or you can ask for him to go to the beach anytime you want .
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
hi how do you do ?
thank you . here 's a present for you .
that s very specialized . thanks . how much did you get them ?
you know what ? i don t think i like those things . oh here s a list of other things . what did you say ?
i m very sorry sir .
you re not going to get it ! i m gonna get a new one !
it was interesting but i had my passport with me at least one . i am sure i can get used to it .
really ? nothing is driving a house here .
did you know that ? we always have to cut off the grass and there s lots of drunk in the city .
it 's about 200 years old .
yes . but it s not as good as it s well done .
they are so good !
that is terrible . but what is it ?
yes . it s a small room .
have you ever heard about it ?
thanks . it s a lot better than i expected . we ll be able to get some highlights on the team early saturday .
the time of next week .
what did you get ? i have a look at your budget .
when will you be able to give me a raise ?
it could be interesting .
of course otherwise you ll just have to wait for hours .
i think in some way it is an act of god but in another way it just is caused by us .
what are your parents going to do ?
for example some countries restrict imports by <unk> restriction .
oh i see . fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things .
really ? that 's a straws in the wind .
i think so . maybe he 's fallen for her .
yeah . they suit each other . a perfect match between a man and a girl .
how much is it ?
oh you ve been such a <unk> . . .
well you might have to . . .
i 'll not meet you at the airport again .
but how about cooking chinese food ? can you tell me which one you want to try it ?
you 're right . i 'll try it .
yeah i 'm always coming .
what are you going to do ?
i apologize . i was n't hungry .
no i think we 'll go out and buy the chinese food .
well that 'll be just fine .
i like indian and chinese food . they are very different .
is he a after you 've noticed he makes a lot of money ?
i know . but that does n't work for me . i like chinese food .
of course . is there a big one ?
that 's fate .
i feel sorry for her .
maybe this is god 's will .
we have two cleaning ladies . but both of them have received little education .
most cleaning ladies are illiterate . but some of them do a very nice job .
but i actually dislike another lady . she is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . but the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . she would tell you what to do and where to put things .
well i am a little bit out of shape . i think i should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ?
i know . but it 's difficult to keep up the good exercise . it does n't help you lose any weight .
according to the newspaper the situation i was just wondering if we could give them a raise .
we provide free medical insurance and medical insurance .
i 've learned that .
well we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . the trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the workout plan .
great ! but then i 'm getting a little confused about the other alternatives .
they may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you ?
that 's pretty good of you . how much do you charge for my tuition ?
you can get what you want . it 's different for one year and it 's only ten minutes walk .
perhaps one month . i 'll just have a try at first .
definitely . i m afraid it will be a heavy smoker .
yes i like playing the piano .
oh that s interesting and but what kind of things ?
several things for example various coins stamps stones and so on .
stones ? i know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?
yes stones .
well i can t just image it .
i 'm doing great ! how is your food ?
a father of two boys who play basketball match his motorcycle .
so you 're from south america ?
well there 's a long time . you have to stay in bed and if you do n't have enough room .
i know . but i still have to get a lot of money .
it 's a piece of cake and there is a general name of people named hong kong .
so have you been on the bus very long ?
just fine .
but do n't forget her mom .
boy you 've got such a crush on her have n't you ?
i know . it 's a dangerous place for the picnic .
honey i wish you good luck .
my absolutely favorite kind of basketball . it 's hard to say .
yes it stops snowing but i ca n't wait until it 's so cold .
what ? i thought you liked patricia .
what s the matter with you ?
do n't worry about it . just a common cold .
in spring .
romantic ? i will stay there for three days now .
oh yes . it 's nice and bright .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .

you 're such a wimp ! you 're afraid of an eyelash curler .
can you make it ?
all right . and what about the sports channel ?
yes it is . it 's called the festival one of the asian art and the moon bar is very different .
oh yes . i reviewed your resume . but it seems like the project blueprint you sent with the estimate is not quite what you had in mind .
i am giving them a couple of months ago . let 's go to the gym and have our lunch together .
sure . but you know that i ca n't read any chinese characters . what do they say ?
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
it 's interesting and i want to buy one home .
yes it deserves its name .
yes it is very popular . it deserves its name .
sure . how about this one ? it 's not a good feels today . i 'm going to take a look if you want a picture .
right . i 'll show you how . such as the way of the newspaper are not far away from the airport .
it 's interesting and i like chinese tea very much . it 's interesting and i really like chinese tea .
how do you travel ?
right now there are several tourist programs in the city centre but i 'm not sure how long i should take .
no a reasonable university has n't been told me about that .
ok . i will look at the internet that is on the internet .
do you have any other questions about our company ?
hmm . . . if we have any money we would go to the supermarket right ?
is there anything else you 'll get ?
no i hear it 's a good game . what would you like to do ?
fantastic . thanks !
good idea . i want to see what the advantages of getting on the internet .

the food there is actually pretty good .
well i think it 's very important to see you . how many did you study ?
the food there is actually pretty good on the panda express .
ok i will not let you go .
it must be very convenient and pretty quick .
i like to think about it .
i ca n't see it .
you like the food there ?
but maybe i can find my favorite job .
you like the food there ?
yes i know . i like america very much . it is one of my favorites .
a little bit too . that s a little unusual for kids .
no i do n't think so . i really like painting .
yes you can find this way to get a lot of different kinds of food from here .
how about the lyrics ?
ok . it 's amazing how much money to save and i can make a left when you have your resume .
have you read your newspaper ahead in the world ?
for the football match is over there . you can keep your face from getting your feet .
but it 's quite expensive .
i also want to know about the details of online .
well how can i get them ?
video tape breaks down after fifteen years . so if he collects a lot of tapes after fifteen years they will all start to rot .
i know what you mean . i could n't agree with you .
yes . i can give it a lot of information on the internet . it is especially expensive .
can i have my 200 please ?
is there a great place to visit the people there ?
it 's a good choice to have a rough time together .
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
i think i 'm absolutely right now it 's a really bad movie .
yeah . i love variety of movies .
yeah . it seems like we do n't have any money to eat .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
the notebook is this type of movie .
so what 's the gate ?
are you kidding ? i will just have time for you .
bill and betty have already grown up .
oh it 's time to pull a big road .
look at that big tree over there .
yeah oh my god ! it s still there . we have our first date right on there .
is that right ? oh are you going to the new year or your father coming to the wedding ?
but i still get that sometimes .
but you should n't be scared .
smile i can t believe this for it s been 20 years since we got married .
that 's fine . i 'll put it on the sixth of tomorrow .
yes it is . but we get it fixed yesterday . so what 's the score ?
oh there 's a long way to go . how about the movie ?
i am glad you like it .
well the cigarettes and the champagne are excellent in the factory . this is my first time to fill the vacancy in the company and the company is <unk> .
what other kind of food do you like ?
yeah . you know what the program is today and the towards the festival is great . there are many great clubs you know .
no problem . but can we make it a lot of money ?
good idea . some of the trouble you 'd better work .
the double room over the last round ! on the second floor is a super match . the bigger one with only super bowl for this model is about what you are in front of its team .
sure . what 's the reason you want to be there ?
my parents didn t like to go to the movies .
titanic is playing the tennis team . it 's a total of aerobics team this year .
14 hours . so you ca n't get to the airport at that time .
it sounds good . let 's go to one right now .
but he s not a fine wether friend who could sell you down the river .
what is her brother ?
no i do n't think that she has a number of eyes .
it 's martin <unk> . you liked his film the departed did n't you ?
listen let me play a good game .
you 're right . he is also the terminator a lot of charity than you 've seen him .
absolutely ! that s the only thing i can do .
on the contrary i think it 's very romantic .
there s so much i want to do . i ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . i just ran a search for music to download .
i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
thanks . that would be very helpful . i ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . there s too much information on the net .
when you sent your emails did you attach any files to them ?
yes i did . there s an antivirus programme with my email account that <unk> all attachments so i m sure i haven t sent anything nasty to anyone .
when you use the internet be careful not to give out your email address very often . if you do you might get a lot of <unk> email form companies trying to sell you things .
that s good advice . i should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself such as my password and credit car number .
that s right . another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time
how do i do that ?
take this web page for example . press the keys control and d together . click on favourites at the top of the screen . there you are . it has been added to you favourites list . if you click it you will
that s useful to know . thanks . i ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .
really ? i m not sure that i would like all the attention . there have been numerous cases of paparazzi <unk> with star s private live in recent years .
i love being <unk> ! if i were famous i d do interviews for all the top magazines like cosmo and elle .
i wouldn t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice but it would get tedious after a while . imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you .
noone really believes gossip columnists .
i think you ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . you d also have to be very careful about every word you said . if you <unk> on a chat show and said something silly it
i think you re right about that . i d need a good manager to be my <unk> . i could do a lot of charity work which would help a lot of people .
that s a great idea . which charities would you support ?
i love children as you know so probably a children s charity .
you d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity so you d really need to be very careful . anyway i d be the first to buy your posters and i d attend your first book
thanks for your help .
yes it is . thanks . i m just surfing on the internet .
here ? in this cafe ? how can you do that ?
this cafe offers a wireless internet connection . that means i can get on the net for free while i m here . of course i have to buy a cup of coffee !
that s great . can you do it anywhere ?
no . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . there are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
so what programs do you have on your laptop ?
i ve got a few pictures of all the usual ones for my children .
i know you are keen on photography . it s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone anywhere at a
it s wonderful isn t it ? would you like to see some photos that i took recently ?
yes i do . i also use an antispyware program and a firewall . there are so many <unk> on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . you have to be very c
how often do you run your antivirus program ?
i usually run it every few days . it finds a virus about half the time . it finds a virus about half the time .
which antivirus program would you recommend ?
have you tried this one ? it s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . you can also download updates for free .
that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ?
just a minute . . . . a few minutes ago to download the internet from here . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the internet too . it only takes a few minutes to download .
what do you use your computer for ?
i use it for several thingssurfing the net word processing and creating presentations . i don t play many games on my computer but i do a lot of work with photographs . using a computer program you
computers are great aren t they ? i should download some programs and learn how to use them .
i use it almost every day but i usually only use it to check my email . i don t often surf the net . you use the internet a lot don t you ?
yes . i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . it can be frustrating when the connection is poor .
so you re online eight hours a day .
yes i like the job though . sometimes i help other people in the office if they re having trouble online .
how useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?
i think it s fairly useful but there are two big problems . first a lot of the information you find online is false . second when you buy something online you don t see it until you actually get it .
how do you solve the website problems when you re buying something online ?
what i do is find the website of shops . then someone from our company <unk> the shop and buys when they re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .
i d say the main reason is poverty . countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . if their neighbors have some resources they try to steal them by military force .
it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end .
how do you think they could be ended ?
i 'm afraid my father did n't agree with you .
so if the cause is poverty there should be a programme to make the country richer . if the problem is resources share them .
it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality it 's harder to make peace between countries .
yes . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .
the problem is that many poor people might suffer .
would you like to live in the country ? i m not sure i d like it .
i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that for me each advantage has its own disadvantage .
that 's interesting . so i have to figure out what i m looking for .
i mean you could n't give it up .
what s the reason ?
people can t have it both ways . if you live in the country it is often less convenient . if you live in a city it is noisy buy there s more to do .
i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they re so much better to look at than concrete rows of parked cars and tall buildings .
i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . when the wind blows in the city you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .
the view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . there s so sign of pollution . the village looks so peaceful .
just remember that in that village there s nothing to do . there s not even a pub or restaurant . there s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .
you re right . i would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . i would hate living in the country !
of course not . i 'll tell you about it .
i m not sure if i m going to meet with you .
i m sorry . this isn t our first time to china .
i do n't think you 'll find out if there were a lot of people . it 's just that the world 's worth watching .
perhaps you ve heard about a person .
that s right . then i will definitely go there someday .
for example some countries restrict imports by <unk> restriction .
and the other guys have to take care of that .
why not ! it s a classic in fact it s one of my favorite novels .
but it s so old . you ve got a character part of the movie .
don t judge a book by its cover . do you kwon what it s about ?
no not at all .
are you planning on studying abroad ?
i didn t realize it was a romance novel . what s the main storyline ?
it s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .
why does he want to do that ?
since he doesn t have a son he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . that way all of his daughters will be cared for .
won t they get his inheritance ?
no that s the problem . though they are welloff once he dies his house will go to his cousin . so when he dies the girls will have nothing .
i see . this sounds interesting ! maybe my teacher isn t so horrible after all .
so are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
there s movie ? my teacher didn t tell me that !
that s probably because she wants you to read the book first .
it would take a lot less time . .
how about this . when you finish the book . i ll get the movie and watch it with you .
ok . that sounds like a deal .
i only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . i don t think that tv is bad for kids . i think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes .
perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first .
if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch remember to have something else for them to do . if you don t they ll get bored and misbehave .
they could go out and play with their friends .
sure . you could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time .
perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . he watches too much tv too .
that s a good idea . remember that if the parents watch too much tv the kids will probably follow suit .
i like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . but i don t like traveling to work waiting for buses or . . .
or getting stuck in traffic jams when you re driving .
i think something must be done .
it 's gone with the wind .
why do you like it best ?
i enjoy the various characters and the plot .
well . i like the thorn birds best .
do you have a family tree in the town ?
sure . i get a lot of information and make many friends .
if i have a chance i 'll enjoy the book .
would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
that 's a good idea . let 's go !
it 's the best seller everyone 's been talking about for the last six months .
how in the world did you get a copy ? i 've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i 'm still waiting my turn .
i checked it out of the rental library . it only costs five cents a day .
is it really worth paying for ?
i ca n't tell yet . i have n't got beyond the first chapter .
if it 's any good i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
not a great deal .
i 've just been reading an article about them . they ll be used for all sorts of things now .
for accounting system and things like that you mean ?
yes but they are used for other things too . do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to paris .
great ! i shall go to the movie theater instead . we can get a movie .
it 's true sir .
of course his machine must have been connected to a computer .
yes he was .
oh this is my hair . but it seems that i have to leave .
yeah . i think that you are a good boy . what did you think about your family ?
i mean you could n't give it up .
but i can always pay for it .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
oh what s he like ?
he s got dark hair and brown eyes .
where ? dark ?
can i have my 200 please ?
um that s good .
yes but he s got a wife and 3 children as well .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .
what happened ? you look so pale .
it 's the end of the world for me .
and what do you think would be the right person ?
well i just need to make and receive calls and it 's quite reliable . i find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong you know ? i mean this camera function for instancehow often do you use it ?
oh that 's too bad . work harder next term .
b i 'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me .
do n't lose heart . everything will be fine .
all right . i would like to see you in advance that case . one more thing i can get you to bed in two days .
yes of course . this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
i m glad you re enjoying it .
thank you for the invitation .
it s my pleasure . would you like another glass of champagne ?
yes please . thank you for everything .
sorry i can t .
tomorrow night then ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
that s sounds great .
ok . how about give me a ring then ?
no . i d better not .
but i am not going to be able to give you a call .
video tape breaks down after fifteen years . so if he collects a lot of tapes after fifteen years they will all start to rot .
i m looking at my horoscope for this month ! my outlook is very positive . it says that i should take a vacation to someplace exotic and that i will have a passionate summer fling !
what are you talking about ? let me see that . . . what are <unk> ?
it s a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign . you have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . i was born on april 15th so i m an aries . when were you born ?
january 5th .
let s see . . . you re a capricorn . it says that you will be feeling stress at work but you could see new exciting developments in your love life . looks like we ll both have interesting summers !
that s bogus . i do n't feel any stress at work and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
no it s not your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . see ? it says that an aries is energetic and loves to socialize .
well you certainly match those criteria but they re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ?
a capricorn is <unk> and practical . she likes to do things in conventional ways . that sounds just like you !
ok ! how about <unk> ?
no no no a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . i m going to describe someone s face and you guess who it is !
me too . i have to go somewhere where my friends are buried with me and meet me at the same time .
and no hijackers .
our cousin pete ! my turn ! she has a <unk> nose <unk> eyes and a mole on her chin !
aunt rose ! that mole is so huge ! ok my turn . he has a crooked nose and full lips . he has quite a few freckles and an oval face . oh he is also bald !
your future husband !
not funny .
putting on mascara .
mumm . no .
it s only the day when the world s biggest sporting event is kicking off .
it s bigger than the super bowl of this world ! the speed limit is bigger and more than the world from 32 countries .
the y . h . a . mun . the youth hostel 's association .
i have no idea what you re talking about . the only sporting event we watch at home is the super bowl .
this is bigger than the super bowl man ! teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . they first start in a group stage with bigger groups each g
sounds interesting but soccer doesn t really appeal to me . i 'll be right there and appeal to the physical team .
are you kidding ? over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup ! it s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! each nation is cheering on their team hoping they will bec
what is that ?
whatever i m going to go watch the opening match .
mine was ok except that no one in my class speaks english . i guess it will force me to <unk> in chinese more in class so at least i should improve a lot this semester .
that s both fortunate and unfortunate . it s the united nations in my class ! we have people from all over the world ! there are three germans a pole a scottish two french an american a brazilian
that s quite the array of nationalities . everyone in my class is from asia except me . there are a few south koreans several japanese malaysian thai singaporean filipino kazakhstan and o
well i think you re pretty lucky actually . i think you ll have the opportunity to learn so much about asian culture .
i guess so but i think it s going to be hard to relate to my classmates especially with the language barrier . i think i might change classes .
don t ! stay the course ! your spoken chinese will be eternally grateful . i bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice .
i highly doubt it . your girlfriend is chinese .
well there is that yes .
it does seem like the perfect day ! i m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! ok kids put on your sunscreen while the mom and i set up the beach and i set up the sunscreen while your mom and i set up the walls .
there we re a package tour . can you help me with the umbrella ? perfect .
ok kids here <unk> beach ball and a frisbee a pail and a shovel . i want to see an impressive <unk> by the time we leave . don t stray too far . wait ! leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes
and stay in the shallow area . i don t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! it s too deep out there and we didn t bring your floatier .
you re back already ? the water was too cold huh ? i ll tell you a secret . do you see that small pool of water over there ? it ll be warmer in there . go see if you can find some seashells or catch some
what is that ? a jellyfish ? jeremy put that down right now ! it could sting you !
ah ! not on me ! ow !
i want to think of it for some time .
i hope that we do not have a girlfriend or something .
what are you talking about ? we have a great time here . do you think we can go with that ?
that s fine ! i went there and see you after your christmas . thank you for your time !
she is a teacher of aerobics .
it ll be a good idea to me ! i m going to go home and make more money .
no one thousand at least .
hmm . . . that 's a big family in my country . is there anything going to be in the cinema ?
your throat is inflamed . and your tongue is heavily coated . you have all the symptoms of influenza .
thank you for your love and i think we ll make a big presentation .
oh while we 're on the subject what happened to you and your secretary ?
well it s beautiful . we re going to have a great time .

i m terribly sorry . i ll get it . i ll put you down in the mail box .
it was always very busy there .
well i m looking forward to doing something like that . it s no problem .
how about you ? i don t think you re having to buy all of my films on sale today .
if you can t get a pet . you can always have another one .
i never knew you had a question . do you have the guts to get a try ?
oh come on ! you know he s really hot .
fine ! if that was a big deal i d say we ll get a better picture of the garden .
thanks ! i like your brother and brother . she told me that she wanted to be able to get her something to drink .
it 's the same with each one that i also have been in china for quite a long time . i remember how much you paid for . it 's like i can have one copy of the most important storybooks day with them .
i m sure you re right . but you should never end up walking because i m on a business trip .
it is no problem . it does n't be helped . i hate being so ridiculous .
yeah but i don t know what to tell you .
ok i think so . only time to make it work hard . we have to meet again .
thanks for the info . i hope you re right .
kathy ! here betty !
he lost the money .
ben we are fifteen . what kind of job are you looking for ?
oh just for a position as a gas station attendant . you know starting at a simple lowly job just like all the greats before they made it big in the world .
uhhuh .
but i m just in it for the money right ? how else am i going to be able to afford to keep taking angela to the movies ? besides i love the smell of gasoline don t you ?
yeah ? you finally decided to wipe the slate clean ?
you got it ! i have a new job i m living in a new city with new friends ! this is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way i live my life .
so what are you going to do ? take up an art class or something ?
well first of all i ve decided to stop smoking . it s not that i m pinching pennies or anything it s just that i ve been smoking since i was sixteen and i think it s time to stop .
i m with you on that one . anything else you re planning on doing ?
one last thing i ve decided to come out of the closet .
it s about time !
alright . i m finally coming through my computer . . .
i am not going to be serious ! i have to demonstrate what i am going to know myself .
don t worry about it . i know you ll be having a brother and he s going to get it .
i m looking forward to seeing the history of ancient buildings . we ll be not really here .
wow ! look at my sign . they re so big !
well i guess i just have to give her some tips . you re right . i just can t wait to give her up for one more time .
would you like to go out with me ?
i am sorry but that s what i ve done . we ve lost it . and you know how i am about getting a friend in a month ?
that 's my pleasure . do you have a wine or a cup of coffee ?
would you like cream or sugar in your coffee ?
i 'm going to <unk> the lawn .
i think the red wine will be fine .
and would you like to eat any more ?
well . i was just thinking about going to a movie with my sister and i have no idea what to get .
i 'm not sure what about you ?
this ca n't be the right stop .
my parents are taking it to dinner with me .
how about going for a cup of coffee ?
yes it 's been a long time has n't it ?
it 's easy to say but i will tell you that .
yes mr . emory . how are you ?
thank you ! i 'll have to bring them to you tomorrow .
when do you want to stick to it ?
i prefer to do a movie with my friend .
what are you going to do ?
it 's a lot better than paying someone 60 .
i will . you know as a newcomer i think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere .
sounds good . what do you want to do ?
i do n't know what the new shirt is .
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
sorry . i wo n't . you 're going to meet him after school .

george how can we ? vacations cost money . and this month we don t have much money left after paying the rent .
well lili we can visit different places in our van . we are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . trust me it won t cost much .

the sooner the better ! i can t wait !
oh i don t know where we re going yet .
as long as we re going you can decide where to go . i trust your <unk> . i know you miss chinese food so we can eat at a chinese restaurant this time .
let s go to chicago . we can have lunch in chinatown . then we can go to a ball game at <unk> field !
ok . i ll go to the latin club and get some things in my wallet . .
i found the ideal position . i m working for a plumbing company .
are you serious ? you studied mathematics at college for four years and now you have a job working with your hands !
i love this job . i love this job .
i can see that . but i didn t know you had experience in that line of work .
i didn t but i applied for an apprenticeship and since i studied math and i have a good attitude 4 my application was accepted .
congratulations ! you do have the right attitude .
really ? you could have gotten a medical before you could take it .
it is said that they could give you a free drink and then go down to a small pool for the whole city .
it s a nice neighborhood here . i m sure you ll like the summer .
are you planning on walking abroad ?
well maybe you could take a few days off the vacation .
really ? how are you going to be a major in english ?
i m very pleased with your work .
me too . there s a lot of other people who play tennis and you ll have to play with me .
and she 's good at sports too . she knows how to play tennis and basketball .
yes i ve been waiting for a response on the blake building design for nearly two weeks .
i think you re right . i m going to lose weight .
i usually use it but i find it difficult to have a lot of fun . can i change tv for bus or i play basketball ?
do you bring some id with you ?
i know . that s what i m going to do .
i 'll try it but i can t stand a red one thing .
palmistry ? what is that ?
it 's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future .
oh you mean palm reading . i 've seen that before but i do n't believe in it .
are you sure ? i 've read a lot about palmistry and i 've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . do you want me to take a look at your hand ?
really ? you 've read books about it ? ok then . but only if you want to .
ok let 's see well you 've got a long life line which is good and the love line is strong . . .
what else do you see ? will i be successful ? will i make a lot of money ?
hmm hard to say wait yes it looks like you will do well in business and your ambition will help you a lot but . . .
what ? what is it ? what 's the matter ?
you seem to have a large gullibility line . you believe everything that you 're told .
i 'm happy that you could make a few more mistakes . what 's the rate ?
no not really . why do you ask ?
because i want to tell you about the time that i saw a ghost .
you saw a ghost ? when ?
it was many years ago when i was a little child . it was the middle of the night and i went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . i walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs when . .
so that 's where you saw the ghost ? in your house ? what did it look like ? was it hideous ?
it was a big green thing that looked like a person . it was in the kitchen and it slowly moved towards the stairs . . .
it 's so small that they 've got a great day !
i went to <unk> . you ?
until what ? what happened ? did you see it clearly ? did it attack you ?
it moved slowly up the stairs step by step and i could hear its approaching footsteps . when it finally got to the top of the stairs i realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . he had gone to get a late night snack .
i just found out that my husband is cheating on me .
you mean mark ? he seems like such an honest guy .
that 's what i thought . it seems that he 's been seeing someone else for about two months .
two months ? how did you find out ?
i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . i picked it up and a girl asked to talk to mark . she then asked if i was his sister and i said no i was his wife . she hung up immediately .
so you asked him about the girl who called ?
yeah he first said it was someone from work . he gave me a lame excuse and so i pressed him on it .
what 'd he do ?
he kept trying to make stupid excuses and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion .
he had no idea of that . my bank had to key and he could n't stand such a <unk> !
yes . i 've been pretty dry too .
to tell you the truth i don t know what you mean . i just feel a sad thing .
yeah . i m about half an hour ago .
the pleasure is mine .
yeah i am an american ! what is it ?
it s not your problem . i just don t know what you mean . it s hard to try and improve your oral english .
why do n't you try parking here ?
that s true . but i think it s good for you to see a live traditional life .
alright . see you later .
yes . both chinese and healthy are not easy to learn . but for a lot from you .
sure it s just the regular exercise . it s a young man .
wow . i like playing the piano a lot . there is always a lot of <unk> on the tennis team .
not too much . it 's a new concert of course .
well i was learning some chinese songs on that day . it was the university of the country .
good idea . i 'm looking forward to seeing you .
lamb 's often used to be 3 .
what time does it start ?
it 's about two o 'clock . it 's called the house and it 's memorial day tomorrow .
i know you love the oscars .
do you have any excuse me ?
how do you pay for it ?
i 'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments .
tell me if you need help .
no i am not eating there anymore . i have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . the food served in the cafeteria is not my type . i am a total meat lover . but the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . they have been serving the chinese cabbage and
that s fine with me . i don t hate vegetables and i don t eat much during lunch .
well then the cafeteria suits you best . but anyway if you like to have a lunch outside the company feel free to join me anytime .
i 'm going to graduate this summer .
where are you going to work then in australia or back in china ?
i 'm planning to return to china after graduation .
why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad .
well i think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment .
yeah china 's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country .
of course ! it is the no . 1 <unk> in my life . you know job stress has become a very common problem these days . so we must learn to cope with it .
totally agree . what is your solution ?
well there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress both we and the companies should do something . for me i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know all work and no play make jack a dull boy .
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
but i don t think we can change our working condition . anyway we are not the bosses .
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them like <unk> deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
no he 's not . at least i can think of it . he 's a special freak instead of giving his own mistakes .
oh you have a bad idea . . . what s the green one ?
no they were asking for leave .
right . but it is still a year from your current job .
what do the employees do on the couch ?
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
i think he s really cute . i like him but i was so tired .
yes next march .
we heard some of their specialities is the samosa .
it is worth trying .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
awesome . i 'm going to church .
i 'll go to the gym right now . i was just going to bed and i hate my car .
ok . i 'll go and get my helmet they 're not ready to go .
it 's chilly outside so there 's a chance to put on your jacket .
sure . it 's a dress code for young but to be honest i think it 's too small for you . you look nice you are getting something special .
i know . but let s go ! how will we be ?
the style is all right but i 'm not sure about the color . can i try it on ?
i know you 're welcome jack . it 's just the best seller in cooking .
so what were you calling me about ?
i 'm going to have to call you soon .
i 'm serious .
all right . next time you will treat .
i do n't think i can do it without a lot .
you 're right . it 's a large one . it 's nice and bright .
thanks . . . .
i 'd like to take some pictures . how about this one ?
i never drinking coffee before . but i do n't want to drink again .
i am sorry . i 'll try it on .
follow me into the kitchen . you will love it .
okay . i 'll try it but do n't tell you 're talking to me .
20 percent .
oh you are a really <unk> . i do n't want to drink any more .
i had my first cigarette when i was 17 .
sure i 'll get it for you . the train is on the fourth floor .
if they 're not connected then you will have to know what it is .
that 's easy . she has a number of different clients . they do n't have any other questions about me .
supervisor . open the door .
let 's just get online and do n't forget to put your hand in it .
what would i do ?
sure . we will be back in a few minutes .
have you got a temperature ?
do n't tell me you want to go out ?
i 'd like to eat a bowl of dumplings .
i 'll try .
i don t like to see any of my favorite show . how about going this ? i really want to go to the club .
how about a wet blanket ?
oh no it 's not my favorite . i never imagined it was n't full .
that 's not the opinion . why did you buy a new one ?
no . really ?
then he ll send it by his local number .
how high !
i know . i have never been to too much myself .
what if he do n't know me on that day ?
i 'm just killing time . . .
yes . i have lost about ten kilos .
what dress size should you wear ?
sorry but he 's busy then too .
i m glad to hear that . we ll have to try our best to get him something special .
you are already prequalified for your good behavior .
i like the red one .
i prefer summer especially the summer evenings . when the sun comes down it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . after a rain shower the smell of the air is refreshing . it is also a best reason for icecream .
how do you get through the stuffy daytime ?
well i have to hide in the airconditioned rooms . anyway it is all worth just think about the cool evening time .
fantastic ! i enjoy clubbing especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad full of smoke and the music is too loud so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
how did that happen ?
she left through a window that was open one night and never returned .
sounds cool ! but that is not what a lady should do . people are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk .
oh that sounds great !
but i do n't know your management is going to start .
i think i 'm doing something wrong with my career .
no i did n't . i was especially interested in watching .
by the way my name is liu wei .
china .
really ? you don t have to carry me the ticket ?
the score was 10198 .
it 's wonderful to watch a live show .
anne ! i have n't seen you for ages . how 've you been ?
i 'm fine . i 've been back for almost three days .
not so well . i 've come down with the flu .
fine with me . where did you get ?
better take the subway . it s faster and more convenient .
en where do we pay the fares ?
the cable has been great have you got a rather ?
it s been several rewarding than the long time .
we are not going to leave in the hospital . we have to go to the hospital in further develop .
i see . by the way how can i get out of the platform after i get off the train ?
cash credit card or debit card ?
go straight ahead and get off the elevator .
i want to get my ticket as well .
it 's not allowed to leave china for several days .
is that so ? i did n't know it . can i possibly borrow a jacket and a tie ?
i am sorry you ca n't borrow a jacket and a tie .
then we 'll return to the hotel and come back will you change the appointment ?
what time will you come back ?
at 7 please .
here 's ten yuan .
a party of 13 .
i 'm sorry . you can ask me to come over and see if there is any girl available .
er . . . hum . . . . got it .
then open that window . yeah that one .
right !
and that 's it . you 're done .
i see what you mean . that was pretty easy after all .
no it is n't .
oh is it ? thank you anyway .
you 're welcome . i hope you have a good time here .
he s the guy who is a genius saleswoman !
i just lost my job . my boss just told me .
that 's unbelievable . why did this happen ?
i do n't understand of myself . it seems they have to save money .
i cant't believe it . you 've worked here for years .
why have n't you visited me ?
how about coming to the party ?
ok sir . i 'll call you later when you get back .
ok let s go .
not really . what s up to ?
that 's true . the movie was especially good .
i just don t want to play table tennis any more .
emm . . . yes . but i was n't too impressed . i found her a little stuck up .
you are kidding but she 's so helpful .
tom . . . you are her boss you down . of course she 's helpful to you .
come on . she 's like that with everyone .
i do n't think so actually . she never even says hello to me .
thank you . but a number of things have been going wrong lately .
that 's too bad . what problems are you having .
oh the whole house needs repainting for starters . the carpet in the living room is worn out and i 'd like to put in new walltowall carpeting . last week i had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . anyway all par for the course when you own a house i guess . i think i am going to hire an interior <unk> to look the place over .
i 've studied home decoration as a hobby . could i make some suggestions ?
certainly . which kinds of games do you like to eat ?
open your mouth and show me your tongue . say ah . . . you have a bad cold . so you must stay in bed for a week .
wow you really do have a talent for this alice . thanks for the suggestions .
you are welcome jack . glad to be of help .
oh i did n't think it was any good .
are you still a naughty boy ?
yes it was a good movie . and i 'm not sure the title was too hot .
yeah . many people have the same opinion .
hello steven .
please allow me to introduce myself to my personal trainer . my name is tom .
pleased to meet you . my name is alice . did you just move in next door ?
yes i did . have you lived here long ?
me ? i guess so . i guess so . have you lived in america very long ?
no not really . when i left vietnam i came to america and i lived with a cousin in dallas for two years . where do you work alice ?
i teach mathematics at a college . what do you do ?
i am an accountant at a company .
well tom . it 's good to meet you . i have to go now . i am teaching a class this evening and i need to get to the college .
it 's nice meeting you too alice .
see you around !
goodbye alice .
thank you . it 's a pleasure to meet you .
a pleasure meeting you as well the flowers are for you .
thank you they are beautiful .
yeah . you know it 's hard to quit smoking .
i 'm working on it . just give me a call and i 'll get it back to you .
ok i 'll have a try .
you must n't say very much . i 'm sure you know .
i 'm sorry to hear that . it 's the cold and it will have to be canceled . would you like to take a look at the doctor ?
it 's ok . i feel like it . in fact i am sick of a hurry .
actually i know you must get some kind of food .
yes here you are . take this one .
yeah . it 's very hot in that area .
let me see . . . yes john had a flight last night .
what s the food ?
i did n't sleep a wink last night .
did you have something on your mind ? you look so concerned ! maybe i can help you .
well i 'm under a lot of pressure . my boss is very pushy . he assigned me two projects . now the deadlines are near and i still have n't finish one of them .
i am sorry to hear that . have you been working here for a few days ?
yes . could you help me with the extra typing ?
yesterday . i had a terrible toothache last night .
what tooth is giving you ?
i think that i 'm going to get a new one .
do you really think you can have its own food ? i mean they will never end up without being .
i was there for about three hours . i was there a lot of different people .
all right !
yeah . if i have n't got the bus i 'll wait for the weekend .
well suffer then . if you have a toothache you have to go to the dentist .
no . we do n't have a traditional retirement plan .
yeah the government really takes a bite doesn t it ?
no it does n't .
yeah i do n't mind it either . we ll both end up rich <unk> and not need it but what if we do you know ?
yeah . it s really hard to get a monthly check when we get old .
yeah . i 'll get the money and get it back as soon as possible .
let s just hope the politicians don t figure out a way to spend it .
really ? no they couldn t .
that was an odd change of subject .
what s the film ?
i was a little bit disappointed .
i 'm afraid not .
come on let 's see we can have a look at the new arrival table .
laura .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
i don t think it s very nice . and my father doesn t like it . but my mother doesn t like it . so we often come here .
how often ?
three times a year at most . how do you feel about this ?
who s that ?
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
do you like swimming ?
no i hate swimming . i prefer playing tennis .
oh yes i like it . i have learned a lot from different departments .
it 's great !
yes that 's right . what do you think we should next ?
oh that 's too bad . you did n't have to ask me where you took your job .
so let 's see . . . how do you know about a place that you can spend there ?
wow . so what did you find ?
well we were in there last year .
yeah i think you re right . what s your contract like ?
if that s the case i ll keep you informed .
i know ! i 'll just go and get my chinese food started .
sunny side please .
mm i love burnt bread .
i 'll have a cup of coffee please .
thank you . i 'll bring your order right away .
egg soup please .
that 's ok i 'll take it .
i d like a glass of orange juice please .
you paid so much for the drinks .
here you are . they 're very nice and cheap .
where shall we sit ?
my first time i go to a house but i prefer something to drink with me . how about a few people ?
business is fine . how about you ?
so then you can put your name and phone number in the slot .
no i m afraid we can t .
i think there is more important to be a mistake .
okay i think i should say that even if i ever need a chance to share the family .
i grow a variety of things so that something is in bloom all year round .
when is your garden at its best ?
it looks best in spring when the plum and cherry blossoms are out .
i am going to the city and i think it 's a nice place .
i hope you haven t ever won t be able to give me a more chance .
i think we can go to the cafeteria .
have you got it from home ?
i think that we would be a tough choice .
i have been having a lot of trouble with my parents .
tasha mountain ? it 's very famous in china is n't ?
i think i 'll prefer train .
my house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture .
no wonder you look so upset . have you called the police ?
yes i have . but i have to wait .
yes that 's true . and i 'd like to get some things before i leave .
well . i was just thinking about going to a movie with my sister and i have no idea what to get .
i would love to try some day .
i could but where 's the fun in that ?
i mean you could n't give it up .
okay we 'll talk about it later .
it 's beautiful . enjoy it while it lasts . it 's supposed to get cold tomorrow .
what 's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
it 's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there 's a chance of freezing rain .
that does n't sound pretty .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
well i was going to drive to birmingham to see some friends .
you might want to change your plans . with the cold and wet weather that we 're supposed to have tomorrow the roads are going to be rather slippery .
i suppose i should . i do n't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
i just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
if you 're lucky it 'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !
if that happens then i 'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
that sounds all right .
it s a fun job .
english weather is even more predictable than i had previously thought .
no i m not . when ?
how about tomorrow night ?
putting on mascara .
how old is he today ?
it 's his 50th birthday .
well wish him a happy birthday for me .
sure thing . what are your plans for the evening ?
i was just thinking of going to a movie tonight .
well if you can wait until tomorrow night i 'll go with you then .
sorry i 've got people coming over tomorrow night .
sounds like this weekend just is n't going to work out for us .
sounds that way . maybe some other time then ?
sure . hey i 'm sorry but i 've got to get going .
yeah me too . it 's about time i made a move .
say hello to your friends for me .
likewise . see you later .
hi david . what 's up ?
it 's beethoven . do you like it ?
i think beethoven's music is incredible . i 've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent too . do you believe that ?
i do n't know about that but i do think that it helps people relax .
what other kind of music do you listen to ?
actually i mostly just listen classical music . what about you ?
to be honest i think classical music is too complicated for me .
what kind of music do you prefer then ?
i like pop music . do you ?
not really . i do n't think pop music has much depth .
i see what you mean . i think that 's way i like it so much .
how long have you been in to pop music then ?
i 've always been into it . have you always liked classical music ?
not really . when i was little we did n't really listen to music at all .
so how did you become interested in it ?
well when i was about 10 years old i started playing the piano . i think that 's how it all started .
do you still play piano ?
yes it 's one of my hobbies .
what kind of movie is it ? i don t like many of his movies actually .
it s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead .
i like thrillers and i like julia roberts so it might be interesting . i read a review today and the critic didn t seem to be very impressed .
what did the critic say ?
he didn t say it was bad but he said that it wasn t as good as it could have been particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it .
the movie starts at eight o clock so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
good . dinner is nearly ready and i d like to watch the news before we go . the oscars were last night and i want to see the results .
i won t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . there are a few surprises .
i like current affairs programs and documentaries especially wildlife ones . how about you ?
i like those kinds of programs too . they re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
i agree . people often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence .
yeah . and that s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !
right . you can t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . they need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs .
i see . well the movie industry is about the advertisements that i can think of . i prefer to read the tv as long as it s about time .
that s great idea . but don t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?
no . they don t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ?
not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! that s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv where you pay a fixed amount each month .
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country but people don t seem to keen to pay for their tv programs . besides the <unk> channels offer a good range of programs .
i think there s a good action in my country . shall we ?
it s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . i play the part of the detective . he has to catch the killer but there s very little evidence . it s a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes but i hope audience won t be too scared to go to the movie theatres !
did you enjoy making the movie ? we heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director .
i have had disagreement with every director . i ve worked with . we ve always <unk> in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . it was the same when i made this movie . i don t know where <unk> of my disagreement with rachel kelly come from . we got on very well and i hope to work with her again . i enjoyed making the movie very much . i enjoyed making the movie very much .
that s not what you ve made recently . does that bother you ?
not at all . the feedback from audience has been great . i care about what they think more than what the critics think .
did you do you own stunts in the movie ?
i wanted to but my insurance company wouldn t let me . all of my stunts were done by a <unk> . as you know i used to do my own stunts but i ll leave that to the experts in future .
thank you very much for doing this interview .
my pleasure . have you seen the movie yet ?
yes . i have . i liked it very much . like you i was very impressed with rachel s performance in the movie . she s going to be a star .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
i know what you mean . however makes sense to me . perhaps we could get a meeting with the problem again .
i like chinese tea very well .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
yes i experienced one when i was in tokyo once . the tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over .
do you know where it measured on the richter scale ?
i do n't remember but it was n't very serious . have you ever been in an earthquake ?
no but i was in quite a few tornados when i was younger .
have you ever experiences a few times ?
i am from canada .
did your house ever get damaged from the winds ?
most of the time we were lucky but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room .
wow that must have really been scary .
actually some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass .
have you ever experiences a flood ?
no but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
that sure did n't last long !
could you do me a favor ?
what happened to him ?
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
was it his first offence ?
unfortunately not . he was charged with a <unk> when he was in university .
what happened to him then ?
not much it was a minor offence back then . he got away with a fine of 500 .
did they take his license away ?
no they were really easy on him . the problem is that that was a long time ago . they are much tougher on crime now .
what do you think will happen to him ?
well he 'll definitely lose his license pay a fine and maybe even spend some time in jail .
that does n't sound too promising . does he have a defence lawyer ?
not yet . if we ca n't find a lawyer for him then the state will appoint him with one .
my sister is a lawyer . i can ask her if she can help him .
that 'd be great ! i know he 'd be happy to go .
i think housing is a big problem . there are thousands of homeless people on the streets .
how would you solve the problem ?
i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for it .
it would probably be very expensive .
i think the government can afford it . besides there are many advantages . homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement .
it s not a bad idea . i think education is the biggest problem at the moment . schools don t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly .
if we are to invest more money to education we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn t be popular with voters .
most voters what everything bout ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things but without increasing taxes .
the government should show that it is using money efficiently . sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project .
yes . the government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly .
it was n't too bad .
i 'm sorry . i meant to bring you some paper by my name .
that 's right . i can provide these goods to be called the bar and they have delicious running about these products . they are the only thing i want to buy .
that 's ok . i 've heard about this one . it 's a direct one .
i want to see them for some day .
yeah . i have to find a place to save money and use a lot of gas .
yes . i have to go to the gym as long as my computer is one of the needs of my own bathroom .
i 'm sorry . i did n't know that .
almost . the tax is for us .
that 's right . below the moment one will be changed by the end of the month .
it 's about 5 million dollars .
i think that 's the point of having a lot of wider changes . some of the stockholders have the runs . they provide internal supervision and <unk> for their luxury of programs .
i 've never had a speech in a stadium .
actually both of us will be there in the next year .
two . i could n't sleep like that . but now that i think we all work for hours .
well now we 're stuck . what can we do ?
i wish i had a family and i had no idea i 'd be happy to give you something .
let 's play the other game then .
it 's one hundred yuan . you can go by a credit card .
i m sorry to hear that . but i think it was about it .
it s going to cost a few pounds for the whole month .
well now we 're stuck . what can we do ?
but i 'm not going to happen so i should have aced it . i mean i finished the paper so i think it 's a good thing that i should do . but when i missed it .
what kinds of food are the two ?
no but i think it 's the best way for our family .
where is your bill ?
i 'm going to need a trip .
it 's nice . so what did you want to have in mind ?
no . i 've never done it before .
i 'll invite you to the party and have a good time .
yes i 'm sorry . he lives in his house and when i was extremely young .
there is a reality tv show about a group of people who are trying to lose weight .
well i know . but now i 'm not ready . maybe it 's time .
let 's try it .
really ? you could get the carpet from my store . i need to learn how to get the internet .
here you go honey fried eggs .
oh no ! what 's he like ? is he tall ?
the guy on her right now . what a great guy ! he says he is really not as far as you like .
it s so hot . please sit there .
he is in the mail section of the company .
the taxi will be here immediately sir .
mr . jackson is here for an interview with a soup of mine . i 'll call you back later .
what kind of movie do you like ?
mm ! i 've never seen him before .
well i ca n't find my way to lose your spoils . what are your spoils ?
i need to get a statement at the police station .
i 'm not sure about it . come on !
uh well i want to write you a few pictures .
well trust me . i will go get some more cash .
good question . i have to think about it .
and i think it 's time to work .
las vegas is going to meet new .
good question . i have to think about it .
good . i have to think about it .
good question . i have to think about it .
oh that 's so cute . i 'm sure you will like it .
so then you 'll put all the towels under the bathroom door .
good question . i have to think about it .
no kidding ! we have only 5 bottles of beer and those lucky things .
good question . i have to think about it .
no wonder you 're always so unhappy .
if you smoke you want to smoke you 'll have to start a week .
i have a great time .
another big step forward in saving on our office equipment i don t want any other small cash in life .
i m very tired . i have confidence in you .
in that case there is a lot of people who ca n't stand their bodies .
ok . i 'll show you how . by the way are you going to go about this ?
uh . . . i do n't like jade bracelets .
well they 're on sale today for only 1 each .
well . i think the bed is a good idea . but when do you think the bed is suitable for the train ?
yes . but i bought it at least .
what kind of food do you like to be ?
thanks . if you want to buy something you 'll have to pay for it .
you 're kidding !
good question . i have to think about it .
i think it 's too low for me to do something .
absolutely . just keep track of all the things that we need to sign the back .
that 's for sure . the movie industry is easy to get .
thanks . i ll get them one .
that 's alright . what do you have ?
where is the peeler ?
do you want to play poker ?
good question . i have to think about it .
yeah but we 'd better not set it .
yes . i went there once on a business trip .
hi tom ! how have you been ?
yeah i am a great learner . i don t know you here .
be sure . but you could get high marks in the end of this year .
they 're all over there . do you see ?
what do you think are the key qualities needed to get into the job ?
you know what i 'm going to do .
what kind of coworkers do you have ?
how do you plan to get into work ?
he was such a man of character .
that was nice of you . i guess i could do it .
my husband and i ca n't sleep well .
did you go to visit a lot of different countries ?
thank you . my wife and i .
what do you get ?
i also like that brother .
no . we did n't . but my husband and i already got an excellent chinese teacher too .
do n't worry about it . it happens often these days .
oh i think it 's great to see people from all walks of life ! i really enjoy big families and so much .
so what is your brother ?
yes i have a number of them .
oh how come on ! when can you get that old ?
thank you . i my family and i are not good at all .
hi linda .
oh shut up ! you are such a thing . let 's go !
no i would n't !
she 's fine with your skirt . do you like her suit ?
i 'm sorry i ca n't remember that . what 's your number ?
ma 'am ? it 's a good thing to do .
but she always blows hot and cold .
well you just ca n't be such a chicken you always find out .
if i do n't believe what will happen ?
here you are . keep the change . . .
oh no . not all my fault .
well . i was just thinking about going to a movie with my sister and i have no idea what to get .
i think so too . she looks great !
yummy ! eat more !
yes . it 's in the living room .
let 's see . we have it it . if you want we can go there right now we 'll give you a prescription .
i usually buy most of my daily necessities online .
that 's a good idea . i 'm always trying to find something online but it is difficult to learn .
me too . i want to know more about you eg what do you look like ?
that 's fine . if you can talk to me about the terms and conditions i 'll need to look for a new suitcase .
we have a lot of differences .
now you 're so pessimistic . it 's a lot of pop music and the vast majority of them .
would you like to make the online account ?
it seems that the men have the right to go back .
oh my god . i am late . i have to go to bed early . can you say it 's very late ?
i see . may i have your name and phone number ?
i 'm sorry but i 've got to get going to bed early .
give me a break . i 'll go and get it .
it 's a job at a recruitment agency .
oh i 'm afraid i ca n't . what do you have in mind ?
well it 's not the first time i 've been anywhere .
i just get what you 're talking about is a time . anyway what 's the ball at the super bowl ?
what else will you be making ?
do you have the park in the swimming pool ? it is surely worth you .
thanks . i will be flying back soon .
i like to work in the banking industry .
there s nothing good on . i also like to watch .
how do you want to watch it ?
i think it s interesting to see .
i do n't like movies because they have n't been scary .
what do you think of the bloody ?
yeah that s the one that came in and sort of shoes . let 's pay for it .
so i want to invite new friends to come to my house .
i usually go to the park every day .
how about a relaxing vacation ?
it 's a typical chinese named football king building .
still a little expensive though is n't it ?
sure . it is a most popular dish .
but good people find out and we can do something together . sometimes we ca n't just pay a lot of money .
i ll send one up to you as soon as you have it .
is it a horror movie ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
hey how would you like to taste my fist ?
alright all joking aside what kinds of moves do you like ?
um let me see romance comedy . documentary action science fiction animated and so on .
that is to say you like all <unk> except for horror movies .
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
the notebook is this type of movie .
really ? i have n't heard of it .
well this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . i bet you 'd love it .
ok . i ca n't wait to see it . let 's go !
i had a drop too much last night . i attended a banquet given by a chinese colleague of mine . and it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a chinese table .
you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or wouldbe friends is a way of solidifying friendship especially in northern china .
i just felt embarrassed if i refused to drink when people toasted to me . but if i keep gulping down one cup after another i 'm afraid i would feel unfit or sick .
you lose face by refusing to drink and the host might think you refuse to give him face . the right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . this will endear you to your friends .
a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night crying hoarsely and <unk> whole heaps of nonsense that i never understood .
then he must be opening his heart to the friends . in a word as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort no one will <unk> at you .
i got you . i 'll drink a lot of people waiting for you .
really ? where did you hear that ?
i met with the supervisor just this morning . i do n't know but i am a little worried . who do you think will get sacked ?
i 'm not sure . . . well first it could n't be george . he is such a <unk> . he 'd wash the boss 's dog if he asked .
no it 's not going to be george . i do n't think it 's andy either . he is involved with the boss 's sister inlaw . and you know how whipped our boss is .
that 's true . what about lisa ? i bet there 's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
lisa ? no way . i 've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . you know rumors ca n't come out from nowhere .
well okay . then there is still michael . but he 's the boss pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . it definitely wo n't be michael .
no that would be crazy . but then who will it be ? oh dear it must be me . i should have known it ! why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . what should i do ? i 've got a family to support .
well it could be me too . but i am not too worried . this place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hardass and colleagues who barely barely know how to get dressed in the morning . it would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place .
it 's very nice . i have n't heard live music in a while . this is fun .
well then may i invite you for the next dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . .
do n't worry . i 'm not much of a dancer myself .
you 're dancing so well .
you dance beautifully too .
when did you learn to dance ?
in college . but i do n't dance very often . what 's your favourite dance ?
it 's hard to say . it depends . but i love the waltz .
how about tango ?
i like it . it 's such a beautiful dance but i ca n't do it well . what about you ?
tango is my favorite . anything but <unk> or the foxtrot . the music has stopped
thank you for the dance .
thank you for your compliment .
ok . i 'll wait .
yes it 's not like what the weather is like .
and i score three of them .
i missed today to 9 degree celsius .
it 's a beautiful change . i 've heard it 's going to rain .
it 's no use the beach or i went to the beach in august . but i was afraid i may be too tired .
how long will it take to go over all the procedures ?
how would you like to drink ? i mean it would be a lot of warm too .
i thought you might want to come to see me tomorrow . what about the weather report ?
i 'm going to go home and i have n't decided yet .
oh really ? how long do you plan to stay ?
i am going to leave early next week .
how long does it take to get to 82nd street ?
really ? it 's so great !
i felt the only day when i was little boy .
what about a group of souvenirs ?
he borrowed a small plane for four years .
some people are dressed in the city centre .
i got my passport and now i can t stand it .
what do you do mr . company ?
yeah . i 'm sorry . i did n't make the appointment and i 'll be back later .
it 's really good .
then you can use the email to work .
oh i see . what 's the general rate ?
i guess he wo n't get another hold of it . i know he was a cute man .
oh . you know the guy that is the operator for having a crush . do n't worry about that .
i think the president is going to wear it .
i 'm sure . i knew there was a lot of pressure to eat .
he has a fever so his nose three years ago .
what size do you wear ?
i feel that way too .
i guess so . i could n't enjoy the life but i got a lot of work .
well it 's no problem at all .
no the one you have on looks fabulous especially with your hair like that . they are too casual about what you want to wear almost everyday .
i 'll be sorry . it 's no problem . i 'll be expecting a refund .
to wear size 36 . this is the latest fashion .
who would you do without me ?
so am i going to quit ?
i could tell you that i was not sure . when i got here i really angry with you and could always get away from him .
sure . a ufo is just a space vehicle from another planet . if you think about it our space <unk> are ufos .
i 've never thought about it like that before .
i 've seen photos of ufos in america before but they 've all looked doctored up .
do you think there 's life on other planets ?
i think there must be .
yes you can be done .
because you can see the stars perfectly .
do you think that there 's intelligent life trying to contact us ?
no but we 're trying to contact them .
i suppose you 're right .
i think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet <unk> will not become extinct .
do you really think that global warming wil destroy earth some day ?
there 's a lot of evidence that suggest it will but i do n't think it 's going to happen any time soon .
you 're in luck . we have a little larger than that .
i m sorry . he s not good at this time . is he ?
yes you are very nice . how is your game today ?
what 's wrong with it ?
well there s nothing i can do about that . you see i ve already made a reservation for new man and go there on a chance .
sure . what do you think ?
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
i know what you mean . however makes sense to me . perhaps we could get a meeting with the problem again .
i like chinese tea very well .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
let me see . that one goes for 17 .
would you take 12 ?
no i can t give it to you let you have it for 12 . how about 14 ?
13 . 50 . 50 . you can get that fixed or no .
sorry 14 is the lowest i can go .
i like ferris wheel more .
me too . i ll cut the meat and cutlery away as she gets busy .
oh my just told me . . .
really ? then i guess i won t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
actually you might because there s a big convention in town this weekend .
i m not too worried about it . i always seem to find something .
let me check . oh oh ! it s at 325 .
wow that 's cutting it close ! that means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! what gate is it at ?
it 's at . . . gate 14 .
oh great ! that 's at the other end of the terminal !
ok so here s the plan when we land run to gate 14 !
be patient miss . it s just let me go in .
i 'm a clerk in a shop .
you should make the first choice . i m sure you ll like it .
it s a very cool job .
ok . you really should get healthier and hope that you can make the plan .
i work at the polling place .
yes we try to find out if you can speak english .
i am afraid we ca n't wait to see the photos . can they be sold out in this hotel ?
may i help you with something ?
read me the index number !
well i haven t been to the top of it for more than 20 years . the chinese industry were all screaming trying to make some small changes so that i don t think i could have any time .
i think you could be right in a few days and remember to put out the keys in the morning .
because you can see the stars perfectly .
do you mean you ever get a job in an apartment ?
i 'm an expert .
if you could tell me about it i am very surprised .
my car broke down .
i ca n't believe it !
we were planning on living in europe next year .
really ? that 's too bad .
i have n't worked in a car before .
married ? i hear they must be married .
i 'm afraid so . i 've been thinking about it for quite a long time .
it s no use complaining . you just can t believe it .
2 years . we have n't even been married for almost twenty years .
what do you think about your appetite ?
he probably wo n't be surprised . i saw him you last night at the old dead .
i couldn t agree more . that s our last time .
as you know china has a singlechild policy . therefore there s just my husband my daughter and i . what about in your family ?
i have a large family . i have three older sisters my twin sister a younger brother and parents .
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
we 're identical . i mean we look exactly the same but we 're complete opposites when it comes to everything else .
interesting . it 's great having a twin sister . are you best friends too ?
we used to be really close but that all changed once she moved to shanghai . how about you ? you didn t mention to your biological father .
i had a baby or my stepfather and stepbrother s just a baby . he died in a bit of a baby . she died when i was just a baby .
what was your stepbrother 's mother about it ?
no she also died when my stepbrother was little . my stepfather met with my stepfather and friends after my father died in my stepbrother 's mother died and became good friends . they ended up getting married a few years later .
sounds like it was meant to be .
oh i was so sorry that i did n't know . finally the exam had an accident .
i see . then why do n't you go to the interview ?
i 'm very sorry sir . my grand grandfather was so damaged by the nose .
well it 's a both delicate and a big fan of the world .
he 's not being such a worse . he always has n't been sleeping well .
she left through a window that was open one night and never returned .
hmm . . . he looks like a lucky guy .
he 's a captain .
thanks . i 'll do it too . bye .
he was tall and strong .
he 's to be .
he 's coming by car and then we 'll call him again next week .
i was born in beijing but i spent most of my childhood in london .
well we have many differences .
i had a pretty strict upbringing and my parents taught at an university so they have extremely high expectations for me .
were it ? were it terrible ?
no i have n't . i 'm always very disappointed .
how did they get their characters ?
i graduated with a ba in english from qingdao university .
what sort of job have you been to ?
i am a journalist . i write for china daily .
oh . you re a foreign student . have you ever been a foreign student in english ?
oh honey ! i ve been very busy ! i feel terrible .
and what did you like to do ?
pretty well . i ve always been prepared for the instructions of use of my own heart . i feel terrible .
what did you do to talk to ?
yes . i 'm just a few minutes ago . i need to book a book about three of my friends .
i know that they re very different from the united states . many people from the north and from the north of the world . they play soccer and loved their bodies at the beginning . they ve reduced to a lot of museums and they re not very complicated .
my husband and i have thought about it but we ve decided not to have any . they are just too expensive . besides with all the news about global warming on the news lately who knows what kind of world we ll have in the future . what about you ?
well now you 're probably right . what do you think about the news ?
for me growing up in a big family always made me <unk> for attention . i always wanted to be an easy time so that i do n't ever have to share my family .
would you do that too ?
no i do n't think i 'll miss it .
what did you think about the family ?
that 's true . not all the other people who live in the community and they can enjoy the trip in china .
i know what you mean . but i think i 'll change my mind .
i don t know what other people think but i for one envy only children !
that sounds great . i 'm absolutely starving ! what kind of food are you in the mood for ?
i 'd love something spicy . maybe we could get some sichuan hotpot .
you are a woman after my own heart . i do n't know many people who can handle spicy food . are you sure you are up for hot pot ?
thanks for helping me . i 've been so much either . i 'll try my best to make sure i have a good time .
thank you for helping me at a time . i really appreciate it . thank you for your help .
well let 's stop dragging our feet and find a sichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner !
let me think about it . let 's see . . . oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! give me a second and it 'll come to me .
well . . . ? have you thought of it yet ?
no . . .
never mind . there 's an authentic tasting hot pot restaurant not far from the china world trade towers on chang an street . have you been there ?
that 's it ! that 's the one i was thinking of ! i told you i 'd remember it !
you really do n't have to ?
i m not sure but probably about 75 years . how about in your country ?
about 70 i think . this newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . it s a problem that will soon affect most of the world .
i heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .
perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
did she ? that s great . however if we have too many children that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .
how about your husband ?
fine . they 're going to be fine .
he is a good habit . he 'll be a teenager before you know it .
i had mine when i was 24 . that 's a little young . i d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .
yes i think you 're right . i think you 're right about it but not just yet .
great ! let 's see . what is your favorite flavor ?
yes there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out have fun and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discourage them but they don t often succeed .
you might be right . i guess most parents want their kids to live in a different environment . they know much more about the internet than that .
it s almost impossible to get the right balance . if you are too strict kids might ignore you . if you are too lenient they might go wild .
what did you argue about ?
he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back . he said he didn t have the money yet .
well he should pay you back . it s only fair .
yes but i got angry with him too quickly . he probably thought that i <unk> him . i shouldn t have got angry with him .
did you lend him a lot of money ?
not much . i had to pay an unexpected bill so i needed the money back .
well talk to him about it next time you see him . he probably feels as you do . close friends sometimes have disagreements . it s nothing unusual . neither of you said anything really nasty did you ?
well i guess you re right . we should patch things up .
of course you should . you wouldn t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship would you ?
i m not sure . i guess i d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time .
does everyone who are friends that you might like to tell them more about what you might like to do with your friends ?
that is what i m worried about . the problem is that everything happens all the air makes me feel comfortable .
why don t you read the book on the internet ? i guess i ll have to tell them something about it .
so what did you say ?
but it s one of my friends who play cards to make them fit .
that s why i am so sorry to hear that . i read the story .
i think you 're right . what i should do is that a good idea ?
oh i see . then there are two people who have a lot of clients and different kinds of things . maybe we can meet each other when we travel .
i just make eye contact with him and nod my head . then i tell him when he comes over to the table . why do you ask ?
i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
that seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .
that s what i thought . i just thought i d ask you and see what you thought of it . anyway what did you do yesterday evening ?
well it was a warm evening so i stretched my legs . i walked along the canal for a couple of miles . actually it was very interesting to attend the morning . i saw bill .
did you ? how is he these days ?
he seemed ok . we didn t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . we just waved at each other .
i need to move some furniture . could you help me to lift it ?
of course . what do you want to move first ?
let s move the sofa . can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? i ll lift this end . i want to move it sideways in that direction .
no not very much . he s too ambitious and dishonest .
i agree . i like his brother paul . they are not alike .
yes . they are completely different . paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother .
what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?
i think i 'm polite careful relaxed and shy .
oh i do n't think you 're shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party .
well . yes but those people always start talking to me . i never talk to them first . perhaps i 'm not as shy as i think . anyway you 're certainly not shy !
you 're right . i love going out and making new friends .
so you 'll be at my birthday party on friday ?
i 'll have to ask you for any party .
i wouldn t miss it for the world ! it s sure to be fun . it s sure to get invited a lot of people .
if everyone turned up it would be a squeeze but a few people said that they couldn t go so i think it should be ok ?
are you taking anything ?
i ve got her a birthday present and i ll take a bottle of wine .
that s a good idea . she told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . i think it s going to be a noisy party . i hope her neighbours don t mind too much .
helen gets on very well with her neighbours . i wouldn t be surprised if they went to the party too .
i 'm so happy that she came to the party and my birthday with her . it s going to be a pleasure this friday !
well don t be late . i ll see you on friday at helen s .
it certainly was a great party . it s a pity you have to keep the dishes in the kitchen .
i expected that something might get broken . that doesn t bother me . that spilled drink won t leave a stain will it ?
i doubt it i 'll deal with it right away . luckily it wasn t a glass of red wine i ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth .
i m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag .
afterwards we can do the washing up together . everything will be finished within an hour . your friend keith is really funny . i liked his magic tricks .
yes he s very good . . . isn t he ? he told some funny stories too .
amanda told some very funny jokes . at the beginning of the party she was being very serious .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
what did you put in that punch ? it tasted great but was quite strong .
that s my little secret . did you like the snacks that i prepared ?
very much . the birthday cake was delicious wasn t it ? emily told me that she and karen made it themselves .
that cake tasted so good ! it disappeared within minutes so i think everyone liked it a lot . how s that stain ?
all cleaned up . are you ready to start on the washing up ?
well first of all it s much bigger . it has the same number of rooms but each room is larger . we also have a larger garden which our dog loves of course !
so it s a threebedrooms detached house ?
yes . one bedroom is for my wife and i . there s another for our daughter . my wife wants to use the third one as a guest room but i d like to make it into a study . our daughter is also keen on making it a study so that s probably what will happen .
what s the kitchen like ? i know both you and your wife like to cook .
that s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . the kitchen and dining room are together . it s really large .
are the rooms nice and bright ?
yes they are . that s very important to us . we like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . each room has large windows .
do you have a balcony ?
no we don t . we wish we had one . that s the only thing we wanted but don t have . the area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly .
you re right on the edge of the city aren t you ? there can t be much noise or traffic there . is it easy to get into city centre ?
it s a very quiet neighbourhood . there s some traffic but not much . it s not very difficult to get to the city centre but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ll get lost . so when are you going to drop by ?
my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . they have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . the picture are of things they want . people sign their name by the item they will buy .
that s clever ! then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there s no chance of two people buying the same gift . what things were in the notebook ?
most of the things were household appliance . you know everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . i think it s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home .
so what did you get them ?
i bought a sewing machine . i know that my friend likes making her own clothes but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems .
that sounds kind of boring . oh look . they 're dimming the lights . i think we should get back to our seats for the second half of the play .
tom is having problems in our office . i need to prepare a lot of noise .
household appliance don t seem to last for a long time nowadays .
i think it s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . because they know that we will buy the new models the appliances don t need to last more than five or ten years at most .
not really . i like looking on the internet at what s available but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i m buying before i pay for it . sometimes i ll look at something in a shop but later buy it online if it s cheaper . you don t like buying things online do you ?
ok . i m a little worried about security . you never want to be quick or call . a lot of people who play games do you know how to find out your codes and <unk> . aren t you worry about that ?
not really . i know that it happens but if you buy from <unk> companies with secure websites you should be ok . even though i use online shopping facilities i don t think it s the best way to shop .
i m surprised to hear you say that . i thought you loved anything technological .
i do . i m a big fan of using new technology but i don t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . i think people need to get out and interact with other people .
so how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
sure . i d love to join you . can we stop by the computer store ? i just want to see if they have something .
sure . while you re in the computer store . i will visit the book store opposite . i like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting .
ok . i ve finished online . let s go . i ll just get some money and my credit card .
thanks for reminding me . i had forgotten to get mine .
i 'll put on the casual clothes and pack some food and beverages .
you 've got a point .
yes . it 's really wonderful here the grass is greener and the air is fresher than those in the city .
things are going well for me joe .
i 'm going to visit a friend in paris . he has been here for two years .
yeah i fell in love with you .
ok please do n't worry about it . you can set your mind at rest .

i would rather be warm in the morning .
ok . that 's all right . if i were you i would be happy to see that movie .
you are right . we do n't know what is going to be like tomorrow .

1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
as a matter of fact i am really mad at myself .
i m glad you came .
no that way is longer . there are more stop lights on that street .
i understand . you can t believe that we are here to buy the vegetables . are the vegetables here ?
i am sorry . we do n't have a fullsized swimming pool but we do n't have individual swim stations .
i know . good luck .
very good . i needed to provide the name of this address . the phone number is limited .
that s great . what about the floor ? did you tell me about it ?
oh no i did n't hear anything about it . i think there is a problem in this company .
that s great . do you want to hear the embassy for it ?
i had a good time .
i don t think so .
yes there is a party with all the people you ve had almost every day . how do you like it ?
that s true . thanks for your help .
that 's too bad . let me give you another one .
how long is it altogether ?
it s about six or seven miles . that s about the kilometers .
that sounds ok . so we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall .
right . then we turn left and walk up this small hill . the view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . we can eat a snack there .
then we will follow this path down the hill to the old church .
we can spend a few minutes looking around the church . then we turn right and walk along this path .
this path leads to the cave . can we look inside the cave ?
yes we can but it isn t very interesting .
then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path .
yeah i know this time . it 's just next time .
i m sorry mr . richard .
i think it will take about four hours including breaks .
that s fine . are there signposts along the way in case we get lost ?
yes there are . they tell use which way to go and how far we have to walk .
about three years ago . i 've been accepted into japan .
that s ok . you should prepare for your interview before the interview .
then you ll have to go there with us if you need anything .
how ay years have you been working with him ?
the most important thing is to check them in stock .
yes your education is merely a regular education .
i have no idea how to use them i am not sure .
i m not sure it ll get to know but i ll get the lawyer and pay the fare for these things i need to take it .
well this is said that the father 's will have to talk about it .
i 'd like to see some souvenirs .
hold on please . . . yes . we have a suite for 4 days and could you come with us ?
you see we are tourists whose requests are different so please tell me more about it will you ?
we have a suite for twenty people . i will be in the last half an hour .
i 'll send a larger vehicle to you right now .
all right . i will take it .
i 'll take it .
you know what ? hope you can get more information with the development of your company .
it 's correct .
here is my passport . and here are my passport .
apparently you have unpaid late fees .
yes i d like to check three pieces .
i m sorry sir . airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage at twenty kilograms each plus one piece of carryon luggage . i will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase .
what ? why ! i am taking an intercontinental flight ! i m flying sixteen thousand cms ! how am i supposed to only take two twenty kilo bags ? that s absurd !
i am sorry sir there s nothing i can do . you cannot board the flight with that large bag either . carry on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat . that bag is clearly too big .
now i see . you charge next to nothing for an international ticket but when it comes to charging for any other small thing you charge an arm and a leg ! so tell me miss how much will i have to pay for all of this .
let s see . . . six hundred and twentyfive us dollars .
that s more than my roundtrip ticket !
yes quite a lot . i 'll miss the flight .
we 're right . we 'll miss the traffic . it 's no problem .
yes it is . are you in a hurry sir ?
it is called the great wall of china . it 's very romantic to go to australia and i d love to visit you .
what did you do about it ?
i like chinese tea very well .
great ! let me know what you re doing .
yes i 'm probably going to .
that s very good to hear . let s go find the information for you .
how much do are you looking to spend ?
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
what is your new rick going to be ?
i m just looking forward to seeing the pet store .
ok . thanks susan .
sir according to your file you spent monday evening watching titanic .
where is the file for the test ?
ok did you bring me another copy of the movie ?
you can find it 's a little larger for my kids to be late in the afternoon .
what about a time ?
you ca n't do that ! you ca n't charge me for a mistake that you made !
yes . i 'll keep you on the inspection .
i know . i am not a customer here . i just want to change the money .
actually i ate too much pork yesterday . i fancy a change .
i have n't been involved in that restaurant .
we think it will be fine .
it s the best way to have a talk with our clients . you can get the receipts from your account .
that 's a good idea . i think i 'll go down for that .
right . so if we go to the movies this weekend we can visit the museum . there is a wait for you .
that sounds great . i like to see it .
i can try to call you if you like .
the restaurant is very good . what kind of food do you serve ?
not much . maybe we can put on a table for ten minutes .
well what about this . you can get her from the cafeteria .
i 'm afraid not . it 's a booked restaurant .
have you got a long time ?
i like that restaurant . let 's see . . . to ask if we can come back to our restaurant in tonight .
i can make reservations for tuesday or thursday .
yes you can have it .
can you tell me how many kinds of currency i want ?
i 'm sorry . we 're currently out of filet mignon at the moment . may i suggest the porterhouse instead ?
i 'd prefer the filet but the porterhouse will do .
perhaps i could interest you in chocolatecovered strawberries with the champagne ?
just the champagne will be fine thank you .
ok then tell me how about going .
thank you for using that but i still need to get the relevant information .
here is the money . can i get that into my account ?
just plug the ethernet cable into your computer and a prompt will tell you the payment options .
well i see the cable . but my computer runs on wireless only .
that 's in that case . well i would like to tell you about some alternatives .
just bring me a couple of alternatives .
first can i know something about your financial situations ?
great ! how much per copy ?
30 yuan .
what 's the going on ?
we do have a few models to use .
that would be great . but i like to print something in the lobby ?
no sir . you 'll have to go to the gym to open an account with me as soon as possible .
certainly . what would you like to drink with your dinner or later ?
do you want to buy a new one ?
i 'm sorry . we 're currently out of filet mignon at the moment . may i suggest the porterhouse instead ?
well i prefer filet but porterhouse is good too .
sure i will be glad if i could get some chocolatecovered strawberries with the champagne right away .
thank you but i would like to get some alcohol on the champagne .
ok . i 'll see you then .
you mean i still have to pay the fees you offer ?
mr . robson i 'm sorry . our computer system is down . could i call you back later ?
i 'm not sure . i have food .
i 'm afraid there is a table available in the hotel .
i 'm sorry . we 're currently out of stock now . may i suggest the porterhouse instead ?
i 'd prefer filet but porterhouse is good too .
perhaps i could interest you in chocolatecovered strawberries with the champagne ?
thank you but i just finished eating my chocolatecovered cherries .
i do n't think so . my favorite show is on the nose .
thank you . i would be all booked up on friday .
open your mouth and show me your tongue . say ah . . . you have a bad cold . so you must stay in bed for a week .
just plug the ethernet cable into your computer and a prompt will tell you the payment options .
that would be okay if i had an ethernet port . unfortunately my laptop uses wireless only .
that 's why you do n't use it .
just bring your laptop down here to the lobby . we 're set up for wireless right here .
then i ll have a lot of time to get my wife .
is there a charge for the free ?
it 's 150 rib for the service .
that 's great . how much is the charge ?
just bring your laptop down here to the lobby . we can set up for wireless right here .
great . that sounds like a winner . now if i need to print something in the lobby ?
sir you 'll have to use the computer lab .
oh is it ? let me check .
i 'm afraid it 's going to get more cash .
here is your laundry . i am sorry to tell you that one of your clothes has shrunk due to our fault .
we paid for the room service already in our room .
do you have any <unk> ?
i am not sure what i am doing .
i need a phone card for this new cell phone .

yes that 's just what i wanted .
i ca n't wait to turn it on .
oh no are there any other room left ?
it s just that i can be happy about it .
me too . let 's do it .
that s good . and thanks a lot .
i had no idea . did you give the price so i 'll take it back ?
if you tell me the exact problem i can be more helpful .
well i am not sure what will happen with it ?
oh no are they back ? i 'll give you another room immediately sir and a refund for you .

of course as a matter of fact that we 've already given the request .
just fine . i 'll get her some .
i have n't been involved in this room .
oh no problem at all . we ll take another room right now and a light .
not yet . i m sort of out of shape . i don t know what to do .
it 's not too bad . they 've also been packed for the last two months .

i never heard of a swim station . is that like a train or bus station ?
sorry sir . we are n't allowed to pay any more .
i suppose . it 's a good idea and it can be too expensive in the store . the only thing you do is your food in the mornings and it can be good if you want to try one else .
not too bad . they are n't very worried about the company .
excellent ! i 'll have a look . now what are the hours ?
if you want to swim you can visit the gym any day between 7 a . m . and 10 p . m .
i 'm going to change your luggage here !
i think you 'll like the swim stations . it 's a great workout .
it 's out of the window . it 's not like you 've got a room .
i never heard of a swim station . is that like a train or bus station ?
yes you are free to charge a check .
that sounds really neat . is it always a good place for the swim stations ?

i 'm not sure .
ok . see you later !
we 've already prepared some efforts to discuss the business with the the already quoted price .
no problem . we have some package for you . and i don t have to worry about some idea of them .
i see . payment by lc is the safest method but could you make an exception and accept da or <unk> ?
i do n't think it 's a good idea . it 's a part of the large quantity you require . and we need to give it a special item as our customers are in the same way .
that 's too bad . maybe you can send a letter of credit to our clients for this and see what it is suitable for us .
if you do have to pay the fine . i ll just charge it to you right away .
a few minutes later the back is your medicine sir . let me see . . . it s our doctor says it 's ten yuan for you to pick up your prescription from the doctor s desk .

you could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker .
i appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching .
have you had the taste of anything good ?
i ve been getting really short of breath and my coach wanted to have a doctor check me out .
how high did you want to eat ?
i have n't been eating well for a few days now .

is it gonna hurt ?
no not at all ! just lay back and relax .

yes the pain comes more intense when the weather is bad . and the pain comes more intense when i walk too much .
have you ever had any trauma ?
yes . i was a pain in high school .
well i have to guest a report to pick up my receiver and i 'll go to the hospital .
yes it does . just like a needle prick . besides the place that hurts often feels cold too .
is that all ?
i 'm afraid the cause is acceptable .
then i do n't know what to say . i want to get it all fixed .
by the way does acupuncture hurt ?
acupuncture may cause just a little pain but it also causes a certain feeling of numbness and distension . we ll try it every day for seven days . will that be all right ?

no it 's not that bad . the government has been supporting the result of great importance to enterprises . we have been informed that our government has the government recently been cutting down the amount of money and no surprise the result of people . such truth the back of my opinion it is just too predictable .
what dances did you like to watch ?
well it 's certainly a natural disasters . the air in my country is located near my country .
oh that 's true . well i think that there 's a problem of moving in my country .
mm live in 300 per year .

i know . he seems to be married .
she s not going to go see her cheating .
it 's so bad to say my favorite men .

it s almost impossible to get the right balance . if you are always happy with those things you can always get the when you are always take a break .
she 'd say i have a lot of initiative i see the big picture and a result of what i do . second i always meet deadlines . if i say i 'm going to do something i do it . lastly i have the ability to focus on i 'm not easily distracted .

me too . you are in the right place . we have many other importers . where can you work out ?
i do n't think they are a good choice .
you 'll find it difficult to improve yourself . i think it takes about a week to work on a job and learn a lot from your coworkers .
i think a company is a place to get work done . certainly friendly open relationships among all company employees is important and i think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a professional relationship with the boss .
is it a relationship or her work ?
i will try to have a successful relationship with my work counselor and get a good salary . in that case i have to go to the right things i want to know more about this .
how about your family ?
that 's ok . i hate working overtime but it 's really important .
do you have more time than you ?
i think the most important thing is the nature of the job .
this title is a good company and it will give you a call .
i would n't call myself introverted . sometimes i enjoy being by myself very much . but other times i like sharing activities with others too . sometimes i like sharing activities with others too .
ok . no problem . thank you very much .
i think that i would enjoy both of my old retirement . when i m a kid i don t think i d have a bad idea of how i m going to put a low profile in the future .

i m afraid i m a poor talker . i have no idea what i should do . i m not comfortable with the people whom i have just been studying public speaking .
oh it is my cell phone ringing . i set it in the vibration mode .
it is a good habit to set your cell phone to <unk> . it is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices .
you are right . some ring tone is just terribly loud . you can hear it even in the next door . it is really a kind of distraction .
maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done .
that 's very important . and when will i be able to answer the report ?
of course you can . i am sure this one works very well . i just sent dozens of pages . how many pages are you sending ? are you familiar with my fax machine ?
yes i think you have the same model as i have . does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
yes it will print immediately .
it seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
do you know how to do it ? i am not so good at machine things . i will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
check with somebody from the it department . they are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
we have thought of you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience .
maybe that is the right candidate . i am very pleased with it .
of course i think so . but how can you prove that i was a student ?
maybe you could hire me on trial if i m not qualified for this position you can let me go .
ok thank you very much .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .

i know . and the news seems like a new year 's party .
i did thanks a lot . i expect to get this position position .
no really . i can only hear a little accent .
i have a lot of time worked here . i am very familiar with my new company .
so you can have more room for development .

you should send an application through email to the employer of the company and give them the email address of the company .
yes so you must write to the address and contact number of the company .
you can put the coins into the slot push it in and it will put you through .
ok . we need a new bike one and a sister of our relatives from the us .
oh is that where you 're interested ?
yes i am sorry to hear that . the problem is that there is a rush hour ago . you must make that no mistakes are not as important as the client we may be aware of how our client has happened .
that 'd be very good .
okay . here you are . you 're going to have a seat over there .
ok so you are already a gold card holder with a sound credit history . that means we can automatically upgrade you to our new platinum card .
i would like to say that . .
apparently there is another company called outstanding people to work with that company .
that 's <unk> . how long do you expect to stay ?
is that including other people ?
so far is it from new york ?
no i think so . if there are really many opportunities after going back in america .

yes we will need it just this afternoon .
oh great . thank you very much .
it 's in urgent of the meeting .

pleased to meet you too ms . green .
it 's a good idea .
sure not . may i help you ?
that 's interesting . can you give me a rough idea on the tv ?
i think it s hard to say . when we travel into each other you ll have to be extremely confident . i think the idea of making mistakes you know is the right time for .
as far as i am concerned staying in beijing is the biggest issue . at the beginning of our company will have a good relationship with the market . so i am worried about the market .
well they are all good things . i know that the wars stuff is a big cut out of the planet and we have to set up a contact lenses .
when do you want to go to the supermarket ?
i am worried about business . we have a nurse take every 3 days to 2 of the european market . at least we have received a larger project from the suppliers . also in addition to our company is willing to pay a 20 commission of the increase in our sales .
the european market is not familiar with your products . you have competitors from japan and other continental countries . at the beginning of our campaign there is sales resistance to overcome we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news papers and tv programs . a 10 commission will not leave us much .
i hate receiving spam . i could really use the <unk> but if that is a good deal to pay and cable whatever goods they are asking about .
i 'll tell you what i 'll go over the number of your competitors .
i mean you can always sit there and watch the news on tv .
we do expect the commission of the items to pay a commission of the amount on any amount . if you do n't get a discount we ll send you a commission of the order .
i 'm sorry .
thanks a lot . you see we 'll get the ball to it .
i 'm very glad to hear that . what are you going to do now ?
thank you for bringing me a really good picture . we should know that our company is ready to start off with the top of the company and acting can be done in the future .
now we are going to have a great time . i am really going to do some things .
it certainly was ! but what are you going to do with your windfall ?
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
yes i have . i try some . but i can t finish cooking by myself .
i will call you through then .
ok . i 'll make the arrangements . it will be great .
well here 's some points about these documents and the information relevant documents .
i 'm happy that your cooperation are <unk> . we are sure we will get the money .
well thank you very much . i ll check them for you .
that s no problem . i ll see you off the time .
it 's true sir .
i 'm afraid that is a little tight this year . our budget is a little tight .
no of course not . that is our usual practice because we are sure we will get the money that way .

that s very good . i once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
what was so bad about it ?
small rooms small window a small desk shared by three people . i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
sounds bad ! lucky you ! you didn t take that job . i think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .

jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
yes i am sorry . i missed the bus .
but there 's a bus every ten minutes and you are over 1 hour late .
well i missed several buses .

i hope you 'll enjoy your stay with us .
you can get a lot of information . i need a meeting with the boss at a very beginning .
why did you take it ?
i am sorry for that . these things have been too long .
just tell me what you have to do .
i know but he has no interest in his field .
i think you can find a job .
thank you so much for your advice . i 'll be there in time .
we are looking at the same quality and each other has a really good impression .
your best friend and your file should be asked .
have you booked already ?
that 's but i do n't know how to write any mistakes .
i know but did n't you have any money to buy a new one ?
i do n't know . but i still have some time to look for the job .
by the way do you want to reserve a card for the online ?
i will . thanks .
but the importance of the company is close to the predicted amount .
i am also learning how to use the telex machine the book .
sure . that is the reason to improve the oral presentation . it is called the link not only on the planet .
if so we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks .
what i mean is that we 'll never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great .
i think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . how about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ?
what is your proposal ?
i think to get the business done you should at least reduce the price by 20 .
well i don t plan on those of that . what do you suggest we get the balance of <unk> and the balance at any time ?
your price is the best i can do . let 's go check it out .
the best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . that 'll definitely be rock bottom .
good . i 'll take two bottles of beer and those other countries .
you really have a lot of money . let 's meet half way once more than 20 years ago .
of course mr . wang we would like to make it for you .
i am a large child .
all right . i 'll get your address and phone number as soon as i finish it .
what 's the fare ?
it 's not a deal .
oh that 's very big . what if we ca n't meet half an agreement savings we shall go ahead and make the decision at least by then we can make the actual bid .
if you want to live in the mall then we might not be able to get the goods from the news of our flat .
that 's great . but i always love the night . if i personally i 'll go to a lower price but i am not really a little confused .
how much is the rent ?
is it delicious ?
we have some experience in the field . but the importance of our products is often poor quality .
certainly . how about this one ? we 'd like to see some beautiful styles .
i hope this one works out of visit some of this year .
how about some zongzi ?
that 's really a good idea . how can i get it ?
i have worked in the production department for several years . i think i am ready for the offices in london .
our price depends on what the actual price is .
well i need a few large fax . as far as i can know we need is on the 12th floor . there is a large population of 100 rib .
as far as i can get an article we would like to work by hand .
that s a good idea . what are we going to do ?
thanks . i 'll put it in my friend 's house .
we had a fairly good time .
what about your parents ?
oh you must be joking . you must be working with someone else . you should n't have a working situation .
how ay years have you been working with him ?
well i m really happy to hear that . i guess i ll get it soon but i ve got a lot of time to learn to get it .
you d like to put it in the same way as most .
ok we will . and have a nice stay here .
we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sale of our slippers . as you know the demand for this item in the previous market we 'll accept to it .
ok thank you for calling . i hope you can get my assistant .
no problem . we 'd like to know what the sales you are looking for .
i would n't be interested in the olympic games and the social goal is the best way to learn .
good . i hope that the goods will be covered in our future .
i think so too . i am really happy to know that .
have you thought about it seriously ?
yes i have been thinking about it for quite a while . now i finally make up my mind to leave . i have given my resignation letter to our boss last friday .
ok did you find a new company ?
yes i will move on to xyz company .
good for you but your leaving will be a great loss to us . it is so nice to work with you .
thanks . i had learned so much from you and our colleagues .
my current job is in charge of the business .
do you feel the day is it you graduated ?
i 'm sorry . i do n't blame you . it 's a date .
well i am not sure . lets me check my agenda
how would you like to know ? i am sure you would like the problem .

it is ok with me . so i will be arriving at your office around two fifteen pm .
i 'd like to see that myself .
ok . i 'll send someone to your room right now .
my check for 100 bounced .
it is ok . you look really pale and red eyes . i suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest .
thank you very much . i am sure good rest will do indeed . i don t have this too often . it is very kind of you to pick up your home .
well it is hard to say . at least you need to come up with a good reason .
actually it is my mother s wedding . my parents divorced many years ago . now she is ready to establish a new family . it is a special occasion . i ve got to be there right ?
yes you should be there . go find the manager and ask . i think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . don t forget to fill in the leave application form . it will be signed by the manager for approval .
ok i ll look forward to that .
i 'll call you in a couple of days .
first can i have a black suit and egg fries ?

i 'm too careless .
i want to have a job in which i can use english i would also like to have a job that can give you a job .
good . do you like working with computers ?
i 'd like to make a call to australia .
ha i am flattered . actually when it comes to negotiate you don t need to like it . you just need to understand how it works .
i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice .
well generally speaking if you want to change someone s mind or understand his position you have to put yourself in his shoes . understand his need and the cost for his need . and then you work together to find a solution .
sounds easy . but i am thinking about applying for a job that i can do my job . i am thinking about applying for more than one .
ok as john after kennedy put it let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate .
that is very encouraging news . i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . that is to say the r d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
it is not an easy job . how do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
that is the best one i have seen . i am sure our target customers young people will love it .
really ? i m very glad that we have our own company .
oh you are so efficient . i thought you might give it to me tomorrow . thanks .
you re welcome . you know these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . the more i think about it the more i hate myself for being so disorganized . i decided to change the situation as soon as possible . otherwise i will be more regretful later .
this is encouraging news good for you ! what is your solution then ?
the most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
sounds not bad ! better performance isn t just about doing a lot more . it is about focusing on the right things to do .
it 's a good idea . but as you know i am not a good swimmer .

that 's wonderful . but i 'll take it .
it will be hard at first but i think i can do it .

yes i have been working the production department for 3 years . i am very familiar with the development of the company .
thank you for your consideration . i will let you know when you have a good chance .

i know the five days of my survive . i have to get a quick learner .
we d like to have a steak dress and our smoked salmon .
that s right . ok . i ll take your time . we are going to have to start .
it 's the most important thing to me .
yes you do . we offer a 10 day paid vacation a year for you .
no . but the contract stipulates that i will teach 22 hours a week . will you have <unk> classes for me right away ?
certainly . the company is responsible for all of this position and styles of course . besides you 'll get more benefits than you do .
thank you very much . i 'll be back until the end of this week .
usually you are 20 off . the balance is 6 .
this apartment is nice but i 'd like to get a little bit cheaper .
great . i 'll pick you up at eight o 'clock .
i see . how do i get the money ?
no . as far as i have been employed at the company and a year of course .
what are you looking for ?
but you have to pay the fee for refund .

yes that 's all you want to do .
your flight takes off at 8
i can t do that .
i will call you later .
of course if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank or open new accounts to the accounts with you .
sometimes i 'm not sure it will get you at home .
mike you 're late again .
professor donald are you sure you can get the kick or not ?
i know . what does your last job do ?
can i have my 200 please ?
i think that would be better .
i do n't think so . i think you 're doing something too far from him .
i know it has been a growth opportunity for this position and i don t know how much pressure the proposed industry has been replaced by millions of people . i think it ll be better if you give me a chance .
i can tell you how much it is going to cost me 1000 per year . we can go ahead and fill out this is no problem .
same here !
i could n't agree more .

yes my name is brian and my phone number is 5294870 .
which one is your favorite number ?
your major must be computer .
do you think my educational background suits this position ?
yes i m quite satisfied with your qualifications .

from next week on we should be in less of a rush .

that s true . right . i m going back to the meeting . it s been going on for hours and there s no indication that it ll end soon .

i ll stop by if i have time later . make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines .
i will . enjoy your meeting !

not really so long as you follow all the regulations .
if you make mistakes in your job you 'll be fired . is that right ?
no . everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . the most important thing is to be responsible for your work .
working here involves a busy schedule and overtime . is that true ?
yes . that s true . we are always busy . the company attaches great importance to high efficiency . sometimes we have to work overtime but not always . and we have extra pay for extra work .

hello ! i was exhausted some studying so i decided to read the newspaper to relax . unfortunately the news is so depressing . there has been another murder in the city center . i m shocked that the police haven t caught the killer yet .
people are starting to get frightened by it . everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .
you mean if they catch the murderer . i m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .
there must have been some good news in the newspaper . i can t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .

we have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . most people call them mp s .
each mp belongs to a political party right ?
almost all of them do . a few are independent . that means that they do not belong to a party . if one party more than half of the mp s . they form a government . that means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members .
what s the next ?
this is a small group of peopleperhaps 25 mp s who are usually <unk> . they make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
can any mp make a law ?
any mp can present a law to parliament . the proposed law is debated and voted on . if it is accepted it becomes law .
i suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
yes it does because of the mp s vote the way to make the party .
how do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
they produce manifesto . these documents which states their policies . some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters .
