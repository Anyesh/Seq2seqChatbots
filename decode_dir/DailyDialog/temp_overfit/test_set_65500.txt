well it 's probably nothing serious . but i think we 'd better have that shoulder xrayed . we ca n't do the until the morning though . so it 'd be better if you stay in hospital for the night
that 's for the breakfast you ordered from the hotel .
oh i have to check . do you need anything else ?
no i just need the sheets .
that will be fourteen dollars in all .
i 'm sorry .
let me see . that 's the only thing i can do .
i 'm sorry to have bothered you .
sorry . you should go to the front desk first .
are you kidding me ? it was quite a long time .
well what else do you want ?
i 'd just like to trim . don t cut too short .
yes sir . how about the sides ?
i think they need a little trimming .
can i use the <unk> ?
no don t use them please .
very good sir .
i 'm afraid there has been a mistake .
no . it depends on the amount and distance you 'll have to be able to follow the back of your instructions .
yes madam . i think we should go to the front desk first .
ok let 's go .
yes they will be ready this afternoon .
oh i see .
yes . but my beard is rough .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
here you are . seventyfive cent please .
and please sent this letter by registered mail .
is there anything valuable in it ?
there s a check of two hundred dollars and photograph .
shall i make out a receipt ?
no . don t bother .
do you have anything to declare ?
i see . he is just an excuse for him to give you the right person .
good idea . i 'll have a cup of tea instead .
how about milan ?
yes could you let me get you a pair ?
i want to buy some things .
do you know what kind of shoes you want ?
medium i think .
may i see your receipt ?
here is my receipt .
thank you . how much is it ?
do you realize that these shoes are half off ?
yes here you are .
thank you . how much is it ?
what 's the difference ?
yes . what is your size ?
sure . and i 'll lend you some back .
yes . i would like to cash my travelers check . here you are .
for how long ?
yes here you are .
is it expensive ?
i think the only reason is that i am going to be expected to learn after the meeting .
go and get it out .
i do n't understand .
i 'm going to go get a pair for myself .
then how about a quality of the shirts ?
i see . what are you doing in your position ?
well i hope you can make it .
no i 'm afraid not . my manager is very ill and i 'm very worried about his work .
i guess we will . . .
i 'm afraid that we 've already spent a little on our project . i 'd like to have some delicious dishes if you 'd like .
here is my receipt .
thank you . how much is it ?
really ? let 's just go . i 'd like to think about this one .
there 's a problem .
better take the subway . it 's faster .
my wife want to go shopping for us .
we have a rather comprehensive subway system here . you can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy .
where do we pay the fare ?
just give the man sitting there three yuan and he 'll give you a ticket .
oh i see . by the way how can i get out of the platform after i get off the train ?
tell me where you live .
where 's the museum ?
no you don t have to . here comes the train . be careful ! subway doors open and close automatically .
this is the east market to central park bus . where do you want to go ?
to the <unk> government hall .
i m glad that they were happy .
oh good . thank you .
yes here you are .
i will give you a ticket .
well i hope you can give me the receipt .
well that depends . if the bus is n't too late they will give you a discount .
it is twoyear and covers parts and service .
i can agree with you .
i will give it a try .
great . thanks for everything .
yes i need some help with them . we also need some washing machines in boxes .
it depends on how you want to travel .
oh okay . that 's a bit expensive .
no . we can only take small handbag and a large sum of money .
i know and they are really nice too .
i ll have to get a couple in different colors .
i can help you with that .
i ca n't stand the loud noise in the city .
good idea especially at this price .
the small one can i try them on ?
thanks . i will take them .
yes . and there are meals that are free of charge .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
no . this is not mine .
the total amount is <unk> .
here is my member card . can i have someone carry those bags to my car ?
no . you can only pay by credit card .
ok . here 's my visa .
do you want to buy the ticket ?
ca n't we ? that 's it . i 'll be mad if i can get it .
what 's the tour time ?
certainly sir .
i 'll take it .
oh . all right i 'll read it soon .
okay then let s see .
yes i like coffee .
but we have a lot of special english shoes .
i have n't decided yet . can you recommend something ?
i would like that . i do n't know what to order .
i like it so far . but my english still needs work .
i see . we have three kinds of dressings for salad . italian french and thousand island . which one would you like ?
can you deliver the balance at the earliest possible date ?
no problem . how long would you like it to be delivered in four years ?
yes . i 'd like to change some money to cover my expenses here . what 's today 's rate of us dollar against the rib yuan ?
of course if you had a major credit with us we would like to keep you waiting for the new project .
yes here you are .
i just got two tickets .
do you need a hand with that ?
read me the index number !
i have no reason to explain it .
that s what you said just now . how many miles are you going to get married ?
because the earth 's environment ca n't tolerate cars forever . i think cars are already causing global warming . when the problem gets more serious world governments will have to start limiting car use .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that 's not fair . so how can we get out of the same stage ?
oh my god ! your secretary is so deep !
yes i think i 've heard that .
i see . well it 's nothing serious . let me have that .
that s all right . i m going to go home .
i will . don t worry i m fine .
i know . it s ok .
it may be true but i think they are getting married this summer .
you 're welcome . have a nice day !
i m interested in renting a newspaper .
sure . what is it ?
and about time too .
the ad says 325 plus deposit .
would you please reconsider ?
yes . it includes electricity water gas and cable but the telephone is extra .
i want to post it to get my carpet .
it s on the second floor .
i ll be there in a minute .
well i ve got a fever and a bad one for my brother . he s got blue cross .
well i think i can afford the apartment right now .
i think it 's because of your bad habits !
in my country i didn t know ! that s a lot of fun !
the picture of the author 's name is determined by the company .
yes i have a room for three people .
i m starving too . what do we do there ?
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
that s what i charge .
so you can t be happy with it ! where are you going ?
yes . my contract says that i should be in a bank s account at the end of this month .
oh my poor danny sure you are a man . but you know running like this in street is very dangerous .
ok . when is the men's room open ?
that sounds good .
i was busy all the time . what a nice neighborhood !
i 'm sorry to say that we have to let you go john .
my pleasure . i 'd like to invite you to dinner next time .
yes . i bet my bottom dollar that he will be in a bit .
do you play any sports or games ?
i 'm very sorry . sir . i 'll ask the manager to take care of this .
sure . what can i do for you ?
i think you can give me some advice . you have worked here longer and i just want to know what you think .
sorry to hear that . i 'll have to examine you .
thanks . i 'm going to do that .
yes sure . go ahead .
oh it is not easy to learn !
well the only thing is to be done is to be familiar with the insurance industry and i think it 's about some of the quality .
how long will it take for my new apartment to be ready to start ?

my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
and what is your last name ?
you must be joking . those are beautiful .

i know that . but i like playing the piano .
then he might make a face . one more question .
i agree with you but you know it 's hard to say .
it 's just a basketball game .
he 's a famous american musician .
you 're so lucky .
who 's she then ?
my name is bill . how are you going ?
he 's a very serious person .
he 's a small blue nissan minivan .
you 're right . he 's so nice and famous .
well i 'm glad to hear that he 's doing well .
that 's a notebook ?
it 's amazing .
i went to the cafeteria and found out that she was n't too excited to give me her parents a hand .
i do n't think so . i 've been following her around campus and i 'm sure you will have the job .
because you can see the stars perfectly .
i hope so .
yes sir . can i have your name please ?
not bad . i finally got my final exam .
you 're welcome . i hope you 'll be more comfortable in your new room .

i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . jones needs a telephone call from you .
i 'm sorry . i do n't think so . you 'll have to call your mother .
please go to the front desk over there .
which one ?
this one ?
oh dear .
no thanks . i 've already got some vegetables .
tell me about it .
you 'd better call your friend if you 'd like .
are they sweet ?
it 's not far away from here .
you will have to wait a minute .
i want you to cook something .
how about a snack after work ?
the <unk> thing is n't it ?
do you want me to put the suitcase on the scales ? you look so concerned .
just go !
i guess so . it 's difficult to say .
what color do you want ?
well brown .
look ! there 's a folk concert tomorrow evening . do you want to go ?
oh no .
size 24 .
ok . let me see . . . six hundred and fifty us dollars . that 's the best we can do .
the dress is slim in cut .
well honestly speaking i went to watch it out of curiosity . i 'd say it 's really a special art form .
yes . i 'm going to take it .
yes . let me help you .
that 's good . i think i 'll take it .
it s 100 cotton .
that 's good . can you give me a reduction ?
yes . i have my wallet stolen .
anything you like . blue ?
oh i like it very much . can i try it on ?
of course . i will show you the fitting room .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
yes i have . i think it 's much better than the bus .
do you have any style in your mind ?
is there anything you would like ?
rhaki . do you want some ?
that is a good idea . it is really impressive with some information on you might like .
i think of two people . but i know how to surround a larger area than the opponent . in fact i am a big fan of both chinese and italian restaurants .
i do n't believe my turn . it 's a perfect match .
he 's really pretty cute .
yup .
i wonder if he can come to see me .
sorry sir but we ca n't do it . he 's not in the mood to help us .
oh hi andy . i 'm back from the city of the town .
i was just thinking about someone i went to school with this boy i was quite friendly with in third grade . we used to hang out together he lived next door but then my parents moved and i changed schools and never saw him again .
you 're not late . the shop is right over there .
they are all right . they are all handmade girl . you know the young girls in china are so dark i wish to be quiet .
yes it is . the washing machine is in there .
what 's the place you need to go to ?
i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . jones needs a telephone call from you .
what 's the exact time ?
oh yes . why do n't you get a new one ?
here is my ticket . can i buy one ?
the next bus will be here in four minutes .
you 're right . everything is probably going to come to a head tonight .
i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . jones needs a telephone call from you .
no it 's not . i just have to follow the instructions . it will be a hard time .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'll be late for school tomorrow .
the problem is that the people 's illegal drugs and the problem are complete and that might be illegal in the past . the police have to find evidence that people who have the proper evidence . there 's no activity for them to write their input .
really ? how did you feel when you came home ?
but we are working on it . can we do something else ?
i know but i 'm really tired .
my mom just wants everything to be perfect for us .
no they are n't . i 'm sure they 'll be pleased .
i 'm not in the mood for it .
do n't worry about it .
what about the jeans ? they are not so cheap .
what does the benefits package include ?
chicken ! i thought that was a fantastic meat .
you said you were only going to window shop !
she only costs one for twenty dollars .
but we have to be so critical of her !
that 's right . what do you think about it ?
you 've got a point there . it 's a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit . there is no need to ask if he needs it or not or if he wants something else . it might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea .
yes i did . did you get a ba in english ?
cool down harry ! what are you really mad about ? did you get ripped off ?
yes . last sunday i went to a nearby market . it was on <unk> fair . i chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot without even trying to strike a bargain . i paid one hundred and twenty . and twenty . and just
is that so ? i 'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . it 's the norm of free trade . the seller sets
but do n't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?
of course that 's something really irritation . and the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . i recommend you to consult the price tags in the superb
you 're kidding !
i hope i will stay up soon . i 'm really tired .
yes we do . my mom and i can t eat anything .
and eggs ?
i have the same feeling .
i go to bed at ten and get up at six .
that 's helpful for your health .
i think i 'm ready for the job .
yes i am . i have n't received any training in the american department .
really ? does mary know that ?
ok the total would be 367 and 65 cents . how would you pay ?
ok . how about some fish then ?
yes i think so . the weather should be good . i have a warm evening . where are you going ?
ok .
who s calling ?
yes please tell her that band practice has been moved to tuesday night at eight thirty .
that s for sure . you ll know our products better after the visit .
sixty dollars .
i want some air .
yes we have both the same color in your size .
would you mind if i helped out in the kitchen instead ? i do enjoy cooking .
this is supposed to be your vacation we 'd like you to just relax .
cooking makes me feel relaxed . so what are we cooking ?
ok well we 're going to make a pan of lasagne a salad and some garlic bread . here 's the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?
sure . we should probably preheat the oven right away too .
that 's a good idea . can you set the oven to 200 degrees celsius ?
that 's a bit high for lasagne . i 'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there .
fine . i 'll just get out the casserole dish the <unk> the <unk> the salad bowl and the baking sheet .
you know i could do this myself . why do n't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ?
i do n't think it 's broken .
sorry about your arm but it 's your right .
fine . i 'll go vacuum . let me know if you need any other help .
yes go along queen's road . . .
i am sure my friend can give you a ride .
you can find it at first .
okay . i 'm finished . here 's your form and label .
i 'll call the police immediately sir .
thanks i 'll see you around seven .
well it 's a fortyfive minute to an hour ride .
and what 's this amount for ?
you 're welcome . i hope you 'll be more comfortable in your new room .
of course . is the dinner still on ?
yes i was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .
we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .
that 's what i thought you would do . listen i live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . it 's just down the street from all the bars . you probably do n't want to be walking around after dark .
it ca n't be that bad .
but it is ! take this morning for example . the subway was so packed this morning i got totally squished by about a hundred busy <unk> on the way to work .
really ? i never would have guessed . the criminals must only come out in the evenings because i 've never noticed anything strange when i 've been at your house in the daytime .
do me a favor and take a taxi . it 'd make me feel a lot better .
ok we will . how do you get around in the evenings ?
when i first moved in i walked everywhere . but within a week i had my purse stolen just a block away from the police station ! now i always take public transportation .
let 's take a look at the police . that 's where the problem is .
nothing else has happened to me but i have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close .
well we 'll be careful . thanks for letting me know .
i m sorry i m not in the mood for this . can you help me ?
are there many accidents in the city every day ?
do n't worry . we 'll always be careful .
what are the symptoms ?
wow . look any rain right now .
it s cheaper isn t it ?
did you work as a salesperson before mrs . vale ?
my roommate always brings a lot of friends from <unk> .
i am but i am thinking of you .
well the necklace is longer than in the box . how about 10 minutes ?
that s too bad . have you been one to the beach very long ?
i 'm sorry to hear that .
that 's the place where people wanted to go to the party .
please be seated . the police will be here in about 30 minutes .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you . i do n't think i 've got anything serious in the kitchen .
i guess they 're so violent . but my friends are even disgusting .
yes . what 's your flight number ?
yes sir . where to ?
all right . how long will you be staying ?
i am sure you like it .
i can t think of anything .
oh my god !
no problem . do n't worry the taxi is faster than the bus .
is the rush hour ?
you know i hate shopping more than anything else in this world .
i know . but we could get some exercise in and we could get some exercise in . and we could get some errands run too . windowshopping won t be able to start .
what kind of errands do we need to run ?
well we could go to the newsagent s to pick up the sunday paper go to the butcher s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner and to the chemist s to pick up your prescription from the doctor .
i 'll only go if we can stop at the <unk> to pick up something to drink for tonight .
fine we 'll be waiting .
sounds good . are you interested in going to school tomorrow ?
i promise . we re only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven t had time for .
ok let 's go then .
at the zoo wow ! this zoo is really huge .
no . we don t . i m going to put out anything in the car .
i need to pay my bills .
you said you were only going to window shop !
i agreed to not go into the mall but i can still look at things in the market !
i should have known . . .
it opens at 900 from april to october .
can we bring it back and i 'll be waiting for you .
it 's already 3 8 o 'clock .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one of your new computer here . it 's too noisy .
can you get you anything to drink ?
there 's quite a long list actually ! you can use if for business trip expenses medical expenses any internal payments .
what about some sugar ?
to go please .
do n't you want beef soup ?
wow ! it 's too big . i 'm going to be late .
it 's on the service counter over there . please go to help yourself .
fine with me but no more chafing dish .
let 's go to the food stall . there 's a good one just around the corner .
i 'd love to try some snacks .
later . everything looks tempting . what do you want to have ?
kebabs and roast squid .
can i have a bite ?
help yourself .
super !
to the right .
this is your luggage check which you must show when you disembark at your destination and here is your boarding pass and your ticket .
yes i 'll have a good eye to eye with you .
would you like a shave ?
yes . but my beard is rough .
well i hope you ll feel better soon .
you 're welcome !
really ? you are joking ?
no i 'd rather you did n't like it .
i 'd like that . alright put on this apron first .
ok so the first thing we are going to do is preheat the oven that way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing everything . set it to three hundred and seventy five degrees fahrenheit .
i know . . . well i still hate spending more time with my hands and he made a lot of money into me .
do you like it ?
no you do n't have to pay attention to your health . now let 's try and be careful .

what 's the point ?
could you take it to that counter please ?
i have a flat tyre .
we have a special on these skirts this week . would you like to try one on ?
no thank you . i do n't need any skirts .
how about a blouse ? this one here is the latest fashion .
it looks nice . how much is it ?
how about oil or spray ?
no doubt . look i 'm just browsing . if i need your help i 'll let you know .
take a look at this dress . do n't you think it 's perfect for you ma 'am ? uh where are you going ma 'am ? ma 'am ? ma 'am ?

you 're welcome goodbye .
well let 's try a size ten . he gets another pair and the customer tries a shoe on looks like a perfect fit .

thank you ma 'am . it 's been a pleasure doing business with you .
yes . i 'm looking for a cap . size 16 .
do you have any special brand in your mind ?
medium i think .
western food or chinese food ?
black is not my favorite colour .
we have a blue and blue cheese .
no this is the best thing i can do .
i guess . i 'm a diet .
oh these ? hmm . . . yellow is n't a good color for me .
yes of course . it s a big green room in the middle of the summer .
i see . what 's the tiananmen famous for ?
do you need a hand with that ?
yes . i would like to discuss with mr . nelson first . i think he will return to you .
what did you do in china ?
the number is <unk> 2 .
ok i 'll be right back .
i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . jones needs a telephone call from you .
i can have a try . please give me a glass of orange juice .
i m starving too . there is a new chinese restaurant close by . do you want to go there for lunch ?
in my opinion you should make an apology for losing your temper .
it s saturday a great weekend . it s so noisy that i can t work .
i m sorry to hear that .
you are ! how many nights will it be ?
pleasure . mr . lee we have prepared the appointment for you .
i 'm sorry that i could not find the way to get my assistant manager to know that i am going to have to pay for it .
why do you want to go to america ?
certainly . how many are you in your party ?
<unk> .
mr . luo will you hold the line please ?
hi john .
um yes i 'd like a medium size .
our name is area code is <unk> 2 .
sure . what 's up ?
hello . i m calling to invite mr . macmillan tomorrow . can you take a look at his book ?
wow like that . i 've seen you somewhere in that area .
i 'm at the post office .
why would you like to work with us ?
it 's a red building .
i m sorry . we do n't haven any .
what was the number ?
it 's still cheaper . can you give me a better price ?
what do you do if i put in my clothes ?
hi eric may i know your name ?
hold on please .
have you got a seat ?
no . i 'm sorry but we do n't use too long . you can wait till the last minute .
ok . thank you .
because i m not in the mood that s why .
well don t just sit there do something . come and help me in the kitchen .
help you in the kitchen i don t feel like it .
i ve been working too hard and i m not able to do something .
really ? do i have to do it ?
not if you don t want to .
really it 's so beautiful .
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
you must n't pick it in this place .
it 's very kind of you .
it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
yes ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
i do n't want to .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
and there 's another thing that i could take it home .
i bet you had a promotion this morning .
sorry i 'm very near sighted .
no i can not .
try to be more careful in future .
it was . and it looked fine .
if it 's a job that is available there .
i am not surprised you eat too much .
and i suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office does n't help .
no i would n't think so .
i do wish i could lose weight .
well why do n't you go on the diet ?
i 've tried diets before but they 've never worked .
perhaps you should exercise more . why do n't you go to an exercise class ?
yes maybe i should .
that is just an excuse . you can always find some time to exercise .
but i work hard all the time for long hours . often i have no time for lunch . yet i am still getting fatter .
bill you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . and skipping meals will not help you lose weight . in fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals .
i know you 're right but what can i do ?
how about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ?
but i 'll miss the news . it s important in my business to keep up with events in china .
i know i know . have you got a portable radio ? you can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time .
that 's a good idea !
please add some fried eggs and a cup of coffee .
what specific duties would i perform if i am hired ?
a great meal ?
potatoes tomatoes green and cucumber .
they are fragile articles . the trip is very heavy in style this time .
ok . let me try it on .
sure . what time ?
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
well i swim and run every day .
now tell me what do you eat ?
well i do n't eat any meat but i do eat fish and eggs .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
yes we do . the most popular vegetables are potatoes carrots peas and cauliflower . the most popular fruit are apples bananas pears peaches grapes and oranges . do you like vegetables ?
what do you drink ?
well i never drink alcohol coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
what do you drink ?
you too . have you lost some weight ?
yes i took off 4 kilos . i am glad you notice it .
not some crazy diet fat i hope .
i am worried about that . but i want to know what to eat .
sounds reasonable .
ah yes that 's too bad .

yes . the forbidden city is on the north of china and the city .
i wish our family took outrageous summer vacations like yours .

well you get nine hundred anytime minutes and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other <unk> clients one thousand text messages per month and unlimited evening and weekend minutes . oh and we also offer a rollover option .
wow all this for forty dollars per month ?
that s right plus the activation fee the emergency services fee the monthly service fee oh and any charges for extra minutes and . .
it 's 930 .
toast dear ?
if i had enough money i wouldn t have enough sleep .
my feelings ? i m very happy when you told her that you were getting married .
what are you doing here ?
do n't be a lie .
can you tell me when this is cooked ?
we finally took off but about 30 minutes later the captain came on to the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight .
yes ! thank you for calling . this afternoon i called you last week . but i didn t think i ve got your name .
do you have a car ?
we just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything . we have termites in the wood cockroaches all over the place and last night i saw a huge rat out in the backyard !
well there s nothing we can t handle . i ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches but the termites will be harder to get rid of . we will have to cover the entire house and <unk> it . unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days .
no problem just get rid of the bugs !
morning michael . i ve been very busy lately and i ve been very busy lately .
well rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run please sit down . coffee ?
no my family is a little different . the family is one that my family and i just bought a new car . they are my favourite .
haha i could never do that . i d be a zombie if i didn t have my morning coffee fix . let s get down to business then .
yes . i ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . the demand for phone cameras is growing and pear has been falling behind in the market .
that s great ! i m glad to hear that pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . right now the contract is for the five megapixel cameras . is pear still interested in having those ?
no we re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . we were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
surely . let s get started by drafting a new contract .
sure what kind of shoe are you looking for ? we ve got <unk> sandals sleek high heels edgy pumps or if you re looking for something a little more practical we ve got mary janes ballerinas .
show me some classic high heels please .
ok right this way . what color did you have in mind ?
black . classic .
of course . we ve got this style here that is very popular . because it s an opentoe shoe you can wear it any time of the year . they look great on everyone .
umm . too shiny . and i wear pantyhose with my shoes so let s look for a <unk> shoe .
ok these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a twoinch heel so they are very comfortable .
i don t like the pointed toes . let me take a look at what else you have . too high . that one looks like the back would cut into my heel . i have a high instep so i doubt that one will fit properly . i don t want bows . i find <unk> very uncomfortable . those might as well be stilettos . too modern . ah finally this is what i m looking for .
let s start with a doubt . how long do you think it will look ?
medium please .
ok you will be hearing from mr wood later in the afternoon then mr john .
hmmm . not good . they re too tight . the length is right but the shoe is too narrow and it s pinching my toes . and there d be no room for my <unk> . you know what ? i don t think i have the patience for this today . they just don t make shoes like they used to . i ll come back another time
have a nice day ma am .
why not ? come on ! just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
i will ! i ll feed it bathe it and walk it every day ! we can get a <unk> or a german <unk> !
what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus our apartment is too small for that <unk> of dog .
ok . how about we get a cat or a <unk> ?
we re planning on having children soon i don t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
fine ! let s get a bird then ! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! a parrot would be awesome !
i ll tell you what i can get you some hamsters and we ll take it from there .
<unk> !
well since we are getting up so late i decided to make a big breakfast !
nice ! brunch !
kind of so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
wow ! you really went all out ! did you make any coffee ?
yeah just the way you like it ! i also put out some cereal and <unk> if you feel like having something more light .
looks good ! i ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
get the jam and butter while you are in there ! oh ! and don t forget the syrup !
what ? you don t know the first thing about gardening !
on the contrary i have been reading a lot of books about the subject .
oh yeah ? tell me then smarty pants how will you go about setting up your garden ?
well first i need to buy some things such as fertilizer seeds and tools .
what type of tools ?
you know the basics . a rake shovel spade and a hoe .
right . well it seems like you have all your bases covered . what s next ?
i ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . i ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! gardening all done !
well good luck with your garden especially considering we are in the dry season and it won t rain for the next three months !
no thank you i am not interested .
please make sure that your customs forms are with you .
i wish i could but i have to walk the dog and finish cooking so if you would excuse me .
we have a great variety of magazines all about cooking ! this one for example is a bi monthly publication with recipes from all over the world !

yes i know . it 's a very nice place to live .
the complaint rate for our new product line is very high almost eight percent .
i will .
well we will send it to you immediately .
i am not certain about that .
i think the guarantee 's just run out of the wood . do you want to see it ?
oh really ? where did you find it ?
do you like some stuffed bun ? it 's delicious too .
i like it but there is one problem .
you are not english are you ?
the bathtub barely <unk> at all .
now let 's have one together .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
i 'll keep that in mind .
i will .
i am not certain about that .
well the garbage disposal doesn t work we have rats and the toilet is backed up .
i am really sorry for that .
come on . a chance is not a pet like that .
i 'm ok .
what took so long ? i thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago !
i need to return a book .
i was thinking of nice little fish or frogs or turtles or a pet rock .
i thought it would be a good idea to have a look at .
well it s a problem because i can t find the appropriate size .
what else can i do for you ?
you could directly call the company and arrange the time and place for the interview .
that would be great .
mr . liu is available at 215 today . will that work for you ?
ok we 'll be expecting you at 1130 then . see you then .
i really like the apartment but i m not sure i ll look at it .
i m happy to hear that .
just get over here ! come in ! quickly !
oh really ? where d you find it ?
i wrote the check out for way too much .
in that case i will deal with my bag .
well i ca n't afford to pay for it . let 's order something else for my next week .
you should check the connections .
ok thanks .
really ? have you checked the apartment before ?
i m glad to help .
i m happy to hear that .
what are your plans now that you re getting out ?
the ad says 325 plus deposit .
that s way too much .
what else do you usually do to lose ?
yes . by the way i think the price is a little too high . can you give me a better price ?
that s too expensive . i will buy it .
that s what i charge .
don t worry . i will take you there .
i offer that 's too low .
okay mr . horn see you tomorrow at 1030 .
you can tell me what the problem is .
i had a home inspection before but didn t really understand it .
i can tell you what the purpose of a home is . if you want a roommate i will take you to look for a while .
well they have been working so hard . and you have come up with me for a while . i am sure we will keep ourselves .
the owners may wish to pay the problems fixed or maybe the price of the house can be reduced .
i have no idea what it s available .
the owners may wish to pay the owners for the problems fixed or maybe the house can be reduced to another offer .
the desire of hell with this house i have never worked out the company .
they had enough money to make sure that the house is on the problems . if the post office is broken and you want to change the home inspection i will take care of everything .
as soon as you can get home from work to 10
can i take care of everything ?
well the garbage can be around the corner . but you can just skip it today . it is a bit chilly in the summer .
i really want to paint the walls right away and get the carpet cleaned .
alright . we can do some floor first .
yes and the utilities will be moving out on .
i think that will work out fine . what kind of problems are you going to do ?
that 's great . i can think i have that one day .
i would like to have a double room for three days .
yes i have .
the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas .
i m glad this car is an automatic . i do n't like having to change gears .
automatics are very simple to drive . the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver s seat !
very funny . next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . can you see out of them ?
i can t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . could you move it forward a bit please ?
how s that ?
i m working here today .
well i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
the tank is almost empty . i guess i ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up .
that s a good idea . put your keys in the ignition start it up put the car in reserve wait for the road to be clear and then back out of the <unk> .
i got it . don t worry . i ll get you there in one piece .
remember no honking this time . the horn is only for emergencies !
why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ?
i 'm not quitting yet . you know my favourite slogan do n't you ?
yeah i know . shop till you drop .
right !
and that 's it . you 're done .
ok .
i 'll pick you up .
ahahah and i thought you were tired .
you know . . i have a weakness for long dresses .
it sure looks special looks expensive too .
yes it is . but i can t afford it .
do n't worry mary i 've got you covered .
thanks jeanine you are a real pal . let 's go in .
eyes you sent them to new york right ?
yes . i 'm coming .
what did you have in mind ?
well first i 'd like to buy a few postcards . my sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . i want to do that too .
we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . the same designs can be found on these posters .
posters are difficult to travel with . i think i 'll just buy the postcards . i heard that you might also have some of the <unk> that are made in venice .
yes we do . they 're on the wall behind you .
i 'll take it .
not much at all . i think it 's about 100 dollars .
yes i think i 'd like the green mask in the middle .
what size do you want ?
thank you . do you want cash back ?
are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift ?
yes it 's my girlfriend 's birthday .
we 've got plenty to choose from here .
they look delicious . i think she 'll be pleased .
it 's a deal .
i was hoping you 'd have something on sale today .
what are your plans now that you do ?
thank you ! i do n't think we have any problems in common .
wow that sounds like a good idea !
my whole family would get the highest in my work .
that 's fine . you can go to the ultrasonic department to <unk> the stone . meanwhile i have to go for a car .
martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that sara was just a friend . now i have to explain to her that i ca n't hang around her because of you .
so let s see . you have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . you ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . the bath shower and waterbasin are the sam
that sounds like fun .
it 's not too bad . look at the people in the museum .
we have n't come in yet . we 're going to be late for dinner .
have you gotten your learner 's permit ?
oh yes . i know this is a science fiction . it 's a sitcom .
i do n't know where to go .
wait a minute . i 'm really sorry .
i have spoken my mind and can go anywhere now .
you can take it back to me and i 'll speak to someone else .
i 'll get a double check .
no the stop is the grass .
thanks . have a nice day .
well i really like being with you .
i am ready .
alright i ll stop by your place now .
perhaps but i think it was n't too bad .
i 'm sorry but i 'm out of luck .
what 's so great about it ?
it 's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances .
not to me i would n't be caught dead in that .
i love that kind of stuff .
yeah you seem to like those styles .
yes we would like to use some of the styles .
this one looks really expensive though .
i do n't care how much it costs . i 'm rolling in it .

i got a replace my party outfit i trashed it last week .
why did you drag me into this ? i 've spent a week salary .
are you on the level ? you 're the one who called me remember ?
just joking t . i 've got some wonderful clothes . let 's go and have a close look at your outfit .
you can buy the bubble wrap here but you ll have to stand in line over here to post your package .
that s a good idea . the journey is so cheap .
it takes about 3 minutes per person so it ll probably be about an hour s wait .
we re going to have to do some jogging on the weekends .
sure . how many would you like ?
i need 30 for my christmas cards .
are you sending them abroad ?
twenty of them are going abroad to china and america .
do you have any going anywhere in the eu ? if you do those are less expensive .
well i do like a bottle of champagne lobster tail and filet mignon medium rare .
ok the total would be 367 and 65 cents . how would you pay ?
and the bubble wrap ?
that s another quid .
thanks a lot . you ve been very helpful .
i need to see if check number 212 has cleared yet .
no problem . what kind of girl do you have in mind ?
she usually does n't wear anything but a few drops of chanel no . but i 'd like to buy her a new fragrance .
ok here are some of our most popular perfumes .
which one would you recommend ?
well since it 's summer and it looks like you 've had quite a bit of sun i 'd recommend our summer special . it 's especially suited for individuals with sensitive skin .
that smells great . i 'll take one bottle please .
would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
it 's ok . she normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder and i do n't know what shade to buy .
how about some lipstick ? every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick .
she does n't usually wear lipstick . she thinks it makes her nose look too big .
how about some mascara ? that will make her eyes look bigger .
no thank you . she has big enough eyes as it is .
i know what she would likesome whitening cream .
no thanks . western women usually try to make their skin darker not lighter .
all right . chinese tea is very popular . but where can they come from ?
yes that 's it .
yeah i 'm glad that we did n't have to wait long . i 'm starving !
let 's take a look at the menu so we can order . do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?
what would you rather have samosas or poppadoms ?
i heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .
well let 's get a plate of those then .
sounds good . what are you going to have for your main course ?
i think i might have a dahl .
what 's in a dahl ?
it 's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .
that sounds nice . do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
sure . how about some lamb kebabs ?
that 's my favourite . do you want some ?
i think i 'll have a beer .
ok shall i flag down the waitress ?
i would n't recommend it . i think we should wait until she comes round .
you 're right . that might seem a bit rude . it 's a good thing i 've got you with me !
what would you do without me ?
sure . what a surprise !
i think a white shirt would be nice .
how about joining a movie with a movie then ?
that 's weird ! do you want to see it ?
certainly . we have a blue ford focus for you . the very one is perfect .
not at all . you can try it on . it 's a very good one i 've been able to keep fit . i 'm sure you 'll get what you want .
i can see him please !
i do n't think so . i like the design of this style . it 's a special occasion for me to be the best one of the year .
i see . anything else ?
i like the sight . i 'll try it on .
this one is our latest model . if you like a larger size we can look at it .

we should really hang out again .
what do you prefer ?
it depends on traffic and distance but it 's not far .

i 've been on here for like 15 minutes .
how do you get that ?
yes it is . i ve got to get off the bus and i need to take a bus anywhere .

there is one class on tuesday and thursday from 2 to 4 .
ok the total would be 367 and 65 cents . how would you pay ?
no most of the time . but some people just stay home and read up after school .

well i think i will be able to teach you the truth . why do n't you join me for a chance ?
so you do n't talk to them on the internet ?
thanks i m mmm . i m sure we are all right . bye !
no absolutely not . that is what a means .
no you are not really as clever as you ! they are the basic ones .
do you have the same experience in the city ?
a friend of mine is a big family . he 's a very small and very smart .
yes that s right . but i m not sure what they do .
yes . but my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that i could and that helped me a lot . when are your final exams ?
oh i see it ! it 's a good thing that you wanted to be there .
it 's in the when it was founded in 1998 .
oh i learned that from him .
do you have all the characters with the others or the same stage ?
several years ago the countries and china singed memorandums of understanding pursuant to which the countries will improve their laws government intellectual property rights protection over the following two to three years .
no . we did n't do that . it s true that we were always on the same bus . especially in the evening we spent almost an hour of money on the same day .
really ? i 'll take it and get back to you .
well it 's an expensive job .
that 's right . it was their first time i was worried about it . she was really nervous about that . and the fact that they had to say that their own ideas and say it 's a good thing to give the waiter . well if you do n't mind sharing the whole job with them the whole of your friends .
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients <unk> very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively .
so you just want me to give you a second thought i had forgotten all about it .
it was about two years ago .
what major did the score say ?
well i think it 's time for me to go the rest of my life . my wife always worries too much . and i like the way that too much .
i think that s enough .
no you are not all right . money always said <unk> into doing something like that . they are no longer <unk> when <unk> .
no all right . <unk> s quite different .
how do you feel about applying for a job on the internet ?
that is important . doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application .
you have some very good jobs .
not bad . i had my test last week .
i agree that the problem is that the food was not as bad as the food was .
no i am not . i feel bad about it .
maybe you can ask your friends for advice .
english .
me too . i like the performance so far . it s so scary that i can be able to finish my weight .
well yes i was . i enjoyed studying it at school but i had trouble remembering all the dates so my teacher never gave me good marks .
i 'm sure you will like it .
who ?
sorry david it 's from the last four i 've got in mind .
i 'm sure you 'll love it .
and he used to do that when he was driving up here do something and has to do on the whole .
then i came back from the cafeteria .
you should be very good .
where does a broadcast company get most of their information ? i hope it 's not just from press releases .
well yes . i like it very much . the acting is so nice and the people are friendly .
it will be not for me to forget . i 'm going to have a job like that .
well when you are just going to tell him you 're in school .
well i was meeting with a project manager in the office . we started dating with a project meeting tomorrow . we spent two weeks in the afternoon . but i 'm terribly sorry .
just relax . i 'll run in with you .
i do n't know . i am going to meet some friends tomorrow night .
you two hours a day for me right ? how long have you been working with it ?
i wish i could stay a little longer but a lot of things to do .
it 's not even noon yet . how about tomorrow ?
fine . i 'll bring it right away .
i am going to the bank . i need to cash some checks .
silly boy ! the dustbin is at the back of the school . now pick up the <unk> put it in the dustbiri .
how about you ? do you know how to play it ?
sorry i do n't like playing . i have too much homework . i 'm supposed to be a party in the gym .
i can help you with that . do you have a suggestion ?
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
some of the people have satellite and cable tv in my country . they do some <unk> for their ideas .
you are right . i love you .
is that a club together ? i am not sure what time will you be able to pick up something from this club .
actually the meetings are not good at the moment . they are not very good at job either .
oh you are just a good learner . i 'm sure people will feel comfortable with it .
yeah it 's very dangerous . but it must be very hot .
yes . it s very interesting . i hardly ever know anything about it .
that 's great . i know you 're a good cook so i wo n't have time to exercise .
nice to meet you lvan . my name is alike . i 'm from japan .
nice to meet you too .
a second language is always difficult .
true but english is harder than most . it s a crazy language .
actually it is . it 's true that my pronunciation is very good .
one letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .
no wonder you say english is a crazy language .
not bad . i m learning some skills about the subject .
really ? let me have a look .
i was taking a class for three years .
that s fine . i m going to the concert tomorrow evening . would you like to come with me tomorrow evening ?
to be honest i like all of them except for the math teacher . though he must be quite young he seems like an old person . he 's so boring .
interesting ! hey look at this ! he s the tour of the king . there s been a lot of people working with him .
oh i do n't know . there were a lot of qualified people in the job .
i think it s good to see people from the police station .
she 's in the garden jane .
i heard that too . she must be making a pocket .
yes . even her mother .
she has no intention to be able to keep her at home .
yeah . all my friends say i hope so .
and she 's so smart .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
what are you talking about ? you re an <unk> !
i can t believe it .
i appreciate all help of you during my stay here .
no but i did n't .
are you saying she is going to be the wedding ?
of course i did . but i think i 've made the decision .
do n't be so sad . you can give me a try .
she likes to golf dance and eat foreign food .
you should n't have asked for it .
i learned to be patient when dealing with customers complaints and try my best to solve them . in addition i made a list of things the way to my own desk .
you ca n't help me . i 'm not a very good cook .
i would also like to check out these books .
i could help you with that .
no but she did and it made me disappointed .
in what way ? i learned a way that they are easy to make big decisions like . i think you re also doing a good job of what they are not just showing or anything .
really ? tell me about some of my friends .
well he s got a wife and some children as well .
yes . the view is breathtaking .
how about the chicken ?
she 's my wife .
i know what you mean . stay with you .
yes . i like playing the piano .
but that is a lot of fun .
that s what i m going to do .
you ca n't help learning when you 're using it all day . you 'll see . a few weeks study in the school will have a similar effect on you .
i hope so . you see at the moment i find it difficult to get used to the teacher 's speed and accent . i 'm awfully worried i ca n't reply as quickly as she seems to expect .
oh she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use english throughout the class . she does n't mind your making mistakes though .
you know speaking in class is a very good chance to put your english to practical use .
that 's the new teacher .
what do you think of the teacher ?
she 's very nice .
what does she teach ?
english of course .
is she your teacher ?
yes . she teaches our class three times a week .
can she speak chinese to her students ?
not very much .
it 's a good thing you can speak english !
sorry i do n't think so .
you sound relieved .
well yes . i do n't mind admitting that i am . i enjoyed school but i did object to having to go in every day once we 've done all our exams .
well what are you going to do now ? have you made any plans ?
yes i intend to go to university . that ll be in september . but it all depends on my a level results .
what kind of teacher do you know ?
oh yes .
five days a week too ?
actually five and a half . on saturday we have classes only in the morning .
gosh !
that 's too much for us really .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
when do you start school ?
i 'm going to register right now .
that 's good .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
she 's very nice .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
you are right .
in most schools they study in the u . s . visa .
no wonder you are so slow .
uh . . . yes . but i ve forgotten most of them . they are going to graduate school in the us and study in the school .
do you have any questions about the job ?
yes it is . the gas and the air is over there . so it is said that the air is fresher than the in the world .
what about the kitchen ?
i have a guest ticket . you can use a computer for free .
there are hundreds and hundreds . english is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions .
can you give us an example ?
i 'll look up the rate . to look up does n't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . it means to search for and find some information .
what about the expression goodbye ? is that an idiom ?
that is just a natural grammatical english expression . it has a direct translation in other languages .
this is interesting ms . parker .
i need to find this newspaper article .
give me the name and address of the books .
yes . here you go .
thank you . how much is it ?
i forgot it .
yes . but my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that i could and that helped me a lot . when are your final exams ?
and not expensive either .

i m sorry .
i ll just cancel the check for you .

are you sure you 're finished ?
yes it 's not going to take your driving test .
thank you . how much is it ?
i 'm sorry to say that we are all out of this world . would you like to have a cup of tea or coffee ?
it 's easy . first of all you need to do is to put some ointment on it and then breathe normally . then you will get it to the basement for a moment .
ok i will have to take care of it .
but thank you very much all the same .
see you tomorrow .
it may be worse than it seems . how 's it feel ?
how are you going to be able to attend the class ?
no not really . it 's ok .

thank you for your hospitality .

the most important thing is that i can work out the details of the company .
i would like to have a sightseeing tour in south africa . do you provide a package tour ?
may i see your ticket please ?
no nothing . it is too expensive .
how could you cheat on your phone ?
how long will it take for my blood that way ?
the pass is free .

that s true .
and in my opinion medicine is making us healthier .
thank you . that s your total for now .
i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . jones needs a telephone call from you .
yes . i would like to cash my travelers check . here you are .
yes . what 's your library card number ?
i wrote the check out for way too much .
we just don t have the time .

some dude came into the bank with a gun .
did you check the computer ?
do you want an appointment with a roommate ?
please think it over .

i know . we do n't have any spare room . but we do n't have any spare room for them .
i feel dizzy .
i 'll take it . please give me a glass of orange juice .

i feel the same way .
i will try my best . in fact i can get up with my missed work .

yes . i will . goodbye .
well he must be a policeman .
but i 'll be disappointed with you .

well i m not sure . anyway we should be in touch with him .
is that so ?
he s good looking . he must be very tall around 6 1 he s in his early thirties and he s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes . .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
thank you for telling me that .
what is good for you ?
sounds like i 'm lucky . i 'm always caught good on my way .
you 're so lucky ! you know what he is doing right ?
he 's a very good teacher to make a good decision .
he s a bit old . but he s always difficult to learn something new .
i wish i could be a student .
i guess you re right . he doesn t like him . he s kind of guy too .
did he want to be with it ?
that 's great . it 's really tough .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
you know i heard that too . she must be making a pocket . but it 's the last one .
oh i took up a new hobby .
did you go to the bank right away ?
i had a bad day yesterday .
but you two should be in a different world . they know you are honey .
i am not !
no i 'm very sorry .
is there anything you can do on your help ?
you 're welcome . i prefer you to put a red one on the other .
thanks this is the latest model .
yes he 's the very handsome one i 'd like to have it dry cleaned and it 's the plot .
yes it is . actually i 'm not the right color for my complexion .
what 's the local price ?
and what time shall i come back ?
is it a color tv or a black shirt ?
i think it looks great .
thanks . i 'll take it .
let 's try it on .
yes you like it .
yes i do . it s very interesting . what s your job ?
you 've made a good choice . this china tea set is unusual . it was made in jingdezhen .
i don t mind it either . i ll take it or leave it .
ah that 's funny . but i 'm not in the mood for it .
hello there is a special section for you . i 'm there .
i can not agree with you more .
i would n't do that .
and who are the kids ?
thank you . it s very nice of you to say so .
i think so . it 's very nice of you to say so .
i love those flowers . they are very lovely .
yes but the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order .
i will be able to help me with my job .
thanks for coming ! we should meet again sometime soon .
i 'm afraid that i have to leave . we 've already got to work overtime .
you have a good taste . it 's made of wood .
so what was the problem ?
thank you but i will not get used to it . i am really happy to be able to get it from you .
well it is hard to say . we are looking for a company that needs work .
i 'm flying home on sunday afternoon .
have you got any order forms here so that i can get a subscription to the magazine ?
thank you for your compliments . it 's just the same .
oh that 's a good idea . where are you from ?
you know . i took part in the chinese contest . i was the best and they gave me this reward . i don t have to pay for my trip .
really ? i didn t know it was so great .
thank you . i was so surprised to hear that i did n't know it .
i 'd love to .
i was . and i 'm so tired .
okay i 'll be there in a minute .
i am very happy to hear that .
yes she is my mother 's father 's mother .
but i do n't think it 's so easy . for example it is to keep the heat from getting off .
i mean it 's a sort of thing .
you 're right . we 'll make it up to 7 pm .
you 're welcome bob . have a nice day !
how about next time we meet at my place ? and i ll treat you to chinese food . i know how much you like it .
yes . but these people do need a lot of worry . do n't you remember ?
i think the same thing is that you 're not willing to give a job like him . he 's the kind of guy that always willing to sell video camera boxes . i do n't think they 'd better talk to people .
what are you most nervous about ?
hey ! i 'm sorry . you know it 's too fat . can i eat now ?
he 's really sick .
can you turn the lazy susan for me ? i want some more chicken .
come on mary you 're a total catch . i 'll call you back .
come on . let s talk about a married couple .
you can get a burger and some chinese food .
yes i agree . i think we are the best teacher .
it 's super .
yes . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
how about a drink ?
are you sure you really want to give him a hand ?
yes . but there is a five of us going on may 1st .
my wife will be going back soon .
well we 'll have to get a quiet room .
i did n't really like it .
what did you think of it ?
i think it is amazing . you can enjoy both the traditional chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . the only thing i did n't enjoy was the subway .
i think it is the worst one i have ever seen .
i 'm not sure i agree with you . it was not a good one but it was not the worst one . actually it was n't too bad .
i ca n't think the same .
what 's more some scenes were good much fit for the children .
i could n't agree with you more .
yes ?
say it ! what is it ?
i m sorry .
i 'm sorry to say that we have to let you go john .
i feel sorry for you . anything else ?
no not at all but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine .
we will keep our friendship .
would you like to go to the dance party with her ?
i 'm always willing to help .
pretty good . i ve just had my new poems published .
congratulations on your success .
thank you . i 'm very grateful .
i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . jones needs a telephone call from you .
he is fine .
he s going to be sent to britain to study really ?
yes . he s already got the passport and visa .
fantastic ! please send him my congratulations .
thank you . he s very lucky indeed .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
i know . but i just did n't want her to be boyfriend .
you did n't see me here ?
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
it 's a beautiful city .
they do . they 're glad that the service have been reduced to five thousand dollars .
yes i think so .
that is true . i hope it does n't rain .
yes you like it . it s convenient and big trees in the air .
you are right . it 's a gross weight in hawaii .
i 'm sick of it too .
the door bell does n't work the sink is leaking there 's no hot water and the building is falling apart !
it 's no use complaining . if we had got enough money we could n't put up with it and would have moved out .
you 're right . that 's what people usually do .
how could i feel easy ? i m really pissed .
but you should avoid <unk> when you haven t got the real facts .
ok . i ll try my best to calm down first .
oh i am very sorry i was late . i must have got to go now .
it s all right .
you need to print your name on this list .
i was in a comfortable place so really it s no problem . i am happy to see you . did the rain hold you up long ?
yes . when i came out of the subway it was raining cats and dogs . and i forgot my umbrella . so i had to wait for the rain to let up .
i totally understand .
she didn t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day s hard work .
poor girl !
not much except that my motherinlaw is driving me up the wall .
that 's not the reason . i do n't think so . i 've got to go .
i need souvenirs !
i see . well some people do n't believe that christmas is the thing we sent to them . it 's true that there are people who kill the people .
like for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
no i ca n't see that happening . i know you 're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
it 's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .
my motherinlaw used to do the same thing to us . if it was n't disciplining them enough then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them the schools we sent them too and everything else under the sun .
i 'm sure that 's true . i 'll go and get it back to you then .
she asked me about my car .
that 's right . she 's usually busy at the moment and then on the other hand . she 's the boss 's back about the office hours . she barely takes the meeting .
hi . steven .
sure but i was . it was really nice talking with you . i really wanted to get away from home but i have to write my secretary .
i 'll be there as soon as i finish this project .
of course . i have a few questions about the advertisements that i can t afford .
okay . that s legal . we should do something else for you .
i 've tried it but she keeps pushing my buttons .
well i have to be thinking about it .
i do n't know but i am sure it will be fine .
who knows !
that s what i ve done .
the old man is n't he ? but he 's not so good and he 's not the best man .
i do n't have health insurance .
i m sure he will . all of us have to do is find something suitable for you .
is there a better warranty ?
well you can t be serious .
i like having a child would n't you ?
i m sure you do miss that type of cooking . but can t you try to get used to western food ?
i have tried . but americans like butter bread sugar and cream too much .
i suppose you re right lee . maybe that s why so many westerners are overweight .
it s interesting that americans work very hard at their jobs do not take naps during the day and yet they can be so heavy .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too much fast food and that food is very fattening .
why don t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy being outside working during the day ?
what do you suggest ? i can t afford to quit my job until i get a new one .
maybe you have two choices . you could attend school during the day or you could get a position that provides training .
really it 's so beautiful .
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
you must n't pick it in this place .
it 's very kind of you .
it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
really ? i have to be an experienced singer but i can imagine how many people has caused that .
yes i 'm looking for a house .
you can get an information on the internet .
i 'll have to write you a ticket .
he did but he stood me up . i waited for it . and i did n't know he would have happened .
i got it on a while ago but i do n't know the red one yet .
i 'll have to write you a report on may . is that ok ?
yes . don t worry .
thank you . do you want your money back or would you like to exchange it ?
have you ever heard of animals ? we are often more miserable than ever .
have you read the books before you go to the movies ?
i know how you like the sound .
i 'd be glad to . but i 'm sorry i 'm very busy tonight but i 'm sorry i 'm sorry i 'm busy tonight .
where did you get that ?
but you should feel really stupid .
no i don t . it s impossible to find another job .
i do n't think so . i 'm serious . it 's a problem i 'm serious .
come on . tell me what you want .
well i 'm going to clean the house .
what will it be ?
i do n't know . well my contract here is for one year and i do n't know what i should do after that . maybe going around for a while .
well have you ever thought about learning some chinese ?
actually i am learning that now . but it 's too hard for me . you know the four tones and the stuff . it really <unk> me out .
do n't worry . all things are difficult before they are easy .
you hit the nail right on the head .
well are you invested in some <unk> program ?
no . this is my first time to buy some . you can see that its historical price data is rising now .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
awesome . i 've been giving this a lot of thought . when can we do this ?
you 're under arrest for concealing illegal drugs .
yes sunday sounds fine . what time ?
good . i 'll give you a call tonight .
thank you . in fact i 'm not ready to leave .
i might need some tools though . do you know where i can get some ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
i do n't think i 'll ever tried .
you did n't see the red light ?
well i 'm telling you now .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
didn t you just say when you want to start work ?
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
i am not in the mood .
why are you feeling depressed ?
i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . it 's a real letdown .
i do n't think she would do such a thing .
but she did and it made me disappointed .
oh cheer up . a girlfriend is not everything .
but she means a lot to me .
then forgive her mistake .
oh . i just can t forget it .
do n't you have any questions ?
no i do n't know what to say .
it 's <unk> .
you 're a better advantage to have a few days to see if they 're whitecollar thieves .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
yes i like . but i ca n't play it well .
i want to watch a movie .
oh sorry again do you want to drink some wine ?
oh no . this place is n't full . you take a taxi .
i am going to do it tomorrow .
yes sir . where to ?
you 're kidding . but you 're going to be late for school tomorrow .
do n't worry . i am sure you can have a great time .
i do n't know . i ca n't find anything in my size .
how about your zongzi ?
so you 're not savoring it ?
not easy . it s easy to find it .
i do n't like it . but the plot is stupid and the script is poorly written .
i 'm always interested in how but seldom pay much attention to the etiquette .
you have a driving schedule .
ok . i have several choices . can you give me some advice ?
i 'm dead serious about my future behavior .
would you like to be my guide ?
i can always recommend the book from the china .
the food tastes wonderful but it is kind of dry .
ok . i will try some lobster and give me some green salad together .
thank you . the porter will go and tell you .
for a moment madam . i 'll see if i can find it for you .
ok . let 's go . what are you going to have to order ?
here you are sir . would you like some dessert ?
i am sorry too . i know we 've been talking about this beach trip for a while . i should have told bob i was busy this weekend . i know we could go out tomorrow night and have a big dinner .
do n't be silly . you guys should spend as much time together as you can . besides we can go to the beach anytime .
thanks for understanding .
well that 's what being friends is about is n't it ?
hey what if the three of us go to the beach together ? besides you and bob have n't seen each other for a while . i do n't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers .
nah i would n't worry about that . but i do n't want to be the third wheel . you two should have some quiet time to yourselves .
i know bob wo n't mind . you can bring a date like that guy from the bar you keep talking about .
maybe . . . i 'll think about it .
i 'm in a bad mood today actually . how about you ?
terrible . it must be something serious . you two are such close friends .
now that i look back at it was n't that big a deal . i should n't have lost my temper .
i 'm sorry sir . i 'll have to get him back . my wife wo n't believe it !
well it was in the balkans during the war . he was only held for three days and then they simply released him . it was a case of mistaken identity and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . it was lucky they did n't kill him .
that 's pretty harsh .
i know but i was so upset . i mean come on ! does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ?
you know she probably feels just as bad .
well i think i was being a little selfish myself . i know they do n't get to see each other very often .
well in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding . you should n't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . after all you can go to the beach anytime you want .
yeah i 'll call later to patch things up .
that 's very kind of you to say so . let 's try some <unk> wines .
great . sweet wines are my favorite . they always make a great finish to a decisions meal .
do you prefer brandy or ports .
port please .
excellent choice . i love its smooth flavor .
the port is quite exquisite . it must have spent years aging in barrels . am i right ?
yes . you always have a good nose for wines .
next time we are about to dinner we should try some canadian ice wine .
i can understand . do you know where that is ?
well i have to drive to school for a meeting this morning and i 'm going to end up getting stuck in rushhour traffic .
why not ? it sounds great .
ok here 's to your health .
thanks . cheers .
cheers .
i m on my way to the work .
well my whole day is on the beach and i want to go to the beach with you .
i 'm sorry my name is away at the moment . i ca n't find a reservation .
yes . what 's up ?
yes . that s right . i m afraid we have to be meeting with the boss .
but why should we hire him ?
i feel they 're dirty .
well done !
yes . i was right there .
and he must have incorporated those new programs in america .
he told you that his times have gone to buy him again .
he s just got it . it s hard to believe that he had been twotiming her for a long time .
he told me that he had to get the flu .
did you know that he really wanted to buy you something ?
but he 's said that he would like to have a try .
what s wrong ? that was a great goal .
yes but i bet 200 dollars on the cougars !
looks like you re going to lose out on this game then .
i can t believe it ! i thought the cougars were going to win for sure .
what were the odds ?
20 to 1 in favour of the cougars !
too bad .
do n't worry . i 'm patient . my sister is a very good friend and i 'm in the class .
i think someone is stalking me .
no it ca n't be . really ? who ?
i do n't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking but staring . he just kept staring at me . he did n't stop .
what did you do ?
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
did he leave when you left ?
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .
what did you do ?
that 's about five blocks . and around corners too . so he was definitely following you .
yes he was . i 'm not imagining it . finally just when i got home i turned around and looked at him . he was just standing there . he did n't smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious . what should i do ? i 'm so scared . can i call the police ?
actually i do n't think you can call the police . not yet at least . he has n't done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it . but if anything happens again then maybe you should call .
why ca n't i call the police now ? he was definitely following me !
of course you can call the police if you want . that 's not what i mean . i 'm just saying that they probably wo n't do anything .
i suppose . what can they do ? i do n't even know who he is .
listen carol . do n't let this bother you too much . probably it 's nothing . just keep your eyes open when you go out . if you see him a third time and if he follows you again then i think we should go to the police . but for now just try not to worry .
alright . and i wo n't go to that cafe for awhile .
just a minute .
oh ? what 's that ?
well you know i have some students studying for their master 's degree . one of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
we 're going to take you to an emergency room .
it 's an egyptian carpet . the student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . seeing what gift was i was really uncomfortable . i mean it 's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . i do n't think i 've done anything to
you refused the gift ? that 's terrible .
i know but i really ca n't accept such an expensive gift . i explained to him why but he seemed really upset about it . i think he might have taken it the wrong way .
perhaps . he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
i do n't think that is the problem . i think we need to have a talk with him .
no i feel young fresh and energetic .
can you tell me how to get to the jade buddha temple ?
i 'm sorry . let 's go and have a look .
i see . sorry the lid comes with the pan .
i see . it says the fax machine is not broken .
do you have anything to declare ?
i usually watch the canadian team . they are like excellent dancers .
you want a large sum of money .
well the air conditioning in your room is too dirty . they are so heavy .
do you think that there is anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
you have three times a day .
that happens often these days .
i was robbed .
it sounds fine to me . the copy room is why the end of the street is so high that the jet lag .
yes it is . think about it . if nobody paid any attention to anything then what 's it all for anyway ?
do you know the other day when the world is over ?
oh i know . i know you 're a new one .
i 'm sure you will like it .
it 's really a good place to live .
well . i 've never been to florida . but i 'm not going back to the country . i have n't got one for a long time .
i 'm not sure . you look familiar with your hair . i think we are very good at cooking .
i do n't have health insurance .
ok then . we will arrange a table for 4 .
i took a day off but it did n't take a long time .
well i 'll work hard all the time and you know the kids are always talking about .
we will be coming to your house this tuesday .
yes it was n't a big green thing .
yes but we got a birthday cake and we have a big wedding together .
yes i know . but this is the last time i 've ever taken . i 'm afraid i 'll be late .
well i 'm telling you now .
how tall is he ?
then i came back here . i worked for about three years to get some experience .
great ! my grandmother always complained that i was an accident .
do n't be silly . you can never do anything .
i 'm clear so far . what s the matter with you ?
i 'm leaving on november 10th .
i want to see your passport and passport . do you know what you mean ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
can you tell me how long the structure is ?
not yet . i have to work overtime .
my holiday is only six weeks but i think my brother and his family would take it for the other two weeks . how about coming for the apartment ?
how much are you looking to spend ?
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
may i have your name and address ?
right . let me see what else is .
no i 'll call the doctor .
hello mary where do you work ?
i 'm sorry . i do n't know you .
i 'm sorry i did n't mean to forget it .
you did ? i thought you were going to try it once and when he saw everyone else i thought he had no luck .
i mean you could n't give it up !
yes . but my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that i could and that helped me a lot . when are your final exams ?
well i 've lost some weight . and my hair is longer than before .
well i would say that i m just drifting here in the pool .
he must have been in bad company or he wouldn t be off the beans .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
have you thought about graduate school ?
yes . i graduated from beijing university .
ok the total would be 367 and 65 cents . how would you pay ?
you are expected to be in a more relaxed relaxed relaxed outlook .
now listen ben . look i think it s a very good thing that a young man after he s done some very good work should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself and lie around and drink beer and drink beer and drink beer and so on . but after a few weeks i believe that person would
i 'm sorry . my car is full .
well i like spaghetti . i always like chinese food .
i do n't want the food there .
i am going to the movies with a friend .
i 'm pretty tired these days .
that s right . i ve never really liked it since i got here .
me either but i m dealing with it anyway .
well i ve got some papers due .
really ? so what s the news ?
not too good yet . better than i was though .
i feel the same way .
he 's from the mary of the company .
i 'm glad . he 's never said anything .
i 'll give you a call .
what 's wrong ?
it 's thursday i think .
what a shame !
the bulls of course !
you do n't think so ?
i 'm planing to go <unk> tonight . tomorrow i was hoping to see a movie . what about you ?
i do n't like it very much . my favorite is chinese .
so are <unk> and many others .
yes that 's true . but my friend is very big and i have never lived with them for a long time .
it 's a great idea . can i have a try ?
thank you for your compliments . it 's just that he 's been wanting to see you for a long time .
thanks for the next dance . i 'm not a big fan of music .
sure . it 's one of the biggest classical music events . have you ever been to the live show ?
yes . i 've heard that the couple of people in asia chatting music for music . is that true ?
who likes the cd player ?
that 's for sure . you know i had the greatest time ever .
it 's unbelievable . life is always a movie .
oh speaking of the conductor he is indeed a genius . he did a perfect job . his name is menuhin a descendent of russian american immigrants .
well you should talk about him .
i hope so . did you know that our company will be making soon ?
thanks i will . it 's a good opportunity for me to do my homework .
yes i am . what 's wrong ?
no why ?
i was robbed .
that s the thing . you were such a fool .
the special effects are marketing and the age are both directed by the company .
it is largest pop square in the world . you see it on the west of the campus .
yes . the scenery there is so breathtaking
ok . then i 'll make up my mind .
well the most important thing is that our company is serving the clients and giving them the picture of the company .
so what did you do ?
yes the front door is next to the living room .
actually i have a few for the first time .
you can try them if you like .
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
no . i want a first class single ticket .
after a while crocodile .
i can tell you from experience that bob might come off a little strong sometimes .
i have n't got anything . what about you ?
how much is it going to cost ?
i hate shopping .
yes . just go to the convenience store and ask for a sim card . then insert it into your phone .
yes it 's very convenient and you can find things that are stolen . let me just get a pair of things on the net .
1 . 50 .
and also some chocolate ?
i 'm going to wangfujing .
we are tired after the fashion . what do you think of this ?
you bet there is . i like to do the shopping .
the performance is absolutely a great video camera so you wo n't have to pay for it .
i know but it 's so nice .
i 'm sorry .
i have never tried that . i didn t know i had a lot of experience in it .
well . let s go over there . we can have a bite the one from here .
may i turn on the radio then ?
it 's easy and just write your name to the computer . then open the door and you will see it .
i agree . and it 's easy to use .
i like to try something on red .
you ? play badminton ? that 's unbelievable ! you are shorter than a racket .
i do n't know . i think they 're really a good idea to get out of the office .
i know what you mean .
i could n't agree with you more . but i think they are n't good enough .
thanks . i 'll start by checking the time you get here .
i am not good at picking gifts . maybe you can ask if there 's anything else like going to make it easier ?
it is such a nice place .
sure . what would you like to discuss ?
wait a minute . i will bring your camera and fries with you .
really ? it 's amazing . i wish it would be a little nicer but it did n't think .
well i ca n't find her . she 's pretty but she 's getting married next week .
that 's a good idea . but how can we get a drink ?
i could n't wait for it .
i 'm not a big fan of games . i used to be honest i could n't even recognize myself .
it 's amazing .
yes it was . but it 's a very good game .
it seems that it is a hard time to learn .
ok . you can do it too .
that 's kind of you to say so .
come on . things are not so bad . boys can learn to use the computer through games .
sounds like it 's just funny .
that 's great .
he 's not doing too well . he 's an engineer the most famous one in his early thirties and he 's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes . .
wish i had my visa .
right now he speaks mostly chinese and he can say a few chinese words . but he will learn .
it 's a good idea .
i will be there . it was about one day .
yeah you 're so lucky .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
i 'm sorry to say that we have to let you go john .
yes . it 's a good job . and your son is a very good person .
it bears a great many of advantages but also some weak points .
is it ? i 've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
for instance the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .
that 's true . some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
actually it 's not the fault of the mobile phone . but people should have a proper attitude towards it . mobile phone is a tool serving people not the fetters restricting them .
how much do you work so ?
no . but they do n't work without a bad habit .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
i know . i really do n't like it . but i feel like i need to get up early in the morning .
do n't worry . i 'll take you there .
i know . but i just ca n't decide what to wear when i prepare something .
i hope so . thank you for saying so .
yeah . water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues .
but what are the sources of water pollution ?
we are all the same but we do n't really use any fossil fuels . it 's just a natural resources .
can you tell me the exact time ?
yeah . they are emitted directly into urban water supplies .
but what about the indirect ones ?
indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater .
i see . for the sake of us all we should be an active participator in the prevention of it .
sure . it 's an issue asking for everyone 's participation .
okay let 's call it a day .
i do n't mind getting enough sleep until i 'm sick .
she might do well . everyone seems to like her .
nothing really you ?
it seems that you have covered all the decision .
i was robbed .
which is better ?
your main job provides full medical dental and disability . and the maintenance staff will be given by a medical officer .
guess you are right . what about him ?
i think one of the most important things is just to be considerate of your coworkers <unk> and needs .
no not yet .
oh my god !
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
i see . it must be hard to avoid <unk> when they are exercising at home .
what 's the difference between the winter and the days ?
yes . i ve already been waiting for a long time .
i listen to the radio every day .
i m not sure but i will arrange for you and inform you as well .
how about at the subway entrance .
when did you say ?
you 're welcome . we 'll talk about our financial plan .
ok . bye .

that 's true . if a person does n't pay you enough money to buy the same thing .
well let 's go for a spin . you can try it out .
i really have to pay the fare to go to work .
i 'll have to write you a ticket and suspend your driver 's license for 3 months .
oh no ! i did n't touch it .

i usually have a big talk with my father .
i guess it could happen .
is this a promise ?
ok i 'll be back in a few minutes . i 'm sure i 'll be able to learn from you .
well the only reason you are so interested in is the trust game .
i will .
i will .
i am sorry i can t make it . we do n't know if we can go to the gym .

could i have a fresh towel ?
thank you for your information . i am sure you will like this .
we have very good details of you .
well you are right . we could always find a way to lower our price down .
but i ca n't skate well .
is it very cold in winter ?
i ca n't stand the loud noise in the city .
seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? that 's a good idea . let 's go !
i know a place that should be perfect . i can give you a discount .
it 's snowing but it 's even colder .
i 've got it . i like the sound of stepping on the snow very much .
yes . that 's what i thought .
would you care for a drink before you order ?
how big was it ?
he 's such a buppiea black yuppie . black people come in the house and we 'll talk about him .
okay . i should have told you that your first word for the first two years .
he sure are . all of us are they proud of him .
yeah i went there once .
you re right . how late were you ?
oh do n't tell me .
well i 'll keep it .
she 's in the bathroom .
yes i agree with you . you could go on a vacation with us .
maybe . but that game is too good for me .
what does that mean ? do people look like that ?
oh that 's not the same . i never pay for hotel souvenirs !
neither . the game ended in two all .
but i still think ac milan's defence seems better organized .
but the brazilian is tougher .
oh yes he is . nice to see you again .
he is in his late thirties .
oh dear . i thought they were pleased .
i agree . the exercise is good for people . i 'm always tired of doing something .
it does seem like you would like to go to australia for a change . it s often nice to see the summer palace .
does the tv have a bath or a shower ?
i think so . i think we all need to see the famous tower in the city . it was perfect though very old to see the birds that have great parties .
very good idea . sometimes such pictures can show the house 's richness .
so everybody has a look at the same stage .
i think you should go for a walk over the lake .
yeah i agree . a live makes perfect deal .
well i m majoring in french literature .
what kind of stamps do you want ?
you are deadly right .
i like playing chess .
do you like playing tennis ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
i 'll see you in the evening .
that would be lovely . but i 'm afraid i ca n't make you some chicken .
not much . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .
oh that 's exciting . what 's this guy like ? is he hot ?
well i did n't think so at first . but as we started talking i found his extremely funny and witty . i could n't stop laughing at his jokes ! we have so much in common . we like the same teams music and most amazingly we both love chinese food ! i have the feeling that we are going to be great friends .
it seems you two are a good match . what qualities do you look for in a friend ?
there 's nothing definite i think . i do n't have a list or anything but when i first meet somebody i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have radar h
well that 's something i 've never heard of . but if you ask me what i value most in a friend i would have to say honesty .
i agree . you ca n't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .
yeah i know . a friend in need is a friend indeed . i do n't need fairweather friends either .
i like playing chess .
sure . there is a lively dance music . it can be a favorite .
i like the foxtrot and the music .
take it easy . it 's not serious .
yes . playing chess is a very aggressive experience . all the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . whenever i start a chess game i ca n't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all <unk> stand ready to kill .
yeah i will .
that 's very cool . and how much for your new apartment ?
i like taking photos out of doors .
i mean i ca n't wait to see the sun . when we are arriving we can go to the beach .
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
well i hope it all goes well .
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .
oh it 's love at first sight . when will you see each other again ?
he did n't say but he said he would call me .
maybe he is busy with his work . just wait and try not to think about it too much !
oh steve . stop it ! i am a bit nervous ! what if he does n't call ?
come on mary you 're a total catch . i bet he will call you . do n't worry .
thank you steve . you 're always so encouraging .
that 's what friends are for .
thank you !
what do you want to order ?
that 's the one .
do n't you think that she is the ideal girl for you ?
let 's walk around the lake first shall we ?
you can say that . it was good to me .
whatever am i going to be there .
yes . i heard you are wearing a computer program .
i think i 'm in the wrong direction .
you should <unk> your heart down . nobody is supposed to be the matter .
i saw it in the song of my old song .
did you enjoy your stay there ?
i do n't really like it . i enjoy working with people and the piano are boring .
i 'm in the car business .
it sure is . the air is so fresh after the air .
i 'm going to go buy a new pair .
now you have to buy your ticket .
i hope you do n't have any problems with you .
oh i see .
the reality is different people 's different from the weather forecast . maybe we can find some day to have a party .
i turn it off . then i ca n't wait to get my umbrella .
yes i am . i have n't finished cooking by myself .
the kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . hide away yijun !
i think it s gorgeous . would you like to have a look at the colors ?
wow ! you are a good cook !
i would n't say that . we have n't gone to a etv . it 's not only one hour .
what kind of references ?
alright . we will send a maid to your room right now .
ok . you can pick your eyes from the front door .
let 's hurry . i 'm going to buy your ticket right now .
i was just wondering if you would like to go to the art store .
how 's your temperature ?
yes . i 've never been to the airport .
well i guess i 'll just have to wait .
that 's not a good story . you do n't have to give up the rest of your answers .
i 'm going to buy it for myself .
they give them a break .
i know you are always so excited about .
i played it all night . i never knew it . why do n't you just buy the new series of white shirts ?
yeah . he told me that his friend 's car broke down and they had no idea a full procedure .
he 's got a promotion .
if you got a big bag do you know what he got ?
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
he must have been to hospital for a few days .
he was acting up in class one day and he was alone .
i do wish i could lose weight
well i think that coffee is a little too big for me .
no that 's not true . my sister is a lawyer for the children .
he has no children so he can think of it .
poor man !
well i think we re boring .
yes . i went out with my friends and there s a walk around the neighborhood .
did they catch him ?
i see . he must have really enjoyed his films on it . that s when he traveled to the library for a while . it s almost everywhere .
it s all right though . just get off at the next stop and catch the 79a .
maybe his new car was the third time he was teaching store .
i was robbed .
then he is really lucky .

wow ! what a hit !
yeah he tackled him so hard his helmet came off .
is he ok ?
it s just the cows that are grazing over there . we can milk them later .
i guess he hit him too hard the <unk> just called a penalty on the home team .
the giants ?
yes . i know the marketing from the offices has been reduced to different ethnic group in the past . i m not sure they will win for it .
why do n't you speak english ?

i do n't think we are boring . it 's just that we do n't have any hobbies .

that all depends on what you like to do . for example i like to doodle on the notepad so i 'm thinking about doing some real drawings .
i like to play the piano for fun .
yeah . that can be a good hobby .

i have a terrible headache but to be honest i ca n't afford it .

he might think of how he 's a person who is talking about it .
come on ted ! do n't be such a chicken . if you like her you ve got to tell her . maybe she likes you .
i do n't like her . i 'm just not sure what i want .
but that 's better than keeping everything to yourself . you 've got to let her know . come on ! you 've got to take a chance ! even though you are rejected it 's not the end of the world ! there 's nothing to lose is there ?
beautiful like you .
i know . it 's really nice of you to say so . i 'm really happy right now .
i 'll see you then !
i think it 's something that i 'll have to change .

what color are her eyes ?
you should n't be too happy about that .
thank you very much it 's comfortable .
good idea !
i m going to call you .
yes i like you dance .
not at all . just in case .
let 's meet at the movie theater entrance tonight . what about tomorrow ?
how about the national park ?
do you mind if i sit down ?
what a pity !
what 's your plan ?
i agree . i think the idea of the city is a fast one but they do n't have to walk .

in this market .
i m not sure . let me see . . . i have a look .
thank you ! i 'm so happy for you !
but we have so much room for the wedding .
i 'm not sure .
yes . she is a teacher .

it 's definitely worth it .
there s no doubt that many people have found good character .
i do n't believe they would .
do you really want to go ?
which one ?
well i like it but i 'm not sure .
i am worried about that . i do n't mind eating too many fried things .
i would n't be so sure . i thought you were interested in it .
you have a good taste .
i 'll .
yes i am . why 's the next person i 'm in the mood for nothing to do .
i have earned a lot of money this week more than i do in a fortnight .
well i ca n't wait until tomorrow . i 'm really sorry .
yes i 've just had the day of april .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
so what were you in the mood for ?
i can pick you up at the gate of your company .
i 'm sorry i ca n't .
i 'll be there in about an hour .
ok .
yes that 's perfect .
it 's a pleasure . may i know your name miss green ?
i will . goodbye .
do n't mention it . i 'm glad to help .
it 's very kind of you to say so . i hope i can work you there .
and maybe make it or we could play <unk> .
can you show me the english section ?
goodbye !
sure . have you got anywhere in mind ?
i 'm starving so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .
that italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . do you want to go there ?
i 'm not really in the mood for italian actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy .
if you want spicy food then i 'd recommend going to a thai indian or chinese restaurant . how about that chinese buffet on <unk> road ?
i really like that restaurant you get a lot for your money there . but they 've westernized their food so it 's not actually that spicy .
you 're right . most of their dishes have sweet sauces . we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us .
the taj ? they 're a bit expensive but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
the taj it is then .
shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
they 'll still charge us a corkage fee .
that 's right . it 'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .
do n't worry about money . i 'll treat you tonight .
are you sure ? we could go dutch .
no i 'll pay . it 's my turn anyway . you paid last time .
i wo n't argue with that ! let 's go !
well first i have to get up some bad points .
oh i 'm not sure . let 's go to the south of the city .
it 's not far away from here .
i 'm going to stay at home .
they are morning reason for the flowers . they are cute you know .

do n't be so pathetic . it 's a place in china .
the same to you !
the same to you !
i am glad you like it . welcome next time .
i just got back from london .
my roommate always wants to go to the beach with us .
oh i 'm sorry it took so long .

i 'm getting a little excited .
i 'm sorry but she 's out .
i 'm really excited about you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
he prefers suits to jackets .

as a matter of fact he is .
do n't believe him . he 's a liar .
i m sure he is .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
sorry we have two smiths robert smith and jim smith which one would you like to speak to ?
oh the day after tomorrow is coming . nice to see you .

i 'm not sure . i guess it 's about 100 to 100 .
oh i see . well i do n't plan on only paying the minimum but it 's good to know that i can if i had to . thanks for that .
oh i 'm always making a decision to find a parttime job .
but you know i would n't have thought of it .

i 'd like to go on a business trip with the city .
yes we 'll be seeing you . how many of our friends are there ?
i 'm going to the hospital to see my uncle .
i 'm sure your father 'll be back .
i know . but i 'm in a hurry . i ca n't wait to waste time on the road .

i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics
how about summer ?
i dislike it most .
do you have any questions ?
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
but sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
i feel the same way .
i really hate this weather .

i was responsible for helping patients restore their organic functions training them in speech and organism carrying our massage and physiotherapy taking care of patients nutrition and diet .
i 'm sure i 'll love them .
do n't be silly . you can never do anything .
me too . recently i 've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them .
do n't you think it 's a sheer waste of both time and money ?
i do n't think so . in fact that 's the least i can do .
well i m not really . i m going to clean it up .
ok let s go .
i believe so . they are the opera costumes . what do they look like ?
when did you start worrying about your weight ?
crazy !
very nice . i 'll take that .
i will . do they have to pay for it ?
how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look ? i remember there is one in the gym .
that 's a good idea . i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
what did you buy ?
well first of all i 'd like to buy a few postcards . my sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . i want to do that too .
i agree . they are very lovely especially huan .
well you should say that . the <unk> is much better than the others .
the five dolls are sold together as a set and they 're priced according to the size . the bigger they are the more expensive .
oh i see . if i buy more than a set can i get any discount ?
i do n't think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now .
why do n't you drive to see the refrigerator ?
there are lots of things such as postcards key chains posters and various arts and crafts .
it all sounds great . we can go there after the match . i ca n't wait to see what they have .
i 'm very well .
which is better here or pcc ?
oh i m afraid i don t . i ve never had a holiday in the city but i went on business .
well i like the museums too . they re boring .
it 's not really a bit . but there are many others who do n't want to see .
do n't you see the notes here ?
it 's 150 per hour .
to tell you the truth i do n't like them because they are very fun .
most people do n't know how to help them .
yes . we are a tough team as well . i 'll go to the gym .
i 've bought you a new one last year . is n't it handsome ?
how about a love story then ?
no it 's the first time i 've been here .
have you travelled to many other countries ?
yes . natural pearls or cultured pearls ? we have both kinds .
have you done anything useful in this field ?
i m m serious . i ve been looking for it for quite a long time .
yes . i ve been out of town . there is a few terrible discussion about the sixth of september .
what did you do last night ?
oh i am on a diet . i got to eat a lot of meals and it 's fun .
i love him too . he s a plain jane .

i was skiing on and on excitedly until i realized one thingi could not stop ! you can just imagine how terrified i was .
did you do something wrong ?
he said that i have been in a very good mood .
of course not . i will call you back in a few minutes .
what 's wrong ?
you do n't think it was bad .
i m sorry sir . we ve got a refund .
that 's all right . if you have a good trip i will take you to the hospital .
yes i m in the united states .
how long have you been married ?
yes i did . my family was a little boy .
i was under the circumstances . i could n't find it there .
do you have a fever ?
i m sorry to hear that .
that s normal after a tense work evening . working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . once i worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . that really broke my rhythm and i got a little sick later .
i ll make a list of that we need to get to know .
of course i did !
i remember you are in love .
oh i love you too dad .
it 's greek to me .
so the reform can not be carried out well .
the government is making efforts to change situation .
easier said than done .
he is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
what ? it s only 9 p . m . now . why today he went to bed so early ?
he ran four miles and came back dead beat .
oh i see .
i 'm tired of your cutanddried opinions . who do you think you are !
how dare you speak to me like this .
sorry i did n't . it was not my fault .
i 'm sorry .
it 's ok .
you are so thoughtful .
i feel the same way .
it must be dreadful to grow old .
it sure is . he has no one to turn to very miserable indeed .
have you got a clear answer about him ?
what ? beg your pardon .
john is in prison now . he was copped outstealing .
i just can n't believe my ears !
i ca n't deny that . she is so beautiful that i fell in love with her at the first sight . i wish i knew more about her .
but i heard that she had a threeyearold girl .
i can not belive that . it must be cooked up by someone .
of course i wo n't chill out . opportunity knocks only once .
you should strike while the iron is hot .
you 're right . i will have a talk to her about that .
yes . is everything fine ?
yeah . but his relation with sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife .
he deserved it .
sorry i can t .

i m sorry . i didn t know that .

i m sorry sir . smoking is not permitted in this area .
oh that s a nice idea . well it s fine if you take our picture .

i have to work with you .
well i still have n't finished my christmas shopping . do you want to go shopping with me this weekend ?
not very much . it 's too noisy here . do you ?
now i came back to the hotel and try to show it to my friend the pendant is broken i 'm afraid .
yes i 'd love to .
try to keep cool . it 's not an easy take .
i know . i always hope for the best and prepare for the worst .
then you will be in line for a doom .
i 'm fine . how about you ?
just fine . i 'm going to get my license .
yes i have . i 'm interested in it .
oh my god . in fact there is another thing with my country . in fact i know the general a lot of people just enjoy the big dance floor .
exactly . it usually takes a few minutes to make the first move on .
i want to tell you that i 've been in my life for three years .
i believe it . but we know some of our customers are taking the same language skills as we thought .
i was born and raised in beijing .
definitely . i 've seen that . i remember the first time that i was in a different world . i never thought that maybe i might go .
what about your parents ?
we should n't be here until your scheduled departure time .
it 's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in america .
politics can be a helpful man .
do people get married young ?
how did you do that ?
after all the crises they have survived together her husband should do such things . she s been stabbed in the back .
how awful poor guy .
he s not very active and capable . he s very tall and slim . he s got a face and become very happy with jenny .
yes i know . but i am worried about my work . i 've always been doing some work .
what s that ?
hi hi jim .
i do n't think so .
i 'm ok . i wish i could say the same for my friend .
yes . that is the best one i 've ever seen .
i 've not much . i 've go enough city life in beijing .
yes . i 'm looking forward to it .
ok let 's go .
to call you tomorrow if you have any questions about the plan .
take it easy . i make sure you have to get enough sleep .
take care of yourself .
sure just a moment . . i 'll check to see if he has cleared up .
i 'd like to discuss the new order with you . would you like to have lunch together at garden hotel next tuesday ?
did you have him ?
i ve already voted .
ok ! i 'll just go out with my friends and you 'll have a big dinner party !
well i 'm very sorry to hear that . we could go to the movies . would you like to come with me ?
but i should have aced it . i mean i finished the paper so quickly thinking it 's a piece of cake . but when i knew my result i was like what ? that ca n't be true !
i like the fact that it 's about time but leave it 's on the fourth day .
no . i was thinking of dropping out .
the morning is about 730 pm .
ok . we 'll be expecting you .
what kind of food do you like ?
oh my poor danny sure you are a man . but you know running like this in street is very dangerous .
i m sorry to hear that . stay up . i ll fill you in the form .
oh you 're <unk> ! i 'd love to try something new !
oh come on .
yes we do . that s why we have very much room left . we can share the cost of the whole world from here . we can go to the same beach anytime s to eat .
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
how about this one ? it 's the latest design .
do n't be so sad .
i suggest you lie down for the tv . we have no older brothers on the back .
i see that s fine . what do you have to eat ?
what do you think he can do ?
sure . he once helped him out .
i 'm sorry bob . that 's what i wanted to say yesterday .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
yes but i will not have the slightest idea of it .
i m very fond of you .
are you kidding ? you 're just a little tired .
it is me . i do n't like it either .
i agree . people who are supposed to be able to give you an interview in the morning and if you want to learn something from the country will be the same .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
you can t be serious .
would you like me to go with you ?
i 'd like to but i 'm tied up with my paper .
do you want to type that letter ?
i d rather you typed it .
do you want to tell her ?
i d rather you told her .
yes i 'm going to the cinema dad .
you must n't go to bed very late . can you be home before nine .
oh i wo n't be back so early . the film will be over at nine . can i have the key to the bicycle ?
no . i wo n't let you ride a bicycle late at night .
oh dad i 'm not a child . i 'm 17 already . i 'll come back as soon as the film is over .
ok . here 's the key . take care .
thank you . your room number is 105 . here 's your key and receipt . thank you for choosing our hotel sir .
no i can not .
try to be more careful in future .
it 's okay .
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials ignite it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .
i did n't really like it .
mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
i found it very disappointing .
she liked the acting too because that 's what she wanted to see .
i was n't happy with it .
nothing is to your satisfaction .
never ! he s over 80 isn t he ?
he s nearly 90 .
good gracious ! are you sure ?
i am . whatsmore his wife is 84 .

i feel like having a coke .
yes certainly . how can i help you ?
it 's nice to meet you too .
well we have many friends here . would you like to go to the company with us on friday ?
i think you 're right . let 's take a chance .
hello jack . it 's mary . what are you doing in your office ?
i ve been working too .
what about sunday ? we have got mary and i didn t go to the gym for a lot of work .
tomorrow ? no i 'm afraid i would n't be able to . i 'm going out of the town on business .
i m sorry sir but we are having a sale today . it s going to be a fortune soon .
sorry i never go out on saturday evening . i always watch football on saturday evening .
oh really ? you are so lucky .
next tuesday ? just a moment ! it will be the 21st of may . oh dear . arm . . . i promised my aunt i would be at her birthday party .

let me see . yes mary . let 's make it next wednesday .

you 're welcome . bye .
i 'm very glad to help .

i think i 'll try it .
it s my pleasure . hope you ll visit me again soon .
just a little .
i went to yale university .
did you ? and what did you study ?
i have a b . a . in economics .
would you mind telling me how old you are ?
i 'm twentyseven .
and could you tell me what other jobs you have had ?
yes i have worked in a bank for the last five years .
and what was your salary at the bank ?
i got 500 a week .
thank you . good evening mr . dean .
hi let s see . how s your brother ?
i 'm helen baker .
glad to meet you ms . baker .
glad to meet you too .
where are you from ms . baker ?
i 'm from new zealand .
what do you do for a living ?
i m a teacher .
what do you teach ?
i m going with my friends on friday night but i m really sorry .
what would you like for a drink ?
yes let 's go .
yes why ?
we have a flight that we 'll put you there at ten am . is that ok ?
i d be glad to . what time do you want to come ?
thank you . can i cancel my reservation ?
thank you for your hospitality .
i 'd love to but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
i m sorry to hear that . could you tell me how it was for you ?
it would be good if you could get me there if you would like .
hmm . i ll call you later .
no i have n't but i 've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper .
what kind of job are you looking for ?
either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel .
you have n't had any experience in either of those fields .
i know . but i 'd like to try . look here are some advertisements that i 've cut out .
i was turned down again . it s frustrating . i guess you ve got to teach me some skills .
me ? i m even less experienced than you are .
at least you know what american women generally like in a man .
believe it or not i guess american women like a man in good shape which chinese women may not care about so much . that s my honest opinion . i know you have been trying very hard .
american men are naturally taller than chinese men . so even if i exercise there aren t many chances .
no that s not true . i ve met two american women who were married to chinese . but those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is jacky chan ? he s small and short . but i bet he can have any american woman he wants .
you know that s going to be a tremendous change for me . because i never exercise .
why don t you try then ? even if it doesn t help you find an american girl you could still have a stronger and healthier body . you won t lose anything by doing that .
hi don . what a surprise !
yeah i saw someone walking like you but i wasn t sure . we haven t seen each other for how long ? almost three months ? but you look quite different now .
have you noticed what has changed ?
well as i said i have enough room for the next round .
yes . i m on a diet but i ve not taken anything . i just eat less and exercise more . and it really worked in the past three months . i ve lost twelve pounds .
wow ! that s great . i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals but it s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . also you know old habits are hard to break .
what kind of exercise do you think i do ? i just go to dance everyday after work . i m taking an amateur dance class . i dance two hours everyday .
dance ? you only go dancing ? that s not hard . i can do that .
sure . join my class next week .
hi ! i 'm your personal prejudice . do you know who was the director of the movie titanic ?
ok . and keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over you 'll only have to cook that side lightly . put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese .
i m not going to put a kick in the kitchen and throw a sandwich in the garbage can . what else do you keep up ?
what are the other things like this ?
how about this . let 's get a drink .
ok let 's go .
have you received any training ?
go on . can i help you with that ?
yes i 've been thinking about visiting relatives and a sister in boston .
i 'm afraid not . we 've already gone through our agency .
i know what you mean . i 've seen you try .
no . thanks .
that 's good . the basic deposit box is a little higher . you can get a 20 percent discount on the average rate of the loan .
like what ? i think we should do something exciting .
if i have any other questions how to deal with the law school ?
yes the whole afternoon . my car is n't working .
i do n't think you 're right . i know there are so many people who are n't we ?
this place is full of gas .
but it 's the same in with trees !
i was n't aware of that . i always thought of going to quit .
well why do you want to use a computer ?
whatever you say .
that 's the purpose of the meeting .
haha . that 's not what i meant . look at that it ! they 've got to be able to break into the market .
nothing special .
yes . my passport was in the bag .
sure . i hope it stays nice like this .
well you know it 's a time to get together with all your family and be thankful for everything !
yes that is a big issue . some people have never been to a etv . it 's not a problem or it 's funny for kids to drink .
you know stage is falling apart ! the sand is called a nuclear family .
i 'm a guide to watch the football match . i know more about the world .
wow . no wonder people are so fat .
yes . if you want to put it on your shades .
i 've got the the ticket and i 'll take that one .
according to the magazine it is very similar to global warming .
that is a bank . the gifts are very scenic . i am sorry to have taken your way out .
john john smith the escaped <unk> .
i think it 's time you to get on the right bus .
i 'll take one too .
you have to buy a formal dress next month .
where do you work ?
i 'm afraid i 'm very ill .
it s your mother . and tell me what she would like .
ok i 'll go right now .
25 yuan .
no problem . how much are there in your wallet ?
i don t think that is too much for rent .
i will . thanks for asking me .
i think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you .
ok but how can i know the number of the phone ?
ok . i will pick you up around 6
i 'll be there in time for a dinner party .
yes it was my pleasure . how was it ?
i have a couple of guest passes . you already have to check out your account and company s services . it s no problem for you to contact me .
yep . and she is a good girl .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
oh really ? how can i do that ?
well it 's a monthly salary so you can get a loan on everything you can do for yourself .
it 's already made of pure gold .
it 's made of genuine ivory besides it is of exquisite workmanship . the price is 36 . 00 .
it 's worth seeing . at least the subway station could be used in the long run .
listen here it is . but people should learn something from your work . it is very nice and difficult to deal with .
it 's hard for me to get used to it .
well it 's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . so unfortunately you 'll lose this 50 rib . we 'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .
fortunately it 's not that expensive .
that 's fine . that 's just a little bit of a challenge .
oh no . i 'm afraid i 've had a bad cold . i 'm afraid i 've got to go to a concert .
so you 're leaving so soon ?
i was robbed .
really ? they will be happy .
i know but i do n't have a choice .
did that happen why did n't you just get married ?
i think my greatest accomplishment has been <unk> the hans account .
well i have to drive to school for a meeting this morning and i 'm going to end up getting stuck in rushhour traffic .
well i would never drink alcohol coffee or tea . i heard that you are very good at lifting beer bottles to your mouth .
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
hi mary .
thank you . it s very kind of you .
i had a little trouble with the parents . i didn t know that . a little sad .
as you know we re going to completely different out of my life . i m happy to see you .
okay well it s all about your family on the way to my hands .
that s not a bad idea . we can t do that . why don t you just take a taxi ? it s not a good opportunity .
i found it was quite interesting . the first thing i did was in a bit of a hurry . it s quite simple . i d like to show you how to do it . then you have to do it .
oh yes . there are many houses here .
i know . did you buy anything you wanted ?
it 's a onebedroom onebathroom apartment .
what are you doing ?
you can pick up a few of them .
this is one of the best haunted houses . it s like a set of pure gold .
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a kitchen and a bathroom .
is there a garden in your city ?
i think it s wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event .
i think that they have everything taken care of .
have you got a job ?
when will you give me a raise ?
do you really think so ?
yes i do . if you ask around other people will tell you the same thing .
i think in some way it is an act of god but in another way it just is caused by us .
for example ?
like for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
oh i see . fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things .
really ? that 's a straws in the wind .
i think so . maybe he 's fallen for her .
yeah . they suit each other . a perfect match between a man and a girl .
it 's very nice . it makes me eager to have a chinese restaurant .
oh you were right . . .
you are not kidding ! you are the only one who eat !
thanks . i will do the same .
but chinese food is so delicious . i wish i knew how to cook chinese food .
so what do you eat ?
yes i want to .
thank you ! we will try our best to help you .
i 'm still hungry .
no i 'd rather have the baked fish .
is that a wine ok ?
i like beefsteak very much . have you tried chinese dishes ?
let 's go to see a movie .
but people keep talking about the kids .
yes i know . i will try being a good teacher .
that 's fate .
i feel sorry for her .
maybe this is god 's will .
we have two cleaning ladies . but both of them have received little education .
most cleaning ladies are illiterate . but some of them do a very nice job .
but i actually dislike another lady . she is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . but the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . she would tell you what to do and where to put things .
well i am a little bit out of shape . i think i should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ?
i 'd better exercise my body too . my limbs are rusty now .
your daughter is a wonderful student .
we get a master card and visa .
how can i exercise my body too ?
well we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . the trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the workout plan .
what else ?
since everyone is different your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . then you 'llbe taught all the necessary techniques to us
sounds pretty good . i think i will work hard on my job . thanks for the position .
it 's 150 yuan for each person .
perhaps one month . i 'll just have a try at first .
maybe you 're right . but i still have to watch my calories .
yes . i like gardening .
oh that s interesting and but what kind of things do you learn ?
several things for example various coins stamps stones and so on .
stones ? i know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?
oh yeah . many people go out to the state of china and buy video stores .
well i can t just image it .
i 'm doing great .
thanks professor . see you again .
i 'm just glad it 's over .
so what have you been to do ?
yes it is . some ring tone is very nice and you know how to arrange it for us .
hi . i 'm just calling to get back to you about this this .
so how about going to a concert ?
oh it 's been uh . . .
i will .
you mean stuff like tampons and sanitary napkins ?
really ? i ca n't wait to see it .
did you get your tefl certificate ?
i like bowling .
i would love it if you did n't .
what 's wrong ?
oh that 's pretty bad . what do you think about her as the one ?
do n't worry . just make sure you do n't have to worry about it .
i like spring because i like spring .
how about playing tennis ?
yes the weather sure is nice today .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is so nice .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
great ! that 's the way i 'm going to do it .
i know chinese better than this . and i also like pop music . you see that we have to do some excellent things .
i ca n't believe i would !
i ca n't wait to see you .
i took a training course and i am quite good at english so i have passed and enjoyed reading maps .
do you have a copy of your resume ?
yes . if you want to know the cost of the country we are not familiar with american universities .
well i 've never had one that way . i was thinking of going out to a small party so i decided to go out and watch tv .
that s why i should go to the english class .
yes it is . but i work hard all day long .
i 've been having a big sale so i guess i 'm going to quit soon .
what 's your favorite ?
yes . i had a meeting with a terrible headache .
are the plane on schedule ?
well i want to study in the future . i love studying literature and i think i m going to be a good student .
if you want to be an english teacher you should do everything you can to keep learning and understand what you are doing .
that 's right . you 're such a good catch . it 's really important to us .
sounds like you have a very good chance .
ok i will .
it 's interesting . can you tell me the exact difference between it ?
oh yes . it 's an excellent question . well i have n't seen the previous star in the opening day . we 've heard that the ancient chinese people were pleased with that . it 's a bit tight schedule . do you think we have a different musical bracelet ?
i am not sure . let 's make it the time .
sure . but you know that i ca n't read any chinese characters . what do they say ?
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
it 's interesting and i want to buy one home .
yes it sure is . it has a special one but it has a reality view .
yes it sure is . they like this one .
how about a permanent one ? this is the latest model .
sure . i 'll have a look at the others .
they are popular in a type of position that can give people a very good taste and they do n't care less about the stuff .
you 've got a lucky dream . have you been here with your parents ?
how many days i 'll be out of my schedule ?
yes i have some will . i want to graduate school in the evenings .
is there a isn t anything on sale for my house ?
did you get your tefl certificate ?
that 's a lot of work .
i think the price is very reasonable .
okay i 'll take the one .
sure . have you ever watched garlic before ?
that 's a good idea .
yes . they are very similar in both ways . then a couple of different people have different tastes . would you like to learn something about your new job ?
i 'll tell you what kind of store you want . do you have it ?
they do n't really fit you right .
i do wish i could lose weight . what 's your favorite color ?
they do a good job . there are food that hurts .
ok ! i can smell the hickory chips ? they give the expert to the camera a big one .
well i have got you three first class tickets and i have reserved your seats . your seat numbers are 8a 8b and 8c .
so why not ? they are my kids alex and family . .
i ca n't agree with you .
do they do a good job on the food ?
i know . i 'll take it .
they do n't have a good attitude to be healthy .
yes i can . i heard that there are many kinds of animals in the world . we never know where people get killed . but i like the hang around a group of people .
toys ? why do we need toys for a picnic ?
yeah ! i never knew anything .
yes . there is one on the other side of the zoo .
could i have a fresh towel ?
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
yes . that s a good idea .
well in the beginning of the first two to be punctual . one day after the first two hours of september . but the brochure said the information is that the high season after the first time of the first two or three .
you know i know . but we 're busy are n't we ?
yes . then you can send email to each other every day .
i see . so the bus does n't work .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
yeah . i know ! but what do you want to know ?
yes it is . i like the writer 's language too .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i 'll pick you up at about 600 .
me too . it 's a good idea to do some things on the weekend .
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
i m sorry i can t . i ve had a date already .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
i like all sorts of movies primarily drama and science fiction .
well there 's nothing good at all . the problem is that i do n't care what i wanted and i do n't have any depth .
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
yes i do . i have n't think we need to be able to come down and talk to our boss .
i think tom might have been nominated for one of his films but i do n't think he won anything .
that 's it . who won ?
how about taking a walk in the park ?
yes . it 's time to get here .
ok hold it . remember to be punctual next time
look at that big tree over there .
oh my god ! it s still there . we have our first date right on there .
i 'm sorry . i 'll get it right away .
you were the first time in the city .
but i just do n't like it .
smile i can t believe this for it s been 20 years since we got married .
ok i 'll check for the information .
sure . but i think the color is even the most beautiful .
oh you mean all that money we have the same question . what 's the movie about ?
thanks . have you heard the movie yet ?
i 've got a point . one of the stars come here . com contract is for three shifts .
what other kind of food do you like ?
oh really ? i m not sure about it .
i hope you can make it .
but i am afraid it 's too formal .
that 's not bad . let 's take a look at the others before you make a decision .
sure . here it is i think .
it 's a good movie .
it 's our new musical . i 'm going to start at the beach .
ok just go through the number eight to ticket barrier over there . a few people are from the highway to the great wall .
who do you like the song ?
but he is not a fine wether friend who could sell you down the river .
what color are her eyes ?
did she tell you when she saw her in person ?
it 's martin <unk> .
kobe is a good player .
you mean he is also a hard worker . he is surely to know the trust of his team .
he knows that his name is product and its content is the most favorable .
i usually have the wrong notion that he 's very serious .
there s so much i want to do . i ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . i just ran a search for music to download .
i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
thanks . that would be very helpful . i ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . there s too much information on the net .
when you sent your emails did you attach any files to them ?
yes i did . there s an antivirus programme with my email account that <unk> all attachments so i m sure i haven t sent anything nasty to anyone .
when you use the internet be careful not to give out your email address very often . if you do you might get a lot of <unk> email form companies trying to sell you things .
that s good advice . i should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself such as my password and credit car number .
that s right . another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time
how do i do that ?
take your used textbooks with you and give them to the representative near the entrance . he will pay you for them . are you going today ?
that s useful to know . i ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .
really ? i m not sure that i would like all the attention . there have been numerous cases of paparazzi <unk> with star s private live in recent years .
i love being <unk> ! if i were famous i d do interviews for all the top magazines like cosmo and elle .
i wouldn t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice but it would get tedious after a while . imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you .
noone really believes gossip columnists .
i think you should be very careful with that . in other words you might as well as a matter of what they are . don t be careful about anything that you might happen .
i think you re right about that . i d need a good manager to be my <unk> . i could do a lot of charity work which would help a lot of people .
that s a great idea . which charities would you support ?
i love children as you know so probably a children s charity .
you d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity so you d really need to be very careful . anyway i d be the first to buy your posters and i d attend your first book
thanks but actually i am not sure i could do it .
yes it is . thanks . i m just surfing on the internet .
do you have a surfboard ?
this cafe offers a wireless internet connection . that means i can get on the net for free while i m here . of course i have to buy a cup of coffee !
that s great . can you do it anywhere ?
you can come back this afternoon and i 'll show you how to use the atm .
so what programs do you have on your laptop ?
i ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs .
i know you are keen on photography . it s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone anywhere at a
there it s too much information on the computer . i can t send the fax to anyone . it gives me a lot of information but i need to do it .
yes i do . i also use an antispyware program and a firewall . there are so many <unk> on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . you have to be very c
how often do you run your antivirus program ?
i usually run it every few days . it finds a virus about half the time .
which antivirus program would you recommend ?
have you tried this one ? it s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . you can also download updates for free .
that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ?
just a minute . . . go to this one . i ll send you an email with the line in it . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the set up procedures . but they are not complicated .
what do you use your computer for ?
i use it for several thingssurfing the net word processing and creating presentations . i don t play many games on my computer but i do a lot of work with photographs . using a computer program you
computers are great aren t they ? i should download some programs and learn how to use them .
i use it almost every day but i usually only use it to check my email . i don t often surf the net . you use the internet a lot don t you ?
yes . i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . it can be frustrating when the connection is poor .
so you re online eight hours a day .
yes i like the job though . sometimes i help other people in the office if they re having trouble online .
how do you solve the website for the internet ?
i think it s fairly useful but there are two big problems . first a lot of the information you find online is false . second when you buy something online you don t see it until you actually get it .
how do you solve the website problems when you re buying something online ?
what i do is find the website of shops . then someone from our company <unk> the shop and buys when they re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .
i d say the main reason is poverty . countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . if their neighbors have some resources they try to steal them by military force .
it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end .
how do you think they could be ended ?
i do n't think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate .
so if the cause is poverty there should be a program to make the country richer . if the problem is resources share them .
it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality it 's harder to make peace between countries .
yes . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .
the problem is that many poor people might suffer .
would you like to live in the country ? i m not sure i d like it .
i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that for me each advantage has its own disadvantage .
i see . you have been pretty hard to double without sex and violence .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
i couldn t agree with you more .
people can t have it both ways . if you live in the country it is often less convenient . if you live in a city it is noisy buy there s more to do .
i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they re so much better to look at than concrete rows of parked cars and tall buildings .
i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . when the wind blows in the city you get dust in your eyes and in your eyes .
the view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . there s so sign of pollution . the village looks so peaceful .
just remember that in that village there s nothing to do . there s not even a pub or restaurant . there s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .
you re right . i would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . i would hate living in the country !
of course i do .
i m sorry . there are so many left now .
he s not his fault .
i agree . we ll give you a 10 discount in the country . if you were to a country it would be too late .
yes it probably is . you ve got to turn it off if you do n't mind . think of the mobile phone and other resources you can t see the fax machine . if you have any question you can t see the fax machine .
so shall we have a rest here ? shall we sign a contract and let the contract ?
like for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
have you booked the tickets for the concert halls in your city ?
why not ! it s a classic in fact it s one of my favorite novels .
but it s so old .
don t judge a book by its cover . do you kwon what it s about ?
i usually only have a few pounds of time . but i only have a few if i m taking a long time .
if you have any questions about the jobs you may take as you are interested .
i didn t realize it was a romance novel . what s the main storyline ?
it s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .
why does he want to do that ?
since he doesn t have a son he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . that way all of his daughters will be cared for .
won t they get his inheritance ?
no that s the problem . though they are welloff once he dies his house will go to his cousin . so when he dies the girls will have nothing .
i see . this sounds interesting ! maybe my teacher isn t so horrible after all .
so are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
there s movie ? my teacher didn t tell me that !
that s probably because she wants you to read the book first .
it would take a lot less time . .
how about this . when you finish the book . i ll get the movie and watch it with you .
ok . that sounds like a deal .
i only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . i don t think that tv is bad for kids . i think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes .
perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first .
if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch remember to have something else for them to do . if you don t they ll get bored and misbehave .
could you go out with their friends and play with their friends ?
sure . you could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time .
perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . he watches too much tv too .
that s a good idea . remember that if the parents watch too much tv the kids will probably follow suit .
i like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . but i don t like traveling to work waiting for buses or . .
or getting stuck in traffic jams when you re driving .
i think that something must be done .
it 's gone with the wind .
why do you like it best ?
i enjoy the various characters and the plot .
well . i like the thorn birds best .
is it very interesting ?
sure . i like the writer 's language too .
if i have a chance i 'll enjoy the book .
would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
that 's a good idea . let s go !
it 's the best seller everyone 's been talking about for the last six months .
how in the world did you get a copy ? i 've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i 'm still waiting my turn .
i checked it out of the rental library . it only costs five cents a day .
is it really worth paying for ?
i ca n't tell yet . i have n't got beyond the first chapter .
if it 's any good i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
not a great deal .
i 've just been reading an article about them . they ll be used for all sorts of things now .
for accounting system and things like that you mean ?
yes but they are used for other things too . do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to paris .
yes ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
ok but do n't forget to put him in .
i know that . all of them were trying to give their money to help him .
oh it is a nice day . i do n't feel like it .
i hope you have a good relaxation and come back in a week .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
you can give it a break .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
i can read the subtitles . my set is a hugescreen one .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
oh what s he like ?
well he s got dark hair and brown eyes .
yes he s not tall maybe he s got light blond .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
really ? i like playing basketball .
yes but he s got a wife and 3 children as well .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .
what happened ? you look so pale .
it 's the end of the world for me .
what makes you say that ?
i do n't see anything wrong with what we 're doing ! that 's just the problem . in these kind of things the trouble does n't always appear at first .
oh that 's too bad . work harder next term .
b i 'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me .
do n't lose heart . everything will be fine .
thank you very much . you ve been very helpful .
yes of course . this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
i m glad you re enjoying it .
thank you for the invitation .
it s my pleasure . can i get you another glass of champagne ?
i just had enough . you re a big drinker .
sorry i can t .
tomorrow night then ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
that s sounds great .
ok . how about give me a ring then ?
no . i d better not .
how come ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i m looking at my horoscope for this month ! my outlook is very positive . it says that i should take a vacation to someplace exotic and that i will have a passionate summer fling !
what are you talking about ? let me see that . . . what are <unk> ?
it s a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign . you have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . i was born on april 15th so i m an aries . when were you born ?
january 5th .
let s see . . . you re a capricorn . it says that you will be feeling stress at work but you could see new exciting developments in your love life . looks like we ll both have interesting summers !
that s bogus . i do n't feel any stress at work and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
no it s not your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . see ? it s time when you play the game of your personality .
well you certainly match those criteria but they re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ?
a capricorn is <unk> and practical . she likes to do things in conventional ways . that sounds just like you !
ok ! how about <unk> ?
no no no a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . i m going to describe someone s face and you guess who it is !
ok !
let me put your cases into the trunk and please get in the back .
our cousin pete ! my turn ! she has a <unk> nose <unk> eyes and a mole on her chin !
aunt rose ! that mole is so huge ! ok my turn . he has a crooked nose and full lips . he has quite a few freckles and an oval face . oh he is also bald !
your future husband !
not funny .
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
mumm . no .
it s only the day when the world s biggest sporting event is kicking off .
it s not like my parents want to live in the city . they re like a big party .
i do n't have health insurance .
i have no idea what you re talking about . the only sporting event we watch at home is the super bowl .
this is bigger than the super bowl man ! teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . they first start in a group stage with bigger groups each g
sounds interesting but soccer doesn t really appeal to me .
are you kidding ? over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup ! it s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! each nation is cheering on their team hoping they will bec
all i know about soccer is that you can t use your hands and that players are always falling down trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . it seems like a sissy sport to me !
whatever i m going to go watch the opening match .
mine was ok except that no one in my class speaks english . i guess it will force me to <unk> in chinese more in class so at least i should improve a lot this semester .
that s both fortunate and unfortunate . it s the united nations in my class ! we have people from all over the world ! there are three germans a pole a scottish two french an american a brazilian
that s right . he s a very famous aunt in the united states and he s got a famous country in the field .
well i think you re pretty lucky actually . you ll have the opportunity to learn so much about asian culture .
i guess so but i think it s going to be hard to relate to my classmates especially with the language barrier . i think i might change classes .
don t ! stay the course ! your spoken chinese will be eternally grateful . i bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice .
i highly doubt it . your girlfriend is chinese .
well there is that yes .
it s nice that the sun is driving usually over the city . i don t know if it s nice but how does it look like the perfect spot ! ok kids put on your sunscreen while your mom and i set up ca
there we go . can you help me with the umbrella ? perfect .
ok kids here <unk> beach ball and a frisbee a pail and a shovel . i want to see an impressive <unk> by the time we leave . don t stray too far . wait ! leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes
and stay in the shallow area . i don t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! it s too deep out there and we didn t bring your floatier .
you re back already ? the water was too cold huh ? i ll tell you a secret . do you see that small pool of water over there ? it ll be warmer in there . go see if you can find some seashells or catch some
is that a color ? you look so down the track of what you blow up ?
ah ! not on me ! ow !
i want to think of it for some time .
i m sure he would .
what are you talking about ? it is a lot of money !
hmm . i m sorry to hear that ! sounds like you didn t come to a party !
she is a teacher in a <unk> she teaches chinese .
well i m not working on it . it s just a question of my job as we know .
no one thousand at least .
what kind of <unk> are you going to look for ? i have a friend that we are looking for anyone to get married and how about going for a while . the club in my opinion each g
yes it does look a bit sore . let 's take your extra way of your chest and give you a few tests .

oh while we 're on the subject what happened to you and your secretary ?
well i hope we can t have any problems in this area .
that s right . your company has been raised for 7 years and you ve got to be joking ! it s not the company s day and there s still a chance to put in and you ll be so particular that s about what i was looking for .
you re so lucky ! that s what i asked for . anything else ?

i was robbed .
ben we re fifteen . what kind of job are you looking for ?
oh just for a position as a gas station attendant . you know starting at a simple lowly job just like all the greats before they made it big in the world .
i do n't think it is right . but i have to admit it 's easier said than done .

yeah ? you finally decided to wipe the slate clean ?
you got it ! i have a new job i m living in a new city with new friends ! this is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way i live my life .
so what are you going to do ? take up an art class or something ?
well first of all i ve decided to stop smoking . it s not that i m pinching pennies or anything it s just that i ve been smoking since i was sixteen and i think it s time to stop .
i m with you on that one . anything else you re planning on doing ?
one last thing i ve decided to come out of the closet .
it s about time !
thanks . i really appreciate it .
i can t bear it ! i m not going to quit my job until i m going to move around and talk to my skills .
well i hope you don t have enough cash to lose your job . we ve got you shopping in one month s going to lose your job .
yeah it would be nice to see you .

yes that s true . what did you do ?
i 'd like a gin and tonic .
do you want to take milk and sugar with that ?
i 'm waiting for someone .
i think i 'll take three .
i am glad you like it .

oh yeah . i went out with her yesterday . she was a cd evening . we both both love and the same thing .
i 'll be there .
well she s out of my league . it s her nose . i m sure she is a nice girl .
wow ! this sounds like something my wife would really enjoy ! are you serious ? how does it look ?
of course but i m not happy about it .
i think that 's life is much better than anyway .
george how can we ? vacations cost money . and this month we don t have much money left after paying the rent .
well lili we can visit different places in the state in our van . we are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . trust me it won t cost much .
where will we sleep then ?
how about bill 's seafood ?
what about other expenses ?
let s see . gas food recreation we won t spend much . come on . don t hesitate . we need to get out of the house once in a while . we have been working hard haven t we ?
yes it s a common practice to make sure we keep ourselves . we can t just use it .
the sooner the better ! i can t wait !
oh i don t know where we re going .
as long as we re going you can decide where to go . i trust your <unk> . i know you miss chinese food so we can eat at a chinese restaurant this time .
let s go to chicago . we can have lunch in chinatown . then we can go to a ball game at <unk> field !
that sounds great . let s go !
i found the ideal position . i m working for a plumbing company .
are you serious ? you studied mathematics at college for four years and now you have a job working with your hands !
plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge and creativity . i love this job .
i can see that . but i didn t know you had experience in that line of work .
i didn t but i applied for an apprenticeship and since i studied math and i have a good attitude 4 my application was accepted .
congratulations ! you do have the right attitude .
did you have to take a medical before you could take out the police ?
i will call you when a computer is free .
it s a beautiful summer holiday . we can sit in the sun and sit down .
do n't be so modest . i 'm sure you can do it very well . then we can meet you at the gate of the table .
well we could take a cut on the line if you want to do that .
how about your spanish ?
i m very good at tennis and i enjoy both playing and watching .
i can t remember . i m a terrible team player .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
i have been playing it for the past few years .
do you mind if i read your books ?
i think i 'm a basketball fan .
cool exercise !
i know it s going to be a good thing i m taking it again .
but i m not able to learn it very often .
no it 's definitely the original problem .
it 's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future .
oh you mean palm reading . i 've seen that before but i do n't believe in it .
are you sure ? i 've read a lot about it ?
really ? you 've read books about it ? ok then . but only if you want to .
ok let 's see well you 've got a long life line which is good and the love line is strong . .
what else do you see ? will i be successful ? will i make a lot of money ?
hmm hard to say wait yes it looks like you will do well in business and your ambition will help you a lot but . .
i think you are right . all the documents are for themselves . but you know we are working together at the moment .
i 'm sorry to say that we have to let you go john .
exactly . it seems that the boss should be done by it .
no not really . why do you ask ?
i want to make sure i bring enough money for my date and i .
you saw a ghost ? when ?
it was many years ago when i was a little child . it was the middle of the night and i went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . i walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs when . . .
so that 's where you saw the ghost ? in your house ? what did it look like ? was it hideous ?
it was a big green thing that looked like a person . it was in the kitchen and it slowly moved towards the stairs . .
so what did you do ?
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
until what ? what happened ? did you see it clearly ? did it attack you ?
it moved slowly up the stairs step by step and i could hear its approaching footsteps . when it finally got to the top of the stairs i realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . he had gone to get a late night snack .
i just found out that my husband is cheating on me .
you mean mark ? he seems like such an honest guy .
that 's what i thought . it seems that he 's been seeing someone else for about two months .
you 're right . how did you know ?
i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . i picked it up and a girl asked to talk to mark . she then asked if i was his sister and i said no i was his wife . she hung up immediately .
so you asked him about the girl who called ?
yeah he first said it was someone from work . he gave me a lame excuse and so i pressed him on it .
maybe he 's a little too old . we 'd better grab a little oil and a little oil .
he kept trying to make stupid excuses and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion .
how could you tell me something about his creation ?
you see !
you can say that again . it s not just your fault .
i love that idea . i ve always been into group of people . i think i d be better not .
i think you 're doing a good job .
me too . i like the story i am not a child .
you ve been working too hard you know what ? you don t have to be angry with your friends !
that s why i m here for the japanese section .
what other kind of people do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
do you have any other safety features ?
yeah . they do the same thing . but you should learn it first .
i see . well it s not like that . it s a good idea to relieve stress as well . and you should also get some exercise every day you need to learn something from your colleagues .
me too . i ca n't wait to see the sun and fight this time .
not much .
well sounds interesting . but i think the thing is that there is n't a hot restaurant in the corner . what would you like to see ?
yes i 've got a look at the boxes . i 'd like to get a free table if you 've got a friend .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh i will try my best . but what do you think it is wrong with it ?
come on ! a tour of the city is really beautiful . but you need to go to the mountains with us . it 's good for your health .
i know you have the concert hall . how about the concert hall ?
what is he doing ?
how do you want it ?
i 'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments .
tell me if you need help .
no i am not eating there anymore . i have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . the food served in the cafeteria is not my type . i am a total meat lover . but the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . they have been serving the chinese cabbage and
that s fine with me . i don t hate vegetables and i don t eat much during lunch .
well then the cafeteria suits you best . but anyway if you like to have a lunch outside the company feel free to join me anytime .
i 'm going to graduate this summer .
what school are you going to ?
i 'm planning to return to china after graduation .
why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad .
well i think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment .
yeah china 's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country .
of course ! it is the no . 1 <unk> in my life . you know job stress has become a very common problem these days . so we must learn to cope with it .
totally agree . what is your solution ?
well there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress both we and the companies should do something . for me i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know all work and no play make jack a dull boy .
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
but i don t think we can change our working condition . anyway we are not the bosses .
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
he must have been really angry about it .
an impressive officer is vital to the image projected by the company .
they had no reason for arresting me .
that will certainly be a very expensive meal but what else do you have to pay ?
what about the senior account managers ? do they count ?
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
well i hope it all goes well .
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .
yes next march .
you mean that i am not the only one who had the best choice ?
you mean that we can not make a big one ?
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
i never know that . i do n't know what to do first . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i enjoy the various characters and the plot .
toss a coin to decide then .
bye jason .
i know . but this is my first time to get to work .
i have a boarding pass .
your usual shirt and shoes .
it 's not the right color .
i know . i will get all that around with my friends .
i like the design but do n't particularly care for the colour . do you have that in other colours too ?
i agree i had the food there last week .
so what were you calling me about ?
you are always so hospitable .
i 'm serious .
all right . next time you will treat .
i think it 's a favorite .
yes there is a western dish in it .
you mean a lot ?
i 'll take it .
i went to that restaurant last night .
i think i 'm afraid i 'm not interested in fashion .
follow me into the kitchen . you will love it .
i hate to exercise but i think it 's bad for your health .
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .
i do n't want to be silly !
i had my first cigarette when i was 17 .
yeah that would be nice .
i was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked where is your home ?
ok . i 'll call her later .
supervisor . open the door .
no problem . i 'll give you your receipt and i 'll take care of it .
and i can do it very well .
yes sir . i 'll be right back .
oh my god ! i ca n't help it .
good idea .
i would n't mind a burger .
fine thanks .
sorry i do n't think i 'm going to the gym . i 'm not going to be able to do some exercise . i 'm too tired .
well that would be great ! thanks for your help !
yes it is . but it 's very fresh and the tango is so fresh .
hey do n't be so sure . you can really go for a walk in the mountains !
really ? what did he say ?
then he must be in a very big fan of him .
i thought he was too big to play with a bunch of hands .
what 's the matter with you ?
that 's great !
are you busy on the 24th ?
oh i have a class on the last day . i have no idea where to find these are .
you are right . what about shoes ?
you can take it back to me and i 'll speak to someone else .
oh i see . so what do we do after that ?
i thought you had trouble with clive !
i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics
i prefer summer especially the summer evenings . when the sun comes down it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . after a rain shower the smell of the air is refreshing . it is also a best reason for icecream .
how do you get through the stuffy daytime ?
well i have to hide in the airconditioned rooms . anyway it is all worth just think about the cool evening time .
fantastic ! i enjoy clubbing especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad full of smoke and the music is too loud so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
how did that happen ?
his car was hit by an express train . it happened at the crossing just behind his house .
sounds cool ! but that is not what a lady should do . people are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk .
oh that sounds great !
but today is friday . you are not going to work overtime on friday evening are you ?
i want to get a promotion in the job .
sorry i was not a dancer . i am a member of the gym .
why do n't you speak english ?
our school did . they played really well .
what was the score ?
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
wonderful !
anne ! i have n't seen you for ages . how 've you been ?
fine just fine . and you ?
quite well thank you .
i just got back from london .
better take the subway . it s faster and more convenient .
en where do we pay the fares ?
we have a rather comprehensive subway system here . you can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy .
where do we pay the fare ?
just give the man sitting there three yuan and he 'll give you a ticket .
oh i see . by the way how can i get out of the platform after i get off the train ?
cash credit card or debit card ?
well you can take the no . 36 bus from here but you have to walk about 30 minutes .
i 'm afraid i ca n't find the way to get there .
no you do n't have to . here comes the train . be careful ! subway doors open and close automatically .
is that so ? i did n't know it . can i possibly borrow a jacket and a tie ?
i am sorry you ca n't borrow a jacket and a tie .
then we 'll return to the hotel and come back will you change the appointment ?
certainly what time will you come back ?
would you like to go to dinner or something ?
ok great should i bring anything ?
three . two adults and one kid .
i 'm sorry i was n't able to fall asleep .
er . . . hum . . . got it .
then open that window . yeah that one .
right !
and that 's it . you 're done .
i see what you mean . that was pretty easy after all .
no please feel free .
oh your seat is at 90 .
you 're welcome . and if you need any other things please let us know .
he said that he s the boy who s been trying to help him .
i just lost my job . my boss just told me .
that 's unbelievable . why did this happen ?
i do n't understand of myself . it seems they have to save money .
i cant't believe it . you 've worked here for years .
well we 'll both have to do some things and then go out for dinner .
see you on the line .
right . the bus tour is really worth while .
ok . let s go .
no i ve t discussed it . i think i need it .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
i just don t want to play table tennis any more .
emm . . . yes . but i was n't too impressed . i found her a little stuck up .
you are kidding but she 's so helpful .
tom . . . . you are her boss you down . of course she 's helpful to you .
come on . she 's like that with everyone .
i do n't think so actually . she never even says hello to me .
yes she is my first sister .
that 's too bad . what problems are you having .
oh the whole house needs repainting for starters . the carpet in the living room is worn out and i 'd like to put in new walltowall carpeting . last week i had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . anyway all par for the course when you own a house i guess . i think i am going to hire an interior <unk> to look the place over .
i 've studied home decoration as a hobby . could i make some suggestions ?
go right ahead .
i like what i see .
wow you really have a talent for this alice . thanks for the suggestions .
you are welcome . please have a seat .
i wonder if you can change it .
i see . well generally speaking we could talk about the safety manual of our company .
yes the film was quite relaxed . . . i thought the movie was too good .
but people have contributed to the situation as we have to give each other .
hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?
hi !
pleased to meet you . my name is alice . did you just move in next door ?
yes i did . have you lived here long ?
me ? i guess so . i 've lived here for about six years now . have you lived in america very long ?
no not really . when i left vietnam i came to america and i lived with a cousin in dallas for two years . where do you work alice ?
i teach mathematics at a college . what do you do ?
i am an accountant at a company .
well tom . it 's good to meet you . i have to go now . i am teaching a class this evening and i need to get to the college .
it 's nice meeting you too alice .
see you around !
goodbye alice .
thank you . it 's a pleasure to meet you .
the same for me .
thank you they are beautiful .
yes but i 've tried diets before .
do n't worry . i will find a suitable job .
oh i see . but i did n't think about anyone !
here 's a present for you .
oh it 's no use complaining . if you had got enough money we would n't be able to get it done .
it 's a bad habit . i ca n't sleep well .
i would love to see the doctor . it s very nice to see you . you know i can fix your documents . it s very nice to see the doctor .
do you like it ?
very well . i will be sure to take your advice . how about 130 pm ?
did you enjoy it ?
yes . i ve tried . but americans like butter bread sugar and cream too much .
it 's the end of the world for me .
did you have something on your mind ? you look so concerned ! maybe i can help you .
well i 'm always learning the economics on my own . i 'm very sorry .
is there anything i can do for you ?
yes . i am looking for a cap . size 16 .
nothing serious . my stomach is bothering me .
what tooth is it ?
no he did n't hurt me .
how ? a surprise ! it 's just a piece of cake . you 'll love it .
i was there for almost a year .
all right !
i 'm glad you 're so kind .
well . i have to go to the dentist . it s the police station . you have to go to the dentist .
no but we do n't have a big bonus .
yeah the government really takes a bite doesn t it ?
yes it is . the security there is so many cars .
i guess the same .
absolutely . you can wait for hours with the exchange rate .
yeah . i 'm not going to start it off while the first two months . is that true ?
let s just hope the politicians don t figure out a way to spend it .
really ? i think they 'd better have that <unk> on the internet .
no but that was a random change of subject .
yes i love it . did you like the acting ?
i used to be a part of the country but i was n't able to see the results .
of course not . but i will be able to see you tomorrow .
ok . does your present employer know that you are going to leave ?
laura .
do you like this place ?
i don t think it s very nice . and my father doesn t like it . but my mother likes it very much . so we often come here .
how often ?
three times a year at most . how do you feel about this ?
who s that ?
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
do you like swimming ?
yes . swimming is one of my most favorite sports indoors or outdoors .
i like it very much but my father has a bit of work .
you look quite confident in your work .
let me take it up with all the appliances .
yes i once booked a job in the job . now that you can ask for your best job .
well i 'm looking for a job so i can recommend it .
sounds like you 've got a good idea . you must be aware of that .
well i ve been out of town and i m waiting for a while . my parents s out to the town .
i m free tomorrow afternoon . i ll be glad to help .
ok . . . i m serious .
i think you are right .
actually i do n't know what to get .
ok . i 'll have the bread .
i 'll have a glass of water .
thank you . i 'll bring your order right away .
i 'll have steak medium rare .
i love your job .
i like beer .
i have no champagne right now .
they sell them well .
where shall we sit ?
i have n't decided yet .
could n't be better .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
you need to put your name at the bottom .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
ok i 'll be right back .
i grow a variety of things so that something is in bloom all year round .
when is your garden at its best ?
it looks best in spring when the plum and cherry blossoms are out .
i 'm going to travel by bus .
i hope i don t ever see you back in here .
i have n't decided yet .
how long will you be there ?
medicine . in my country i think the best way are for studying .
the sales department is different this morning . i m a little nervous at first .
tasha mountain ? it 's really very famous in china is n't it ?
one way .
my house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture .
no wonder you look so upset . have you called the police ?
yes he was taken this book by the police . he was there .
i know . i like it but i do n't like it . i 'm sure you will enjoy it .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
i love the museums too . did you know anything about the actress ?
where can we sing ?
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
that 's exactly exciting .
yes the weather sure is nice today .
what 's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
it 's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there 's a chance of freezing rain .
that does n't sound pretty .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
well i was going to drive to birmingham to see some friends .
you might want to change your plans . with the cold and wet weather that we 're supposed to have tomorrow the roads are going to be rather slippery .
i suppose i should . i do n't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
i just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
if you 're lucky it 'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !
if that happens then i 'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
that sounds like fun .
you ll have to buy your own ticket though .
english weather is even more predictable than i had previously thought .
hi susan . how are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
i did n't know you were lucky enough !
he 's over sixty .
well wish him a happy birthday for me .
sure thing . what are your plans for the evening ?
i was just thinking of going to a movie tonight .
well if you can wait until tomorrow night i 'll go with you then .
sorry i 've got people coming over tomorrow night .
it 's been a lot of work .
sounds that way . maybe some other time then ?
sure . hey i 'm sorry but i 've got to get going .
yeah me too . it 's about time i made a move .
oh come on . i will be back as early as possible .
well i can say that again .
'm doing my best .
it 's beethoven . do you like it ?
i think beethoven's music is incredible . i 've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent too . do you believe that ?
i do n't know about that but i do think that it helps people relax .
what other kind of music do you listen to ?
actually i mostly just listen classical music . what about you ?
to be honest i think classical music is too complicated for me .
what kind of music do you prefer then ?
i like classical music . do you ?
not really . i do n't think pop music has much depth .
i see what you mean . i think that 's way i like it so much .
how long have you been in to pop music then ?
i 've always been into it . have you always liked classical music ?
not really . when i was little we did n't really listen to music at all .
so how did you become interested in it ?
well when i was about 10 years old i started playing the piano . i think that 's how it all started .
do you still play piano ?
yes it 's one of my hobbies .
what kind of movie is it ? i don t like many of his movies actually .
it s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead .
i like thrillers and i like julia roberts so it might be interesting . i read a review today and the critic didn t seem to be very impressed .
what did the critic say ?
he didn t say it was bad but he said that it wasn t as good as it could have been particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it .
the movie starts at eight o clock so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
good . dinner is nearly ready and i d like to watch the news before we go . the oscars were last night and i want to see the results .
i won t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . there were a few surprises .
i think i have the favorite basketball golf clubs .
i like those kinds of programs too . they re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
i agree . people often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence .
yeah . and that s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !
right . you can t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . they need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs .
in my country there s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . i think it s about six minutes per hour .
that s great idea . but don t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?
no . they don t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ?
not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! that s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv where you pay a fixed amount each month .
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country but people don t seem to keen to pay for their tv programs . besides the <unk> channels offer a good range of programs .
i see . the news says that there are often stamped and people get high marks by watching a football match . the government has a low end .
it s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . i play the part of the detective . he has to catch the killer but there s very little evidence . it s a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes but i hope audience won t be too scared to go to the movie theatres !
did you enjoy making the movie ? we heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director .
i have had disagreement with every director . i ve worked with . we ve always <unk> in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . it was the same when i made this movie . i don t know where <unk> of my disagreement with rachel kelly come from . we got on very well and i hope to work with her again . i enjoyed making the movie very much .
have you ever heard that movie making the movie ? i thought you might have got an interview in the movie .
not at all . the feedback from audience has been great . i care about what they think more than what they think . the critics think more than girls think .
did you do you own stunts in the movie ?
i wanted to but my insurance company wouldn t let me . all of my stunts were done by a <unk> . as you know i used to do my own stunts but i ll leave that to the experts in future .
thank you very much for doing this interview .
my pleasure . have you seen the movie yet ?
yes . i have . i liked it very much . like you i was very impressed with rachel s performance in the movie . she s going to be a star .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
yes i experienced one when i was in tokyo once . the tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over .
do you know where it measured on the richter scale ?
i do n't remember but it was n't very serious . have you ever been in an earthquake ?
no but i was in quite a few tornados when i was younger .
where are you from ?
i 'm from the plains of the midwest . it 's a prime location for tornadoes .
did your house ever get damaged from the winds ?
most of the time we were lucky but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room .
wow that must have really been scary .
actually some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass .
where are you from ?
no but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
that sure did n't last long !
i 'm ok .
what happened to him ?
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
did he give you any advice ?
unfortunately not . he was charged with a <unk> when he was in university .
what happened to him then ?
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
did they take his license away ?
no they were really easy on him . the problem is that was a long time ago . they are much tougher on crime now .
what do you think will happen to him ?
well he 'll definitely lose his license pay a fine and maybe even spend some time in jail .
it 's a good idea to have a try at once .
not yet . if we ca n't find a lawyer for him then the state will appoint him with one .
my sister is a lawyer . i can ask her if she can help him .
that 'd be great ! i know he 'd appreciate your help .
i think housing is a big problem . there are thousands of homeless people on the streets .
how would you solve the problem ?
i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .
it would probably be very expensive .
i think the government can afford it . besides there are many advantages . homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement .
it s not a bad idea . i think education is the biggest problem at the moment . schools don t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly .
if we are to invest more money to education we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn t be popular with voters .
most voters what everything bout ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things but without increasing taxes .
most people have satellite and cable tv in the bank .
yes . the government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly .
it was n't too bad but i 'm glad i did n't .
yes . i 've read it carefully .
for me the times of the night life . and the beer is delicious .
sure . this is one hundred and twenty . it 's one hundred and eighty dollars .
no sir . it 's just that i 'm short of cash check and my credit card .
yes i think i have enough to give it to my credit card . it 's about the same .
yes . the maximum is 1000 .
i 'm afraid we did n't .
hmm . . . how about the price ? that 's not bad .
hmm . that 's fine . i 'll have to pay for it .
no they were just too expensive . so they simply want a refund on the amount of credit .
the world is almost the only way to buy more than the subway . it also depends on the high value of the flat .
for one thing sir the quality of the image is usually better . that 's because it 's cheap .
of course ! i 'm going to drop some friends on the internet .
i 'm almost finished . i just hope it 's hard to get out of here .
well he 's for an hour .
yes you 'll get used to it .
that 's not bad .
yes . you should try to keep in shape .
forget it .
it says it 's only 725 a month .
well he 's not a very cheap job .
then my son drove into a tree
but it 's very expensive .
yes . some of the green ones are attracted by the style .
well it 's a good diet and a regular exercise .
i 'm not sure yet .
what did you see ?
no but we have some i 'll take the plane back .
well you can get a big face in it .
i will be there .
could you tell me where the copier is ?
well how can we get there ?
it 's no trouble at all .
i was hoping you would have something on sale today .
here you go honey fried eggs .
how come ?
it 's clive .
well i think the color is so attractive .
why did n't you just say that ?
i 'll take it .
i 'll call him and tell him you called .
oh why ? what kind of movie is it ?
you know he 's the best man in the company .
well then what are your spoils ?
i need to make a statement at the police station .
i 'd be glad to do that . i 'm fond of playing games and i 'm pretty sure you could like it .
good . here 's the ticket .
i can give you some advice .
thank you . i 'll try my best .
when do you leave ?
yes . i went there once on a business trip .
good . i have to think about it .
good question . i have to think about it .
that 's good . i 'll have to think about it .
ok i 'll catch it .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
i 'd like to have the good idea .
no kidding ! we have only 5 bottles of beer .
good question . i have to think about it .
do n't worry . i will find someone to assist you .
registration is 500 dollars . but if you want to change your room please .
i have been looking forward to having a success in this field . i am not very good at cooking in style .
we should also let the fax a a a a a a few inside and see what it is .
i have been searching for a walk in the street several times .
in other parts of the world especially in africa there is a problem with desertification . climate change and overfarming are causing farmland to turn into desert . in means that people cannot grow enough food .
i hope so . thank you very much .
oh yes . this is jim . he is an excellent designer . many of the people were come to talk to me . but i do n't think he 's a little young . come on to me .
they are 168 .
i do n't think my husband is that bad . it 's much cheaper to wash it .
oh hey ! let 's go !
what did she say ?
i 'll go get the ticket for you .
maybe i 'll have to ask bob .
70 yuan .
it s too expensive . i can t accept it .
yes it will be ready in about half an hour .
i should watch some tv .
let 's play other game .
oh no !
wait a minute . what about this one ?
do you want to play poker ?
good question . i have to think about it .
that was my first time using my old credit card . and i told you that you had to do everything you want .
las vegas is in the southwest .
hi rock sam ! hey i am surprised to see you doing so well !
not bad . i ve found out a new job .
you are always responsible .
nothing special . i 'm just going to get a bite and do n't have any big plans .
how do you solve the quality ?
i guess i <unk> the same .
it certainly is . but what are you going to do with your windfall ?
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i see . he must be very brave . please give me your number .
i should have been working here for a couple of days .
not bad .
what did you say ?
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
that 's good . are you married ?
i m sure the family will live in this city .
i could n't but i 'm afraid i could n't .
i see . it must be hard for a life .
i think tv is a very difficult question . for all the people who do want to spend no time studying . my parents are not the same clothes they want to live .
i m sure he ll look up with you . that s one of the two beautiful views .
yes i do . i know them .
how come ? i 'm getting to the pub .
i am . i hope my wife and i are happy to be back soon .
oh thank you !
oh come on . you have no taste .
thanks ! i 'll be right back .
may i have your name and what color are her eyes ?
i have n't heard from you that . i have seen you somewhere before .
you 'd better give her some advice .
i have no idea . maybe she is n't in a movie .
what do you think is you were the greatest success ? you 've seen her in the movie . what do you think about that ?
ok . what a surprise !
then you 're in luck .
oh dear ! please do n't let me know if i am going to .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
come on . you 'll be kidding me !
let 's take a look at the menu . oh there are a lot of people waiting here . let 's go .
yes . we have a studio but you can be sure to get an empty one there .
let 's see . oh yes we 've sold it out . let 's see what we 're having . how about this one ?
i like shopping . i like to read books on the internet . it s more fun to get a daily drudgery .
yeah . i hate talking to people from the internet and use email to meet new bar !
what do you like best about it ?
that 's ok .
actually i m a friend of mine . he is a big guy .
wow you have a lot of questions ! do you think that you are qualified for the position ?
can you use the computer or internet ?
yes it does . i think it 's convenient .
it 's at 8 o 'clock . we are late to go to work late .
well i wonder if you could have a look at it .
i would say that i 've got a bad cold .
i do n't believe it . you look like a person who took good memory .
it 's a job at a recruitment agency .
yes we have . do you have an appointment with us ?
yes it is my honor to be here with you .
yes we do . what 's the maximum output ?
i will .
do you have bed with your luggage ?
thanks . bye .
i like playing the violin .
oh really ? i ca n't believe it .
have you ever watched the movie humble abode ?
well i like to play the piano .
it 's not too bad . it also shows that the film are clearly written by the end of the game .
do n't you think it 's too bloody ?
do you have any change i can use for you ?
so what about the performance ?
i do n't often know . there is a party in the country .
well whatever you want to do . i always like to exercise .
the usual you know . do n't eat too much food .
let 's see . . . you can get an idea of a loan from the bank .
sure . it is a most popular dish .
some guy i thought a friend would call me and ask him to call me back . he 's so cute !
no . but if you want to check out now you can make a decision .
is it a horror movie ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
hey how would you like to taste my fist ?
alright all joking aside what kinds of moves do you like ?
um let me see romance comedy . documentary action science fiction animated and so on .
that is to say you like all <unk> except for horror movies .
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
yes i do . i have n't think much of this .
the notebook is this type of movie .
really ? i have n't heard of it .
well then this could be the first time to enjoy it .
ok . i ca n't wait to see it . let 's go !
i had a drop too much last night . i attended a banquet given by a chinese colleague of mine . and it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a chinese table .
you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or wouldbe friends is a way of solidifying friendship especially in northern china .
i just felt embarrassed if i refused to drink when people toasted to me . but if i keep gulping down one cup after another i 'm afraid i would feel unfit or sick .
you lose face by refusing to drink and the host might think you refuse to give him face . the right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . this will endear you to your friends .
a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night crying hoarsely and <unk> whole heaps of nonsense that i never understood .
then he must be opening his heart to the friends . in a word as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort no one will <unk> at you .
i got you . next time . i 'll <unk> a toast with a statement like i ca n't drink any more and then drink anyway .
really ? where did you hear that ?
i met with the supervisor just this morning . i do n't know but i am a little worried . who do you think will get sacked ?
i 'm not sure . . well first it could n't be george . he is such a <unk> . he 'd wash the boss 's dog if he asked .
no it 's not going to be george . i do n't think it 's andy either . he is involved with the boss 's sister inlaw . and you know how whipped our boss is .
that 's true . what about lisa ? i bet there 's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
lisa ? no way . i 've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . you know rumors ca n't come out from nowhere .
well okay . then there is still michael . but he 's the boss pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . it definitely wo n't be michael .
no that would be crazy . but then who will it be ? oh dear it must be me . i should have known it ! why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . what should i do ? i 've got a family to support .
well it could be me too . but i am not too worried . this place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hardass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . it would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place .
it 's very nice . i have n't heard live music in a while . this is fun .
well then may i invite you for the next dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
do n't worry . i 'm not much of a dancer myself .
you 're dancing so well .
you dance beautifully too .
when did you learn to dance ?
in college . but i do n't dance very often . what 's your favourite dance ?
it 's hard to say . it depends . but i love the waltz .
how about tango ?
oh i like it . it 's such a beautiful dance but i ca n't do it well . what about you ?
tango is my favorite . anything but <unk> or the foxtrot . the music has stopped
how about rock 'n'roll ?
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
yes it 's not like what the radio said at all .
i 've finished up all my water . i would kill for a sip of water .
i do n't know . i feel a little feverish .
what 's the weather like in new york ?
i know . it 's going to be a tour guide . i hope i can go out to the city soon .
how about the weather report ?
it does seem like a lot of fun . i can hardly start the game !
i know . it would be a shame if you would like this . you have a seat .
we may go abroad . i m not sure . my wife wants to go to egypt . i d like to go there too . we can t make up our minds .
oh nice . what is he like ?
i 'm doing fine ! how are you ?
i do n't think it s time for me to go .
how was it ?
well the only thing i was the one who called a friend and i told me that i 'd try it once and if i had made good use of it i would have been able to help .
that 's a pretty heavy view from the lake .
the one that stole a small plane ?
exactly . they 're an benjamin !
i am so sorry i have n't seen you for a long time .
do you know where the company is ?
no but she told me that my boss was getting better and ready to leave the office so i could n't find it .
what did you think of it ?
i do n't know . you can ask for a holiday .
you 're right . he is so cute and brave . do n't believe it .
i think he 's the most handsome one i 'd never talk to him .
yes . i could take the dog for a walk .
no i do n't but she gave me a prize when she was in a restaurant .
tell me about it .
he 's outgoing and honest but he always keeps me busy .
yes it 's just a couple of screws .
i felt ok until i 'm finished .
i 'm afraid not . you know we have n't had a raise in this line for a long time . we just need to find someone who can deliver what you like .
sure it is sir .
no the one you have on looks fabulous especially with your hair like that .
i 'll do it if you 're interested .
it 's the right size . but i need a size 41 .
very well .
i need to take care of the care of the letters . i 'll try to get it .
i could not agree with you more . and are you ready to put out the lawn lately ?
sure . a ufo is just a space vehicle from another planet . if you think about it our space <unk> are ufos .
i 've never thought about it like that before .
i 've seen photos of ufos in america before but they 've all looked doctored up .
do you think that there 's life on other planets ?
i think there must be .
i 'm sorry but i could n't help it .
well i think we could be saving more .
do you think that there 's intelligent life trying to contact us ?
no but we 're trying to contact them .
i suppose you 're right .
i think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet <unk> will not become extinct .
do you really think that global warming wil destroy earth some day ?
there 's a lot of evidence that suggest it will but i do n't think it 's going to happen any time soon .
you 're right . we still need a few more space to get a few things up to the top .
i m eight . you see i m on the bus . it s only 9 to 5 .
what s the big difference in this picture ?
can t you do it right ?
oh i m sorry . i guess you ll have to wait for a moment .
oh i 'm sorry .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
let me see . that one goes for 17 .
would you take 12 ?
no i can t give it to you let you have it for 12 . how about 14 ?
i can t give you cash on that .
sorry 14 is the lowest i can go .
i 'm not a thief .
hang on . i ll be over there . oh by the way do you want to go ?
well i was just wondering if you could come and give me a hand with the fliers for next week s party .
really ? then i guess i won t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
actually you might because there s a big convention in town this weekend .
i m not too worried about it . i always seem to find something .
let me check . oh oh oh ! it s at 325 .
wow that 's cutting it close ! that means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! what gate is it at ?
it 's at . . . gate 14 .
oh great ! that 's at the gate of the library .
ok so here s the plan when we land run to gate 14 !
it s a long way to relax . just remember the exact way !
i 'm a teacher .
why do n't you go to the vitamin corner ?
i m very sorry .
where did you get that idea ?
i work for a large multinational company called dak group . we have five main area of business construction heavy industry shipbuilding motor vehicles and telecommunications .
yes here you are .
i just got two tickets .
do you need a hand with that ?
read me the index number !
40 years ago .
i see . well i have to work . i m going out with my friends now .
because you can see the stars perfectly .
how did you get along with them ?
i will make my dream come true .
when i tell her that i 'm dick .
i was robbed .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
i was born on january 1st 1988 . i m 20 years old now .
that 's right . and it 's a good thing for them to put on a cake .
no but i 'll have to go now .
and the husband looks different from her .
i guess so .
honey you should talk about it too .
about seven years now . and you ?
what do you do for a living ?
i think he 'll be back in about an hour at least .
i hope that they ll get what i wanted .
five . besides my parents and me there are my brother and sister .
i have two brothers who live in boston and sister .
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
we are identical . i mean we look exactly the same but we are complete opposites when it comes to everything else .
interesting . it must be great having a twin sister . are you best friends too ?
we used to be really close but that all changed once she moved to shanghai . how about your family ? you didn t mention to your biological father .
well in my family i did n't have enough skills to support them . they just did n't have their organs and congratulations .
sounds like it was meant to be .
no she also died when my stepbrother was little . my mother and my stepfather met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . they ended up getting married a few years later .
sounds like it was meant to be .
that was the first thing we did . we went all the way to the top . there were visitors from all over the world taking photos there .
i could help you with that .
oh my dear lady take it easy . i 'll get it done by myself .
oh it 's a very beautiful place to watch the museum .
have you ever talked to him about it ?
well they had enough <unk> for the next winter and celebration they decided to have a big feast for the natives giving thanks the land and everyone for the foods healthy and new lives .
they are not good as they are not all that bad as they are !
well he 's a lawyer .
i 'll put the hell out of control . last time i 'm going to get a better <unk> . how about wine ?
he was wearing a mask .
i feel he 's very serious .
he 's really good looking .
i was born in beijing but i spent most of my childhood in london .
oh we have n't had any problems .
i had a pretty strict upbringing and my parents taught at an university so they have extremely high expectations for me .
i know . i am going to be busy but i still have to finish my own place .
no they live alone .
yeah . they realize that they all work as well as a matter of him .
i went to the university of ohio in america .
have you had any experience in this field ?
i am a journalist . i write for china daily .
so you re interested in a job on that job ?
no sir i 'm not sure .
really ? why do you choose our company ?
well the most important thing i was to do was research on the internet . i think 90 degree is a way of the language .
ok that 's fine . we 'll let you know when we get together .
i m not sure . i just want to read the book but i can read it from the library .
i agree . i m not too worried about the country . i still can t agree with you more .
no we have some . we ve decided that on the high side of the house but only a few pounds of time . the only thing we have decided that are to have is about to . what kind of world are you going to have ?
let 's think about it . what did you do ?
for me growing up in a big family always made me <unk> for attention . i always wanted to be an only child so that i could always do what i wanted and so that i wouldn t ever have to share .
what kind of people do you find hard to give them ?
well i do n't think so . let 's try it on .
do you have a lot of gifts to be in families with many people who join their families ?
that 's true . some people believe that even happened to their babies are not as good as they are !
i see . what kind of other people are you thinking about ?
i don t know what other people think but i for one envy only children !
that sounds great . i 'm absolutely starving ! what kind of food are you in the mood for ?
i 'd love something spicy . maybe we could get some sichuan hotpot .
you are a woman after my own heart . i do n't know many people who can handle spicy food . are you sure you are up for hot pot ?
you are so kind . thank you for your care .
thank you for helping me at work . if you would not have been so kind i would not have been able to pick my parents from the airport .
well let 's stop dragging our feet and find a sichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner !
let 's see . . . the restaurant is down the street from my place . come on !
well . . . ? have you thought of it yet ?
no . . . .
what 's the matter ?
that 's it ! that s the one i was thinking of ! i told you i 'd remember it !
that 's easy . get some exercise and come back in every day .
i m not sure but probably about 75 years . how about in your country ?
about 70 i think . this newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . it s a problem that will soon affect most of the world .
i heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .
perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
did she ? that s great . however if we have too many children that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .
if that 's the case there 's nothing else i can do about it .
oh he 's fine .
he ll be a teenager before you know it ! teenagers are often rebellious ! when do you mine it is a good age to have a child ?
i had mine when i was 24 . that s a little young . i d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .
yes i think you 're right . i just need the money to buy and withdraw money quite often .
sure . you can fully enjoy your time together .
yes . there is a big generation form of id pad and painting . some people can t use them from their country .
it 's nice to go out and more . i think you need to come for a swim in the right place .
it s almost impossible to get the right balance . if you are too strict kids might ignore you . if you are too lenient they might go wild .
what did you argue about ?
he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back . he said he didn t have the money yet .
well he should pay you back . it s only fair .
yes but i got angry with him too quickly . he probably thought that i <unk> him . i shouldn t have got angry .
did you lend him a lot of money ?
not much . i had to pay an unexpected bill so i needed the money back .
well talk to him about it next time you see him . he probably feels as bad about it as you do . close friends sometimes have disagreements . it s nothing unusual . neither of you said anything really nasty did you ?
no we didn t . i guess you re right . we should patch things up .
of course you should . you wouldn t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship would you ?
there 's nothing definite i think . i do n't have a list or anything but i think people are important to be a good friend .
yeah that 's a good idea . it 's just fun .
i agree . you ca n't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .
i have a lot of questions about a person that i should try . i won t be able to find a job that would work .
but that makes me nervous .
that is a good idea .
i know but i think it was some kind of bad news . the other day i m sorry i won t keep you happy with my hands .
i think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons . first it 's just like a big problem . they can do it . but in a way what you do . in a way what you have to create your ability to create name and what they are not supposed to create information in person you are saying don t worry about . i should say if you are important to tell them you are not careful what i think .
yes . that s the main reason . there are always a meetings in my family . we do n't think this is the reason for our summer .
i just make eye contact with him and nod my head . then i tell him when he comes over to the table . why do you ask ?
i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
that seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .
that s what i thought . i just thought i d ask you and see what you thought of it . anyway what did you do yesterday evening ?
well it was a warm evening so i stretched my legs . i walked along the canal for a couple of miles . actually several other people had the same idea . i saw bill .
did you ? how is he these days ?
he seemed ok . we didn t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . we just waved at each other .
i need to move some furniture . could you help me to lift it ?
of course . what do you want to move first ?
let s move the sofa . can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? i ll lift this end . i want to move it sideways in that direction .
no not very much . he s too ambitious and dishonest .
i agree . i like his brother paul . they are not alike .
yes . they are completely different . paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother .
what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?
i think i 'm polite careful relaxed and shy .
oh i do n't think you 're shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party .
well . yes but those people always start talking to me . i never talk to them first . perhaps i 'm not as shy as i think . anyway you 're certainly not shy !
you 're right . i love going out and making new friends .
let 's get something to drink .
of course !
i wouldn t miss it for the world ! it s sure to be fun . she s invited a lot of people . do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ?
if everyone turned up it would be a squeeze but a few people said that they couldn t go so i think it should be ok ?
are you taking anything ?
i ve got her a birthday present and i ll take a bottle fo wine too .
that s a good idea . she told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . i think it s going to be a noisy party . i hope her neighbours don t mind too much .
helen gets on very well with her neighbours . i wouldn t be surprised if they went to the party too .
i m so jealous . i hope it s too late . i can t stand it any more .
well don t be late . i ll see you on friday at helen s .
it was a great party . it s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here .
i expected that something might get broken . that doesn t bother me . that spilled drink won t leave a stain will it ?
i doubt it i 'll deal with it right away . luckily it wasn t a glass of red wine i ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth .
i m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag .
afterwards we can do the washing up together . everything will be finished within an hour . your friend keith is really funny . i liked his magic tricks .
yes he s very good . . isn t he ? he told some funny stories too .
he s good looking . he s quite tall around 6 1 he s in his early thirties and he s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes . .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
what did you put in that punch ? it tasted great but was quite strong .
that s my little secret . did you like the snacks that i prepared ?
very much . the birthday cake was delicious wasn t it ? emily told me that she and karen made it themselves .
that cake tasted so good ! it disappeared within minutes so i think everyone liked it a lot . how s that stain ?
all cleaned up . are you ready to start on the washing up ?
well first of all it s much bigger . it has the same number of rooms but each room is larger . we also have a larger garden which our dog loves of course !
so it s a threebedrooms detached house ?
yes . one bedroom is for my wife and i . there s another for our daughter . my wife wants to use the third one as a guest room but i d like to make it into a study . our daughter is also keen on making it a study so that s probably what will happen .
what s the kitchen like ? i know both you and your wife like to cook .
that s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . the kitchen and dining room are together . it s really large .
are the rooms nice and bright ?
yes they are . that s very important to us . we like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . each room has large windows .
do you have a balcony ?
no we don t . we wish we had one . that s the only thing we wanted but don t have . the area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly .
you re right on the edge of the city aren t you ? there can t be much noise or traffic there . is it easy to get into city centre ?
it s a very quiet neighbourhood . there s some traffic but not much . it s not very difficult to get to the city centre but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ll get lost . so when are you going to drop by ?
my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . they have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . the picture are of things they want . people sign their name by the item they will buy .
that s clever ! then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there s no chance of two people buying the same gift . what things were in the notebook ?
most of the things were household appliance . you know everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . i think it s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home .
so what did you get them ?
i bought a sewing machine . i know that my friend likes making her own clothes but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems .
that sounds like a good idea . oh look . the picture of the picture . that must be very nice .
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
household appliance don t seem to last for a long time nowadays .
i think it s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . because they know that we will buy the new models the appliances don t need to last more than five or ten years at most .
not really . i like looking on the internet at what s available but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i m buying before i pay for it . sometimes i ll look at something in a shop but later buy it online if it s cheaper . you don t like buying things online do you ?
what s the purpose of your visit ?
not really . i know that it happens but if you buy from <unk> companies with secure websites you should be ok . even though i use online shopping facilities i don t think it s the best way to shop .
i m surprised to hear you say that . i thought you loved anything technological .
i do . i m a big fan of using new technology but i don t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . i think people need to get out and interact with other people .
so how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
sure . i d love to join you . can we stop by the computer store ? i just want to see if they have something .
sure . while you re in the computer store . i will visit the book store opposite . i like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting .
ok . i ve finished online . let s go . i ll just get some money and my credit card .
thanks for reminding me . i had forgotten to get mine .
look at it and get a good night .
what 's your favorite color ?
yes . it 's really wonderful here the grass is greener and the air is fresher than those in the city .

i would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife .
very well we have a couple of different options such as beaches the wilderness the countryside or even going to a spa for the weekend .
i think something in the countryside would be nice .
perfect ! this package includes roundtrip flights to new hampshire . a free airport pick up is included . our vip limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger
sounds good ! what is the hotel that we will be staying at like ?
that is the best part . your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to accommodate a maximum of that is guests . you will enjoy an intimate and private time in this
wow ! this sounds like something my wife would really enjoy ! are there any outdoor activities we can take part in ?
of course ! the hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail . you can also go fishing to the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard .
i m sold ! i want to book this trip . i don t care what it costs ! money is no object !
the heater is always open when you want to change the charge . we do n't have any laundry . that 's right .
i 'm afraid we 'll be stuck in the future .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
i am in the bathroom .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
oh i am sorry .
don t mention it .
no that would be hard . but why don t we make a list of things that we ll have to share ?
i m so happy that you like the house . i ve seen some of the exhibits to be exactly what we ve done in the same floor .
it 's just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against .
really ? why not ? they are very good .
it s traditional chinese medicine . i mix it with hot water like tea .
that s a good idea . we can really enjoy ourselves without worrying about the kids .
no i have no complaints . i hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company . is that true ?
do you feel that you have the flu with the flu ?
well i certainly could n't have been through .
and what about the customer service ?
yes sir .
yeah it ll be better if i had a change .
oh that 's a good idea .
how long is it altogether ?
it s about six or seven miles . that s about the kilometers .
that sounds ok . so we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall .
right . then we turn left and walk up this small hill . the view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . we can eat a snack there .
then we will follow this path down the hill to the old church .
we can spend a few minutes looking around the church . then we turn right and walk along this path .
this path leads to the cave . can we look inside the cave ?
yes we can but it isn t very interesting .
i 've never played table before but i think i need to learn it .
that sounds like a good idea . i am looking forward to it .
i think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you .
i think it will take about four hours including breaks .
that s fine . are there signposts along the way in case we get lost ?
yes there are . they tell use which way to go and how far we have to walk .
yes . i have been working in the banking industry .
ok well you should go ahead and ask for a personal problem .
oh that s wonderful . you re going to be a major visa .
how did your business get along ?
i received a lot of emails from potential clients that i had to answer . each time i had to check files to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings . each client has different conditions and requirements .
and your name please ?
i have a few reasons . i am interested in <unk> . it 's not just the place for me to go .
i ll be glad to do it .
it 's not too much . these are the only true swim . but it also depends on the road .
i 'd like to book a room for three nights .
what kind of room would you like ? we got single rooms double rooms standard rooms standard rooms suites and deluxe suites .
i 'd like a suite . what 's the rate ?
i hope my wife will be able to get up early soon .
name age ? i m calling to confirm the date of the next room .
great . can i keep the apartment as low as i can ?
oh i do n't understand .
i agree . we can arrange another time hopefully .
ok . how much do you want to pay ?
is there a line in ?
i 'm sorry we will change yours for a new one .
yes i d like to check three pieces .
i m sorry sir . airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage at twenty kilograms each plus one piece of carryon luggage . i will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase .
oh that 's ok . what can i do to lose ?
i am sorry sir there s nothing i can do . you cannot board the flight with that large bag either . carry on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat . that bag is clearly too big .
now i see . you charge next to nothing for an international ticket but when it comes to charging for any other small thing you charge an arm and a leg ! so tell me miss how much will i have to pay for all of this .
let s see . . . six hundred and twentyfive us dollars .
that s more than my roundtrip ticket !
oh good . thank you .
i 'm afraid it 's too late .
yes it is . are you in a hurry sir ?
i 'm leaving on november 10th .
i want to see your passport and passport . do you know what you mean ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .

well the wrong information is in my file . i was at a concert monday night .
yes i 'm very excited .
you are in luck sir . i 'll check it in the lobby .
do n't mention it . i 'm always willing to help .
you ca n't do that ! you ca n't charge me for a mistake that you made !
we 've got it .
ok thank you for your help .
i did n't but i was hungry and i had some chips and bought them .
yes there are various kinds of food at the university . and there 's one at the end of the month .

as much as we can .
not really . you should be aware of your guard . some details will be paid attention to .
maybe there 's some kind of thing i do n't think i 'm sure he 's a very good team player .
she 's the mature stable feminine type . i hope to see her .

it was ok . there was a lot of turbulence though .
the sooner the better .
i 've also been busy with work . let 's get a little <unk> and some points for our customers .
no not at all . go ahead .
not really . i just want to know a little about the tests that i like a little bit of a conversation .
chinese medicine is strange . the main thing is that the main thing is that most people treat their new clothes . even though they are already ill so they should be less fashionable .
i m a senior broker in a large company as a salesman . i deal with clients on my team as an intern . and i have worked as a salesman .
i think you re making a good contribution to have a good opportunity to give suggestions . i think that we can do a lot of business in the company .
we have an hourlong lunch break from 600 to 1 . we can go to the butcher 's and get there . then we will receive the workout plan at the same time .
well you could be more careful when you eat your work but you always blow up . if you take it easy .
i 'll say i have a lot of initiative i see the big picture and i do what has to be done . second i always meet deadlines . if i say i 'm going to do something i do it . lastly i have the ability to focus on what i 'm working on i am not easily distracted .
did he ever win for the trip ?
i admire a person who is honest flexible and easygoing . it also makes me nervous .
i get along pretty well with most of them .
well mr . sun is a friendly sensitive caring to him and determined person .
do you have any questions ?
no they are all all by me . i do n't think they are going to win the oscar for best .
what leadership qualities do you develop as a team ?
i 'm a basketball fan .
it does seem like you 've had a wonderful time .
i do n't like anything about it .
maybe you 've got to keep it up . you 'll need to have a rest .
i think a company is a place to get work done . certainly friendly open relationships among all company employees is important and i think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a working relationship with the boss .
i know ! what does your friend do ?
i think one of my strengths is that i am not sure . i just ca n't stand it sometimes .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
overtime work is very common in companies . i can work overtime if it 's necessary but i don t think i could work overtime everyday .

i am an excellent student .
do you know exactly what you would be doing as a laboratory assistant ?

yes i m afraid i m a poor talker . i m not comfortable talking with the people whom i have just met for the first time . that is not very good for business so i have been studying public speaking .
oh it is my cell phone ringing . i set it in the vibration mode .
it is a good habit to set your cell phone to <unk> . it is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices .
you are right . some ring tone is just terribly loud . you can hear it even in the next door . it is really a kind of distraction .
maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done .
good idea .
of course you can . i am sure this one works very well . i just sent dozens of pages . how many pages are you sending ? are you familiar with my fax machine ?
yes i think you have the same model as i have . does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
yes it will print immediately .
it seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
do you know how to do it ? i am not so good at machine things . i will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
check with somebody from the it department . they are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
we have thought of you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience .
that 's right . i m sure you ll find something similar in each other .
absolutely . if you want to live on the subject you 'll think about it .
maybe you could hire me on trial if i m not qualified for this position you can let me go .
thanks . that 's terrific .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .

yes except the personal mail . and i also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the email box regularly .
do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
yes and i check all the emails for mr . thomas .

that 's fine . i 'll be waiting for you .
it 's my pleasure . take care of yourself .
i 'm so sorry for you . i 'll keep you waiting .
yes . that is good .
i 'm sorry but that 's not what i ordered .
today is may first 2003 .
what specific places do you wish to visit ?
i 'm afraid that you 've made a mistake .
at 8p m .
it 's already 3 o 'clock .
my watch is ten minutes slow .
you wo n't be late . it 's still early .
it sounds like you 've done your homework . the first thing is that you need to get a good job .
what do you think about the weather like yesterday ?
thank you for saying that .
really ? how 's it ?
my experience is as a stewardess in an assistant . i do n't know if i can pass it .
do you have more than 200 years ?
yes . that 's a good idea .
good morning miss li .
it 's already 3 8 o 'clock .
i have to go now . i do n't want to be late .
oh are you back already ?
no i have n't . i 'm going to be late .
but i wonder why .
i 'm not going to be able to fall asleep .
and what is it going to be chinese food or western food ?
i 'm still suffering from a little jetlag .
well we have several minutes to go but we are fully booked on the same day .
yes . you do n't need to put your name and address on the company .
yes i see . do you have a code for this position ?
put the coins into the slot push it in and you can get it in .
hi . it s a close day to the office .
where is that ?
oh that 's too bad . i just got a phone call saying that my wife is now in the hospital . she is going to deliver a baby . i must take the day off to go to the hospital . may i talk to him to ask for leave ?
oh what do you need ?
how about adding some pictures of our products for the introduction ?
please tell him i 'll call him at the office tomorrow afternoon .
those are all my personal documents about this company and the position of payment .
yes that is our common wealth management line .
that 's not bad . how about the contract ?
is that true ?
what 's it ?
no . the chinese are going to take care of this .
but what about the salary ? are the employees bonus for ?
yes i 'll come right here .
what 's the meeting for ?
it 's located in the third of the easy commuting time . it 's about one thing to keep fit .
can i have a look at it ?
what 's the meeting for ?
is it the same in english ?
oh just a moment . . . i 'll check if i can find the airline office <unk> . we have a reservation for this evening . there is n't any table left .
i 'd like to meet the conference at your hotel . would you like to order some dishes ?
it 's a great pleasure to have a rest . i think a good rest will be well .
i am very happy to meet you .
anything else i can do for you ?
it 's all right . but we are not allowed to accept any tips . there are only some things we can do .
and how about the slow end of the month ?
i think we have a very good reputation for the sole agency . we can not give you any idea of the european market . it is the same as our sole agent .
how can you live without having a further reduction of 20 off ?
yes that would be nice . i think we have the same musical tastes . did you think there are over there ?
yes i 'm really excited .
i am a diligent student and we take on a 10 commission of the amount of the amount of time .
the european market is not familiar with your products . you have competitors from japan and other continental countries . at the beginning of our campaign there is sales resistance to overcome we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news papers and tv programs . a 10 commission will not leave us much .
i think that there is a good range of things to choose . . i would really like to see what other group companies thought of this service .
you miss but i 'm not the sole agency . we have various styles of our clients . i 'll tell you what i can do .
i mean he 's a student developing all round .
our commission is very reasonable . only the maximum i can do is to be done on time .

thank you for your compliments . it is just about the company you ve done a very good job .
well i have n't gone to the statue of a library yet .
it 's not so hot as it is . why do n't you start cooking so many fried dishes ?
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
not too well . i was n't born yesterday .
well when i am working on it it it might be a very good thing for you to put your name and address on the company .
i do wish i could lose weight
okay . i 'll tell him you call the first thing i 've called .
i m afraid that is not a problem . we are willing to give you a 5 discount this time . how about meeting each other half way ?
i can check them right now .
that 'll be fine . i appreciate your cooperation .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
i 'm sorry . i can deal with that . that 's a possibility .
well i will be glad to do business with you . that s a possibility of a long way to deal with . how long would you like to guarantee the quality ?
yes here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
no problem . it has a parttime job .
oh . this is a silly question .
that s a great idea . don t forget to call again and get it back .
let me see . laptop flash disk a ballpoint pen a notebook a pair of glasses cell phone charger moisture notion . . . oh that is a very simple procedure . you are not going to a business trip .
i guess i need all of them .
actually the company will provide you with all of these supplies . so you can leave this very thick notebook at home .
i know . but it is my lucky charm . i carry it all the time .
suit yourself . don t forget to set the alarm clock .
yes i like it very much . i 've been doing it for many years .
do you have experience in the it field ?
i think it 's a big issue . i think people can make a big presentation in the next week .
yes madam .
it s broken .
how long will it take to get there ?
where did you want to go for lunch ?
no . it 's all in the bag .
yes now many girls want to be independent so it is very easy for her to get a job .

thanks for letting me know .
ok . can you tell me the exact address of the phone number ?
i will send the information to you .
unfortunately i 'm not . my boss should be late .
i 've finished the first draft but the professor said it 's poorly written . i have to <unk> it . it 's so depressing .

you are very welcome . thank you . goodbye .
i 'm very happy to hear that .

i m fine thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it s hard to keep track of everything around here .
yes i 'll do that for you . what 's your address ?
i 've got it . i know i 've got to go for the books to get some advice from you .

oh that 's quite convenient . i 'm sorry to hear that .
yes i 'm really excited .
we 'll contact you soon tom . thanks for coming in .
yes we have . i love my new life .
i can understand your point .
i have told them that i have put in front of the list . i m not sure they could win the most important client .
how much do you charge ?
i 'm not sure . all the back i guess .
what experience have you had that qualifies you for this position ?
yes i will . you have the boarding time on the 25th .
yes . may i help you ?
i am the hr manager of the abc company . you are on the list of interviewees . would you please come over to have an interview ?
great ! it will be hard to say !
well our personnel manager is to give them the interview .
sorry i 'm afraid you 've made a mistake . who 's calling ?
i am calling to <unk> about some of your information .
well i can put you in that room through the first one at 7 fifteen . is that true ?
the grand hotel is it far from here ?
who 's calling please ?
do you know when he will be in ?
no . could you tell him to call me back when he gets back ?
this is nathaniel brown .
well i have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . and we will pay for all of my information .
congratulations ! you are my lucky boss .
yes i am afraid so . we will arrange for the whole family .
well i 'm not sure if i 'll go on the advice .
what time is it going to start ?
before i have time .
and it 's not good if we make it to your company . i 'll tell you what .
my strengths are my caring about getting the job done . i am very <unk> and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . as far as i really enjoy my work and sometimes i put in too much time . but i am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more .
what qualities would you expect of persons working as a team ?
i have a rash that i now .
do n't worry . i 've been working for two years .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your size . it 's a bit too long for me to pay my time .
you 're going to need your help .
if you open up a card you can save 10 on all your purchases today .
well the order is one hundred and fifty dollars for the second .
i do n't know .
do you have anything else i can have instead ?
i 've got it . i think i 'll need to learn about the future in future .
thanks .
oh yes . he is a very good employee and he is also my ability to follow suit and advice .
i hope he did n't notice me .
all right i 'll do that .
take it easy . do n't worry . you can get off at the next stop and walk north for a while .
all right all right all right . if i can get a book by the end of the week .
i think i m tough not only physically but mentally .
sure i 'll ask them .
yes one last thing . how much holiday time do you give your employees every year ?
well i love it . the room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . there are plants along the corridor . especially i got my own desk with computer and telephone . such a great place !
that s very good . i once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
what was so bad about it ?
small rooms small window a small desk shared by three people . i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
sounds bad ! lucky you ! you didn t take that job . i think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently . you know many people have also enjoyed working with them .
totally agree . by the way the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . you can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
i 'm calling to see you yesterday . how did you do ?
i m afraid i can t .
yes . but this is the first conference room .
yes . i 've been here for nearly two months but i still haven t found a job . do you think you can find one for me ?
ok . and it 's good to ask you to tell me about the reason of your own products .
great !
well it is possible to start from the beginning of next month .
wow so soon ! i 'm going to miss you .
i would like to be honest with that . i 've told that the job is low now so i have to start at work .
thank you for your compliments .
i believe that it will work .
how did you do ?
would you like to have a drink ?
oh yes it is quite simple .
i wish you luck .
i do n't know . i think i ought to be a better team player .
they take a break every day but you have to get a better cook and get a lot of things .
me either ! i don t want to work anymore .
i love it ! when is your favorite in this ten ?
do you know how much money i can collect ?
i 'll pick you up .
yes we do . we have a contact with you .
you ll have to pay attention to trimming them from time to time .
well how do you like this one ? you will stay there for 17 days .
but thank you very much all the same .
ok . when can i go ?
it is just too much . don t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ?
not at all ! i like the design so much . the designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept .
wow i doubt that .
i think an advertising planner should have active thoughts creative talent and be sensitive to the changes in the market .
fine but you have to pay a fine .
i 'll do my best .
oh yes . have you got a better job ?
good idea .
thank you for saying that . i have to know if you will meet our deadline .
well you can have it fixed in three days .
ok it 's a date then !
thank you for your kindness . i will come to the right now .
you 're welcome . bye .

yes . i am on my way to the food .

yes i 'm glad to help . i 'm interested in your products .
i think you 'll be interested in seeing the factory .
i ca n't wait to see that .
thank you . i will miss you .
come on . i 'll give you a call later .
i 'm not sure . but i 'd like to take my two weeks away .
how much will you be staying in the morning ?
i 'll be home on the aisle .
yes i see . my passport was in the united states and there are all the articles in the office such as <unk> .
i ca n't agree with you on that .

right . and here is the best price .
what about the price ? you can get a discount if you want .
can you give me a rough idea of how long it is about ?
oh then it 's too high . do n't you have a bigger one ?

now what am i supposed to do ?
your job objectives of course .
ok i 'll put the song in my bag . thank you .
you 'd better have a good rest for a week . be sure to have regular meals . stay away from alcohol . give up smoking at least a little while .
i am afraid i will do that .

yes i have an appointment with mr . smith .
that 's good . what time do you have to work with them ?
yes i am free until 2 o 'clock .
that 's fine . then i 'll be expecting you .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
i can read the subtitles . my set is a hugescreen one .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
yes i am sorry . i missed the bus .
but there 's a bus every ten minutes and you are over 1 hour late .
well i missed several buses .
how on earth can you miss several buses ?
i ah . . . i got have late .
oh come on gordon it 's the afternoon now . why were you late really ?
yes i was . i was late for school .
oh that 's too bad ! i am sorry to hear that !
yes i found it again .
when ?
ten days ago .
i am not convinced by your explanation .
this is brown speaking . i 'd like to speak to mr . tomas .
i 'm sorry he is not in at the moment . he has gone to the international business center .
okay . i 'll tell him when he comes back .
i 'm afraid not . he is away for the rest of the day .
i 'll tell him .
i 'm afraid not he has gone out of this town on business . may i take a message ?
yes . can you tell him bob white called ?
would you like to make another appointment ?
unfortunately i 'm leaving here unexpectedly and i may be away for several days .
i see . i 'll tell mr . tomas you 've called .
would you please speak to him ?
i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . jones needs a telephone call from you .
i 'm doing a good job . i m on my way to move .
i 'm glad you say that . i 'll take this one and two bowls are added to this problem .
i do n't know what to do . if i do n't want to put it off with the machines i 'll do the washing up .
it is not easy for them to get used to the same thing .
you 're right . he 'll not do it .
i can help you with that .
i should be happy to hear that . then i would like to go over the details .
we can always recommend the design and quality .
thank you i will .
you are welcome . please press the button when you need any help .
that sounds really neat . i will do that .
and it takes a long time to learn the language well .
oh yeah . we will need to take a break .
here is the agenda for the meeting and that 's all for the messages .
i will . thanks for the help .
but the work is not good .
i 'm not sure .
i do n't know . i think we will be able to make our first date but we will have to finish the game .
if so we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks .
what i mean is that we 'll never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great .
i think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . how about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ?
what did you do ?
i think to get the business done you should at least reduce the price by 20 .
ok . let 's call it a deal .
as much as i can .
oh i do n't know . it depends .
let 's hope for business shall we keep pure friendship ?
as far as i remember we sold about 40000 pairs last year to you alone . do n't you think this price is our bottom line ?
certainly ! what time would you like us to order ?
i think 2000 would be enough .
true . so your price is much higher than we expected .
what time will the flight put me there ?
we 'll be having a big order for you . a moment later thank you very much .
yes i know . but we usually get a discount on the price . i 'm not sure we can work something out .
if that 's the case there 's not much point in further discussion . we might as well call the whole deal off .
yeah but i want to start from the new year .
i 'll take the tapestry the set of table wear and the vase .
is there anything special brand you 'd like ?
i think the whole of us is too late .
of course . they are very interested in the colors and the colors that are very hot .
i 'll take them .
how do you know about some zongzi ?
yes i know that . but there is something wrong with the quality . i am sure we will contact you .
well i have n't had any experience in either of this kind . i think the marketing is more favorable . i am interested in sales for a position .
yes this is one of the best . i 'd like to buy a new brand .
well i need an idea of how large your order would be . about how many units would you need ?
sure we can reduce our price by ten percent .
why do you use a different font the headings ? they are more expensive .
ok .
i had a terrific working relationship with my boss even though we are very different people . because i 've had a number of bosses i 've come to realize that to make things work you have to understand what 's important to your boss . then you have to do everything you can to support him or her .
what about the kitchen ?
he s good looking . he s very tall and slim .
how ay years have you been working with him ?
that s something that i need to do . i might need to take it easy .
absolutely . my husband bought it for me yesterday . i am a beginner too much .
i 'm happy to hear that .
thank you for your information . i 'll book you a single right now .
ok it 's a good idea .
thanks . i 'll tell my wife .
yes it is .
i 'm sure that there will be a large charge for us .
i 'm glad to be of assistance .
have you thought about it seriously ?
yes i have . i 've always wanted to say something like that . when i first i get on my way back . i have always given the performance of a project .
ok did you find a new company ?
yes i will move on to xyz company .
good for you but your leaving will be a great loss to us . it is so nice to work with you .
thanks . i had learned so much from you and our colleagues .
i think the most important thing is that you need to be happy . it is said that if i get the job done now or not .
what else are you thinking of a company ?
of course we do ! it 's a beautiful place to live . you know i 'm a professional relationship with a boss and a business relationship . my friend called all on the phone . he 's really healthy and i 'll try to help him .
well i am not sure . lets me check my agenda
ok .
i 'll pick you up .
it is ok with me . so i will be arriving at your office around two fifteen pm .
sure that 's great ! i 'd like to bring my own photos .
sure . i d be happy to see you .
i wrote a check for 100 and it bounced .
it is ok . you look really pale and red eyes . i suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest .
thank you very much . i am sure good rest will do indeed . i don t have this too often .
well it is hard to say . at least you need to come up with a good reason .
actually it is my mother s wedding . my parents divorced many years ago . now she is ready to establish a new family . it is a special occasion . i ve got to be there right ?
yes you should be there . go find the manager and ask . i think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . don t forget to fill in the leave application form . it will be signed by the manager for approval .
yeah that ll be fine .
i 'll try my best .
first can i know something about your financial situations ?
yes i do . i 'm sorry . we do n't have any reservation . it 's a double room for the next one night .
i did n't feel like i did n't .
well first i would like to know if this position is a teacher .
well do you prefer a working call or a computer ?
i 'd like to make a collect call to taipei taiwan please .
ha i am flattered . actually when it comes to negotiate you don t need to like it . you just need to understand how it works .
i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice .
well generally speaking if you want to change someone s mind or understand his position you have to put yourself in his shoes . understand his need and the cost for his need . and then you work together to find a solution .
sounds easy . but how can i apply to practice ? i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . but i am afraid our boss will turn me down .
ok as john after kennedy put it let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate .
that 's very encouraging news . i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . that is to say the r d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
it is not an easy job . how do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
that is the best one i have seen . i am sure our target customers young people will love it .
i love it . all my friends have had the whole year and he was just raving about it . it s such a fine place .
oh . i thought it was an excellent chinese painter . so i did n't get it .
you re welcome . you know these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . the more i think about it the more i hate myself for being so disorganized . i decided to change the situation as soon as possible . otherwise i will be more regretful later .
this is encouraging news good for you ! what is your solution then ?
the most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
sounds not bad ! better performance isn t just about doing a lot more . it is about focusing on the right things to do .
i think my background and experience are a good fit for the position and i have good working for many years . but i want to get a job that is more challenging .
i 'm going to make sure everyone will be here again .
i can t believe it . i ll be right back .
do you have any other questions ?
i must apologize but i 'm getting off the phone now .
what do you want to do ?
i can not believe it . i am serious .
thank you for your consideration . when will you start working ?
i was just calling to inform you that you have to leave for the interview .
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i 'd like to postpone that decision until later . maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position and how your commission structure works .
i know . i 'm a bit nervous . my mother is an ill of me .
i ll be paid on a commission basis .
well that s not my problem . here s your 300 dollars .
it 's the most important thing to me .
yes you have to pay a fine .
yes i do . who are your financial backers ? who are the key competitors ? does the company have a plan for the ipo ? what would you say is the best thing about your product or service ?
yes we do . may i ask where you are located ?
yes i hope it is not for me to start on next month .
i am running at 10 am .
you ca n't be serious .
great ! would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ?
so it can get easy . i think i can make a decision about this .
not really . the company pays for half of the business .
you must have spent a lot of time on the computer .
how about oil or spray ?
why not ? what would you like to do today ?
do you want to take any money out ?
i 'd like to be there on the second floor .
yes that will be fine .
the film will start at 2
is there a problem ?
i 'm not sure . let me see . . .
i 'm sorry to say that you have to give me a credit card .
great ! i 'll see you then .
mike you 're late again .
hi . i 'm here on holiday . could you come with me after a while ?
i never experienced this . why do n't you take a leave of your job and then i keep working as our assistant ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i m sorry ms . mike . i ve just been a secretary for two years . i won t be able to finish my job until i get a new one .
i 'm not sure . let me think about it .
i think you re right about this point . it s not a thing that we have to work on in a project budget . i see the market is a very competitive market . there s nothing like working with .
i see . why do n't you tell me what the problems are looking for and what is the minimum amount you are looking for ?
thank you for coming !
i think it is too late . i could n't stand the subject to anything .
yes i m <unk> about your advertisement for a sales manager in today s newspaper . is this position still open ?
yes but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?
yes i have a lot of previous experiences in sales . i worked in sales departments for two companies since i finished my university .
that sounds fine . please give me your name and phone numbers . i ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . it will most likely be in a couple of days . is it all right for you ?
yes my name is brian and my phone number is 5294870 .
oh very good . you are an expert on it .
your major must be computer .
do you think my educational background suits this position ?
yes i m quite sure .
does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ?
generally speaking training new members is usually necessary . we offer our new employees a oneweek training course .
could you tell something about the job ?
yes of course . you will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints .
oh i see . i believe i can do the job well .
ok . i should have it finished by friday afternoon . then i can check those account over the weekend . we need to have them finished by monday right ?
that s right . we ll finish it just in time . the macy project can wait for the time being . we need to spend several days on that project but it isn t due to be finished until the end of the month s
from next week on we should be in less of a rush .
i m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . everyone deserves it .
don t say that yet . a new project could suddenly appear .
that s true . right . i m going back to the meeting . it s been going on for hours and there s no indication that it ll end soon .
carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is uptodate with their work .
good . i have to go right now . i really hope this meeting doesn t last too long .
they usually go on for ages .
i ll stop by if i have time later . make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines .
i will . enjoy your meeting !
not at all . go ahead .
well you see . i do n't like the office . i do n't like the staff and i 'm afraid you and i do n't get on . so may i put in for a transfer ?
not really so long as you follow all the regulations .
if you make mistakes in your job you 'll be fired . is that right ?
no . everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . the most important thing is to be responsible for your work .
working here involves a busy schedule and overtime . is that true ?
yes . that s true . we are always busy . the company attaches great importance to high efficiency . sometimes we have to work overtime but not always . and we have extra pay for extra work .
it 's interesting . thank you for your help . it 's not just what i expected .
how can you tell the difference ? from what i see they look almost the same .
that s a good idea . we should be in the same boat as long as we are able to solve the problem .
did you know we could play in a play on the internet ? i d be very happy to see you .
it 's not what you 're thinking . it 's a <unk> palace .
you agreed to <unk> me .
i really do n't think it could be a lot less complicated for me .
you ve been very helpful . have you got all the information on the list ?
well i ca n't agree with you . i think we should start with our overseas distributors if we spend more on them .
as you know our marketing is moving into the world to live in . we wish it really makes a great deal to stay in .
it 's the end of the world for the world .
so the film was interesting but i think more about the idea .
it sounds like a really exciting city to live in .
yes but have you made an appointment ahead ?
yes of course . i have an appointment with mr . li .
just a minute please . i ll make a call to the hr office .
ok thank you .
you are welcome . have a nice day .
you mean the network connection ?
yes i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . it took me almost one minute to open it . then there is no response to any click .
i have the same question . i can t send out mails . we d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately .
ok .
you can rest assured that a little tough and simply ca n't stand it .
could you explain what the queue are for ?
wow ! you are really funny . i guess the hell out of this kind are n't they ?
let 's see . . . you are importing fifty containers of textiles from china . they should be able to place your order before the end of next week . it will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of ningpo . the freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in los angeles approximately a month from today . domestic shipping will be your responsibility you can make
fine . we will handle domestic shipping but what about customs ? will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? i hope we do n't run into any problems with the border control .
no the chinese company has that all worked out . with the paperwork you receive with the shipment you should be good to go .
what 's the price ?
i think that this type of apartment is a little high . if you want to have a look we can get it done right ?
what about the period ? it 's not the same as the biggest one you 've got to write down your name and account .
that 's perfect . i 'll just look at the label .
i suggest you use a different font the line and the line . he 's very smart to me .
is that true ?
you 're right . we have people from all over the world taking another day to speak french .
well we have some good red wine and also . .
well maybe you should read the book . i do n't know the story about it .
really ? what did you think of it ?
i do n't think we can make it . you know we have done a good job . we can trust him .
what 's the criteria for you to enjoy ?
the usual place is 550 on american airlines .
i think that would be perfect . are you sure that you will be able to join us ?
i will go into the bank to pay my cash . i 'll need to weigh it .
how long is the tour ?
i think so . are you going to live in a city or a swimming pool ?
wow . that 's true . i guess i 'll have to work on this .
well we have a lot of sweet red wine and a crate of beer .
well what about the tea or the tea ? there are a lot of both the same as the <unk> .

i 've told you a thousand times . we 've had to work on opening our production line and see if we can work something with the companies . i think we 've got to work with a project from the us .
what 's the criteria for work ?
i think we should make a quick decision .
thanks . does your husband have a pen ?
okay .
oh that 's easy . i 'll go for a note and see what i can do .
really ? well i have to go .
i m sure we have . i think we are trying to find something suitable for us .
why do n't you think so ?
i think the job should make use of the professional experience i have obtained and offer me opportunity for advancement .

i feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and i am very interested . what s more your company is outstanding in this field .

i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . johns needs a telephone call from you .
i 'm afraid i ca n't catch what i 'm going to do .
yes i am . that 's why i 'm trying to get into the meeting .
i 'm afraid you ca n't do that . he is away from your desk .

i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
you are right . if you are hired we would like to talk to the police officer of the company to see what they have .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . they think that is must be poor quality if it s that cheap .

well i have to drive to school for a meeting this morning and i 'm going to end up getting stuck in rushhour traffic .
and you 'd better not cry or you 'll have black streaks running down your face .

this is the kitchen . every thing 's new .
i 'm not sure but i do n't know .
yes you 're right . let 's go to another restaurant and see what they have .
it 's hard to believe . no i can stay here for a little while . the boss said he would be back soon .
it s a program about islam . it s very interesting .
wow ! so many people ! where are they and what are they doing ?
they are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . muslims call this pilgrimage haj .
why do they go there ?
muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .
when muslims pray they face towards mecca .
that s right . unfortunately so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .
i heard about that . the pilgrims must walk around a large sacred black stone .
that s right . that s when accidents often happen . the saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims to reduce the chances of accidents .
pilgrimages are common in many <unk> .
yes . in england christian pilgrims might go to canterbury and many christians go to the <unk> on pilgrimages .
isn t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?
i think that place is <unk> . there are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .
do you think that there is something magical about that place ?
personally . i think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that <unk> them . i don t think place is magical in any way .
i have been there for several years .
i wish i could have been there but what is the least i can do ?
it 's interesting .
you said it . the government could help selling new medicines .
well we could always get a burger and i can get a pizza .
what do you think about going to a picnic ?
i always worry that the door is unlocked or that a window is open and that a stranger will come in and steal my things .
ok . i can give them the name of the register .
i 'm sorry sir . but the computer wo n't have any proof of this phone .
i 'm doing fine thanks . what s new with you ?
i 'm doing fine too .
are you getting donations for the job ?
i would love to see you play the piano for free .
yes that s not a problem . our personal automobile consumer loan is just as good as you can .
yes the couple that i have from from now on .
you did ? do you like this class ?
yes . i took a few things to get into the file .
i have ! what happened ?
the company will provide you with better information .
can i take the test again to get this bank card ?
if it 's a job that is available there .
usually it takes two to make an apology for this . i am very pleased with it .

hello ! i was exhausted some studying so i decided to read the newspaper to relax . unfortunately the news is so depressing . there has been another murder in the city center . i m shocked that the police haven t caught the killer yet .
people are starting to get frightened by it . everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .
you mean if they catch the murderer . i m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .
there must have been some good news in the newspaper . i can t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .
well there was one good piece of news . you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?
yes . her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
well they ve got the money and she s going tomorrow for treatment .
i m so happy for the family ! they must be very relieved and excited about that .
i m sure they are . oh and a local man won the lottery . i m so jealous ! i wish it were me ! i buy a lottery ticket every week and i m amazed that i haven t even won a small prize yet . it s so unfair !
don t be moody ! i hope you re not tired because we ve been invited to a party this evening . i know how excited you get about parties .
we have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . most people call them mp s .
each mp belongs to a political party right ?
almost all of them do . a few are independent . that means that they do not belong to a party . if one party more than half of the mp s . they form a government . that means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members .
what s a cabinet ?
this is a small group of peopleperhaps 25 mp s who are usually <unk> . they make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
can any mp make a law ?
any mp can present a law to parliament . the proposed law is debated and voted on . if it is accepted it becomes law .
does it say anything about their country ?
yes it does . we have one more room on the top floor .
how do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
they produce manifesto . these documents which states their policies . some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters .
