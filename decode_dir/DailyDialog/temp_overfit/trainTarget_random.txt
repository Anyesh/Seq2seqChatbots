 i know  .  if a policeman catches you using the cell phone while driving  you will be fined  .  
 here you are  .  
 then what about you  miss  ?  
 what is there besides coffee  ?

 i can do all the housework  .  we do n't need a maid  .  
 have you decided what wine you would like  ?  
 walk straight and turn left  .  
 dogs are nice  but they are really energetic  and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day  .  
 having a dog would probably be too much work for me  then  .  
 actually  i was thinking of something a little more exotic  .  i do n't want a common pet like a dog or a cat  .  
 how about a lizard  ?  are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting  ?  
 bring me one and besides  i would like to have a chicken cream soup  .  
 sure  .  please wait for a moment  .  
 thanks  .  
 we would also like some alcohol before the main dish  .  
 are there the records of michael jackson  ?  
 oh  i see  .  i 'd like to have hot food  .  
 i think you should be more careful next time  .  
 an american one  please  .  i am in a hurry  .

 i would like to have the coffee rum pies  .  
 wait a moment  .  here you are  .  
 sure  .  
 that 's amazing  .  oh  an on line virtual supermarket  ?  
 let 's click to check it out  .  
 sure  .  wait for a moment  .  here you are  .  
 please bring me the chicken chops  .  
 let me see  i am sorry  .  it 's for table 11  .  
 i am sorry for that  .  we will improve the dishes next time  .  
 ok  .  that 's what i can do  .  
 what kind of flowers would you like  ?  
 i do n't like hamburgers  .  they have no taste  .  
 they are behind the door  .  
 her name is fluffy  .  she is a sweet dog  .  
 do you want some dessert  ?  
 make it two  .  
 well  would you please clean the livingroom  ?  you know i 'm too busy  .  
 thank you for joining us  !  now let 's see some pictures and know more about kung fu  .  
 it 's for the drinks  .  
 it  s because of my son  .  dick keeps getting on my nerves 
 wait a moment  .  i will calculate it for you  .  your bill comes to  36  .  
 ok  .

 yes  it is  .  it should be enough for any student needs you might have  .  what department are you in  ?  
 thirty percent  ?  
 yes  it 's a macintosh  .  it 's apple  .  mcintosh and apple are the same thing  .  
 i 'm sorry  but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment  .  
 that 's not true  .  most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh  .  they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing  and that is what students mostly do  .  may i ask where you 're from  ?  
 how would you like it  ?  
 of course  .  
 fine  .  i 'll be ready in a minute  .  
 yes  .  what 's your size  ?  
 although it is easy to ride  the condition of the road surface should also be paid attention to  such as places being put together and full of gullies  .  if the condition permits  it is better to be equipped with helmet  eye shades  ankle shield  knee shield and elbow shield  .  
 i do n't know  .  what do you want to do  ?  
 what kinds do you have  ?  
 last time i tried a pin curl perm and a foam permanent  .  set the wave a little looser than usual  please  .  
 but i see people sweat a lot doing yoga too  .  
 i 've looked for  but i did n't see any black ink  .  
 thank you  .  i never can find my way around this store  .  
 this one  .  it is of the best quality and excellently tailored as well  .  you may try it on  .  
 but it is really worthwhile  .

 how many did you say  sir  ?  
 that will be six dollars  .  out of tenseven  eight  nine  ten  .  thank you  .  
 wait a minute  .  i found there were two printings  .  the paperback books must be much cheaper  .  
 no  it is n't  .  
 no  .  it 's only a fiveminute walk  .  you ca n't miss it  .  
 do you have this shirt in a small  ?  
 oh dear  !  that 's terrible  !  what was in your wallet  ?  
 yes  i 've already done that  and they said they 'd look for it  .  but we 're leaving soon and i need my visa and identity cards badly  .  
 wait a minute  !  my uncle lives in beijing and he lives very close to the theatre  .  i 'll telephone him and ask him to go there to inquire about it  .  you 'd better have breakfast now and i 'll meet you later  .  
 no  i 'll be right back  .  
 one yuan  .  
 ok  that 's right  .  
 then i 'll take it  .  
 250 yuan  .  
 what you 're paying for  madam  is the ingredients  .  it provides a soft and perfect finish coverage with a weightless feel  .  
 all right  .  how much is it  ?  
 but they do n't let you have goods on approval  .  
 here 's a check for ten dollars  .

 the color i use now is rose  .  how much does this rose foundation cost  ?  the 100ml bottle  .  
 i understand  .  
 well  i 'm not so sure  .  most of my makeup is brown  .  
 sure  .  are you wearing any makeup  ?  
 you have n't seen the sights yet  have you  ?  
 no  i 'm open to suggestions  .  
 cool  !  anything else  ?

 good morning  .  
 but how 's the sound quality  ?  
 it 's true  .  
 that 's fine  .  
 i 'm afraid we do n't  .  but i 'm sure you 'll enjoy our lunch special  .  
 yes  .  mike lee  .  and put me as close as possible to the stage  please  .  
 we like a larger wardrobe  .  
 will it take long  ?  
 yes  ?  
 you have good taste  .  it 's made of red wood  .  
 oh  i like red wood  .  how much do you charge for it  ?  
 thank you  .  
 really  ?  let me have a look at it  .  mm  .  ok  .  let me change it for another one  .  
 i see  .  thanks a lot  .  
 just a moment  please  .  yes  you can have a seat  .  
 good  .  how much is a oneway ticket  ?  
 you will find a taxi stand the street corner  .

 that 's a lot  .  what did you bring with you  ?  
 i just went to bed  !  
 yes  what size do you want  ?  
 sure  .  
 i haver run out of gas  .  
 premium  please  .  by the way  please do n't fill it up  .  two gallons will be fine  .  
 i 'm afraid you ca n't  .  you 'll have to go out there and walk around  .  
 how much is it  ?  
 yes  .  
 15 copies for each diploma  .  
 yes  ?  
 three seats  please  .  
 sure  sir  .  how many of you are there  ?  
 can we bring drinks by ourselves  ?  
 i know  .  i intend to go to the store today  .  
 really  ?  then  i guess i won  t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab  ?  
 actually  you might because there  s a big convention in town this weekend  .  
 are you going to have anything to eat  ?  
 french toast sounds good  .  what are you going to order  ?  
 ok  here is your change  .  
 here is  200  keep the change  please  .  
 i will show you  .  
  90  .  
 how much does the green one cost  ?  
 i 'd like a little sugar  please  .  
 no  this is n't  .  
 ok  .  what are you going to have to eat  ?  
 well  i like everything about it except the price  .  
 we have had a window table reserved for you  .  this way  please  .  
 i share the same opinion  .  you are overweight so it 's hard for you to buy clothes  .  
 and what would you like after that  ?  
 yes  i 'd like another cup of coffee  .  
 please give me a piece of pie first  .  
 which would you rather have  beef or chicken  ?  
 coffee  please  .  
 only black coffee  .  
 really  ?  let me see  .  
 yes  of course  .  it seems made to measure  .  
 well  i think that one fits me better  .  what 's the price  ?  
 i think so too  .  how much is it  ?  
 could i have look at that pair of canvas shoes  ?  they look nice  .  
 it 's right here  .   100  .  
 you come back here with me tomorrow  and it 's my treat  !  
 it 's up to you  .  
 are they clean  ?  
 i know i should  but that place is n't very convenient  .  you have to wait for a long time  .  
 well  what about  70 with a scarf  ?  
 yes  i want a pair of sport shoes  jordan  .  
 red cooked carp and rape with fresh mushrooms  .  
 sourpeppery soup  .

 i 'm looking for the cameras  .  
 can i smell it  ?  
 thanks a lot  .  we arrived at kaohsiung international airport  .

 gentleman  !  hah  !  fat chance  !  hah  !  eat your heart out  sucker  !  hah  !  
 and for your entree  ?  
 around five thirty  .  
 i 'll have the lamb chops  welldone  please  .  
 i 'd like to choose one game for myself and one for my younger sister  .  
 i see  but games are played in different ways  .  i 'm wondering what type of games do you like to play  ?  
 do n't worry  .  most male customers choose first person shooting  real time strategy  action or sports  while female customers prefer simulating  action or role playing  .  shooting  action and sports games require flexible movements and real time strategy usually needs overall consideration  .  
 i like first person shooting and action more than other types of games  .  
 if so  counter strike and might  magic are good alternatives  .  counter strike is one of the hottest shooting games and might  magic series are popular among girls because the game has attractive plot and interesting scenes  .  
 and can i have some ketchup  please  ?  
 me too  .  is there a place nearby that we can get something to eat  ?  
 did it cost very much 
 okay  .  i 'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad  .  
 what 's on the menu today  ?  
 i 'd rather take stewed cabbage with beef  .  
 that 's good  we can share what we have  .  here we are  .  you go ahead  .  
  they get everything ready  here is a free table  .  let 's sit down  .  help yourself to some fish please  .  is n't it delicious and appetizing  ?  
 i see  .  you people from south prefer sweet  do n't you  ?  
 yes  i like the fish cooked in sweet and sour sauce best  .  try some beef  please  .  
 thank you  .  i 'm through with one steamed bread and i 'd like a second helping  .  
 actually  i 'd like a booth by the window if that 's possible  .  
 well  i am afraid i do n't bring my passport with me today  .  can you save it for us until tomorrow  ?  
 that 's really cheap  .  i will take it  .  
 have you brought your receipt  ?  
 they 're right over there  next to the dictionaries  .  
 certainly  .   he brings her the sauce  here you are  .  can get you anything else  ?  
 thank you  .  
 cool  !  we can watch ally mcneal  !  
 keep your back straight and look forward  .  good  .  do about 3 sets of 20  .  
 yes  .  
 you 're welcome  .  
 let 's see  .  if we have it  it should be over there under m  .   he looks through the cds  .   hmm  it looks like we 've sold out of that one  but we should be getting some more copies in soon  .  if you want  we can order it for you  .  
 that 's okay  i 'll just check back later  .  do you have the new sting album  ?  
 that 's a good idea  .  let 's bring our trunks and towels  .  
 well  i use breast stroke for long distance  crawl or free style for short distance and back stroke just for fun  .  
 that is good of you  .  
 over there  .  
 i 'd like a trim  .  
 cut it short in the front  but leave it long in the back  .  leave just a little over the ears  .  
 yes  but it takes a while to find things  .  it 's not organized as carefully as a regular store  .  
 usually a clothes company will send their overstock to an outlet  .  the prices are very low  .  but you may find faulty products here too  .  
 do you have your negatives  ?  
 four by six  except this one  .  i want a ten by thirteen print of this one  .  
 no  you know i ca n't bear eating less  .  
 how 's it going on  ?  
 we take visa and master card  .  
 shall we check your oil and tires  ?  
 i just checked the oil myself  but you can check the tires  .  
 hmm  .  that 's not too bad  .  does it have a stopwatch  ?  
 uh  no  .  analog watches do n't come with stopwatches  .  you 'll have to get a digital if you want a stopwatch  .  
 3 . 00 yuan  .  
 well  i think this one is a little too small  .  would you please bring me a bigger one  ?  
 put it there  !  in senior high schools  we used to play on desks in the classroom  when no vacant tables were available  .  likewise  the racket may take a variety of forms  too . anything that resembles a racket  from a plank to cardboard or even a hardcover book  may be used as a racket  .  
 this one fits me well but it is too expensive  can you make it a little cheaper  ?  
 but then you have to change the litter box  .  
 it 's better than picking up dog poop  .  
 well  they just look a bit funny  .  but far from making a laughing stock out of you  .  
 did i do it right  ?  
 5 minutes or so  .  
 yes  you get off at the square  .  
 i think  maybe  it takes a real kung fu master to give a more fair assessment  meanwhile  i am no more than a beginner  .  but i really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life  .  
 are you sure  ?  
 of course  !  swimming can help you stay in shape by targeting all parts of your body  .  
 you will make it if you persist in it  .  
 i want to change my hairstyle  .  what would you suggest  ?  
 would you like to have a perm  ?  
 oh  absolutely  .  
 i would like to have a dishwasher and central air conditioning  .  
 yes  .  it  s only 5 minutes walk from the campus  .  
 i 'd like to have a look at your air conditioners  .  hum  this one looks pretty good  .  
 yes  it  s this summer  s bestseller  .  
 we provide free delivery and installation  .  
 very good  .  i  ll take it  .  
  no response  silence  
 i see  .  thanks for your drive  .  
 no . but there are quite many cars  .  
 thank you  .  
 can you please speed up  ?  i am catching the train  .  
 i am sorry  .  there is a speed limit  .  
 sure  .  here it is  .  
 how about the one next to the black gloves  ?  it 's very similar to the one you like  .  
  at counter 1  .   do you take parcels here  ?  
 how much is a postcard  ?  
 thank you  .  
 which leg do you want to have  right leg or left one  ?  
 why do you say so many thanks  ?  
 i know they are n't good for you  but they are cheap  convenient  and fairly tasty  .  
 yeah  why not  .  do you have all the ingredients  ?  
 i bought all the ingredients this morning  so let 's start  !  
 what do we do first  ?  
 yes  .  once it gets hot  put a little oil in it  add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes  .  
 thank you  .  
 would you like to go now or later  ?  
 i want to get cigarettes  .  
 that 's very nice of you  .  i guess i could use some help  .  
 i 'm not sure  .  
 looks nice  .  okay  i 'll take it  .  
 yes  .  we 'll also apply some of our special day cream that will moisturize our skin and protect it from the sun  .  
 ok  just follow me  .  
 it 's no trouble at all  .  i 'll carry this suitcase for you  .  
 yes  .  but you need to pay  60 for it each month  .  
 yes  .  we set up the new alarm system a few months ago  .  
 of course we do  .  it is the landlord  s responsibility  .  
 are smoke detectors provided  ?  
 yes  .  everything is fine in the apartment  .  but i know nothing about this area  .  could i ask you some questions  ?  
 can you tell me the postal code for this building  ?  
 where can i change the address on my driver  s license  ?  
 so  it  s easy to get to the office from here  .  from your apartment  just drive along king street east for about one kilometer and you  ll see a threestory blue building on your right  .  that  s the department of motor vehicles building where you can change your driver  s license  .  
 i like it  .  
 i like it a lot but i need to talk with my wife  .  can you hold it for me for two days  ?  
 good  i am sure it will work if you can persist  .  
 i hope so  .  would you like to join me  ?  
 come on  !  rest breads rust  .  
 okay  .  thank you very much  .  
 you  re welcome  .  
 let 's take the met  .  lt 's faster and cheap  .  
 5o dollars  .  later you have to place your ticket near the sensor  .  
 why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on  ?  
 yes  i think i 'd like the green mask in the middle  .  
 are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift  ?  
 they look delicious  .  i think she 'll be pleased  .  
 what dress size do you wear  ?  
 why  ?  
 no  .  he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room  .  
 it 's on the fourth floor  .  
 thank you  .  
 well  why do n't you go on a diet  ?  
 yes  maybe i should  .  
 i think you 're right  .  thank you  .  
 yes  .  how much is it to send these things to shanghai by regular delivery  ?  
 it depends on the weight of these things  .  generally speaking  we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram  .  
 ok  .  see you later  .  
 do you want it for yourself or for your girlfriend  ?  
 no  i have no girlfriend  .  
 what size are you looking for  ?  
 you  re welcome  .  
 thank you very much  .  
 okay  i  ll take four  please  .  you saved me a lot  .  
 so  i can have five for five dollars  ?  
 stop beating around the bush  .  will you quit or not  ?  
 thank you  .  
 oh  bathroom blues  .  
 you never worked out  ?  
 i know what you mean  .  i 'm like a yoyo  .  
 what about this one  ?  it sells like hot cakes  .  
 levis  .  it 's the latest fashion  .  
 just a little steak  uh  .  .  .  snack  ?  a bowl of clam chowder  ?  
 you 're right  .  but if i get too thin  my mom will make me go to the hospital again  .  
 i think you 're hallucinating  !  what are you talking about  ?  
 well  could you bring me all the styles of pullovers  ?  i am not quite sure which one i will buy  .  
 get in  .  i will take you there  .  
  50  .  
 you have really good taste  .  it 's the best seller right now  .  
 you 're back already  .  that sure was quick  .  
 ok  .  all the registered airmail packages can be received in 5 working days  .  
 it 's 500 dollars  .  
 i think i 'll have a glass of wine  .  let 's see  .  .  .  they have red wine  white wine and port  .  they even have sangria  !  it 's the happy hour special  .  
 sure  .  the fitting room is in the corner  .  
 sounds like a good idea  .  i love to play on the jungle gym  .  
 i think so  .  last time i saw dandelions and ladybugs near the pond  .  
 it 's really healthy to do some exercise there  .  the air is fresher and it 's romantic to watch the sunset with your lover  .  
 there are different types  .  which one do you like best  ?  
 well i have a guest ticket  .  you can use it  .  
 ok  .  
 what about this one  ?  it 's a very nice 3  piece suit  .  
 that 's good  .  i will take it  .  
 come on  !  in the two hours we 've been here  you have n't sung even one song  !  
 i heard it is included in the four major arts of china  is it  ?  
 i know it is quite different from western chess  .  
 well  i think the color is a little too bright  .  
 ok  .  i am hungry  too  .  i like their milkshake  .  they 're very creamy and tasty  .  
 yup  they have good french fries as well  .  not very thick  but crispy enough  .  you should try them with some mayonnaise sauce  .  that is the belgium style  .  you will love it  .  
 sure  .  on a chessboard  fire is much more intensive  .  it has a smaller board  while those bigger pieceschariots  horses and bishopscan cover longer distances  .  
 yes  .  which one is the latest  ?  
 of course  i have  .  there is one in my old house  .  and i have another one from college at my parents house  .  
 glad to meet you  .  this way  please  .  
 nicholas  ?  nicholas nickleby  ?  no  .  he does n't live here any more  .  he 's moved to morecambe  .  
 when do you have lunch  ?  
 certainly  .  after all  i 've been here for two years  .  it 's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to chinese dinner utensils  .  though  i do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a chinese dinner table  .  
 maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate  .  they resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices  .  it 's very inauspicious  and might enrage all present  .  
 i think so  .  
 and when do you get home at night  ?  
 oh  these  ?  hmm  .  .  .  yellow is n't a good color for me  .  
 it 's  42  !   !  that 's expensive  !  
 i will  but please hurry  .  
 tina  you should have more nutritious food  .  do n't eat these crisps any more  .  
 no  i 'm not asking for money  i 'm asking for your advice  .  
 mi stands for middle initial  .  
 always print clearly  and fill in the bubbles completely  .  
 what do you want to do  ?  
 that will make him so happy  .  
 do you know which one he would like  ?  
 one dollar  .  drop it in the box  .  move to the rear of the bus  .  there are plenty of seats in the rear  .  
 wait  .  i want to ask you if this bus goes down fifth avenue as far as greenwich village  .  
 that 's right . move along  please . there are more people waiting to get on . move to the rear  .  
 but i thought this was the right bus to go to washington square park  .  
 how about the cinema  ?  
 how big was it  ?  
 of course  .  we gave him a big carrot for a nose  .  
 what 's that  ?  
 oh  .  what good is that  ?  i thought it gave you free money  .  
 no  thanks a lot  .  i 'll try it myself  .  
 there you go  .  
 i 'm attending a conference in sydney this week  .  remember  ?  
 yes  four o 'clock in the morning  .  
 channel two  .  a tv series was showing on it  .  the name of the series is huanzhu gene 
 it 's a quarter to eight  .  i 'm going to work  .  
 sure  .  you mean this one  ?  
 i like the design  but do n't particularly care for the colour  .  do you have that in other colours  too  ?  
 could i have a slice of pumpkin pie  ?  
 sure  .  coming right up  .  
 you 're welcome  .  
 laptops are more expensive  right  ?  
 they said i need a new hard drive  .  
 no  my hard drive is easy to remove and replace  .  
 that 's nice  .  
 that 's a good idea  .  
 do you want me to wake you in an hour  ?  
 i do n't think i 'm going to dream about anything  .  i 'm really tired  .  
 i think i know  because this happened before  .  
 then a pc should be enough  .  macintoshes are better for graphics  but they also cost a bit more  .  
 this one is also really cool  .  it 's a scifi game in which you have to stop an alien invasion  .  the graphics on this one are spectacular  .  
 okay  i guess that 's it  .  let 's go pay for this stuff  .  
 yes  .  when i spread it out back home  i found this hole  .  
 here it is  .  
 fine  .  
 yes  .  what can i do for you  ?  
 better visit the supermarket then  .  we 'll need some other things for the party  .  get some vanilla ice cream  some butter and some vinegar and twelve bottles of beer  .  
 i 'll see you later then  .  
 does that suggest diners avoid speaking much  ?  the same is true in the west  .  
 correct  .  show respect for the older people  .  conventionally  before the meal starts  the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one  .  others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite  .  toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other  .  
 any other rules to observe in order to keep modest  ?  
 if i remember right  she likes music  skiing  and reading  .  
 what a pity that the traditional teahouses  as depicted by lao she  keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis  .  it is not easy to find an oldfashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people 's spending power either  .  teahouses of today all feature a cozy  comfortable environment  and highquality services  but can easily cost you a good deal  just like a coffee bar  .  
 you 've got a point there  .  it is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit  .  there is no need to ask if he needs it or not  or if he wants something else  .  it might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea  .  
 what does that imply  then  ?  
 no  the roses will be fine  .  
 yes  .  i would like to place a collect call  .  
 can you tell me the name and number of the person you want  ?  
 terry and his number is 4562325 8  .  
 then let 's go to that store  .  
 i 've a driver mate in my car  !  
 let 's just park here  .  
 what  s the time  ?  
 positive  .  i  ll put the radio on  .  
 you have gone against the traffic rules  .  
 things change every minute  .  
 why  ?  anything special there  ?  
 that 's terrific  .  i ca n't wait to check it out  .  
 i 'm not going in the wrong direction  am i  ?  
 may i take a bus to get there  ?  
 what do you mean  ?  i ca n't understand  .  
 twenty minutes exactly  .  
 yes . we re interested in seeing the rooms for rent  .  
 oh  how nice . they re bright rooms and the house is very quiet  .  
 and there 's no one living over us  .  
 the plumbing seems ok  too  .  
 thanks  i like it too  .  i bought it at the nearby department store  .  
 you 're so careless  billy  .  
 i 've done it for you  .  
 we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic  .  
 surely it is  .  getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness  .  
 you bet it  !  
 well  it 's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in america  .  it 's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny  .  i think you 'd like it  .  
 and the host announced that he won it all  !  
 i bought it online  .  
 well  are there any other advantages  ?  
 yes  .  what is the rent  ?  
 yes  and the rent includes utilities  .  
 that 's good  .  when can i go to see the house  ?  
 you 're right here  bus station  we are in the center of the city  .  
 you wo n't go to work today  steven  it 's sunday  .  come and have breakfast now  .  
 oh  nice to see you  .  the apartment is on the tenth floor  .  the previous tenant just moved out yesterday  .  
 you 'll see one at the corner on your right  .  
 what about the surrounding area  ?  
 i have  actually  i  ve always wanted to build my dream home myself  .  
 well  i think we should save more  .  if we save more money we can retire earlier and enjoy our life better  .  
 we put  500 into the savings account  and  750 into our stock account  .  
  3 075  .  our paychecks is  3 300  combined  .  that means we do n't have any receipts for  225  .  
 i see  .  thanks a lot  .  
 there is one next to the post office  round the corner  .  
 is it far  ?  
 let me look  .  let  s see  .  .  .  they  ve got one in blue  green  pink  black  .  .  .  and white  .  here you are  .  
 oh  no wonder you are healthy  .  
 well  if you want to live in london  you have to pay the price  !  
 thank god  we have n't encountered a burglar  .  i hope that our house is secure against burglary  .  
 all right  steven  .  do you have a flashlight  ?  
 no  but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months  so for the first 6 months we pay 12 month 's rent each month  .  
 do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent  ?  
 good luck  !  
 how many rooms does your house have  ?  
 i 'd be up for that  !  
 i hope so  .  
 when you buy clothes  you must think about the material  quality and price  .  
 i can  t promise  but i  ll do my best  .  
 i see  .  you must have more rest  .  
 let 's see  i 've got about  50 to get me through the weekend  .  i can only spare about  20  .  i would give you more if i had it  i just do n't have much money to my name right now  .  
 thanks  .  could you tell me where i should deposit my bag  ?  
 the checkroom is just behind the front door  .  
 thank you  .  how much is it  ?  
 let 's take a look at the menu so we can order  .  do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share  ?  
 what would you rather have  samosas or poppadoms  ?  
 well  let 's get a plate of those then  .  
 i think i might have a dahl  .  
 ok  shall i flag down the waitress  ?  
 its already very cheap  .  let 's make it 6 000 yuan  .  
 sorry  you can only pay cash  .  
 are the snack foods in that area  too  ?  
 i  m a large  .  
 sure  .  large or medium  ?  
 thank you  sir  .  have a nice day  .  
 ok  .  could you give me a receipt  ?  
 that 's better  .  this way we will both have money to take a cab home  otherwise  you would probably have to walk  .  
 just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week  ok  ?  
 i 'm going to use my atm card  .  
 done  .  
 paper or plastic  ?  
 yes  i remember it was inspired by a new york times bestseller of the same name  .  
 and everyone knows that americans favorite food is the hamburger  is n't it  ?  
 i do n't think that will do  .  how about the one at your back  ?  
 no  i do n't like the brown one  .  
 the blue one  ?  
 centrum  ?  we have bottles of thirty and one hundred tablets  .  which kind do you want  ?  
 can i have a look at them  ?  
 are they cheaper  ?  
 actually  i ate too much pork yesterday  .  i fancy a change  .  
 ok  a bottle of the house red please  !  
 really  ?  but they 're delicious  !  
 alex  you do n't know what to order  .  let 's go to a chinese restaurant together next time  .  
 that sounds great  .  
 you  re welcome  .  would you like some cold dishes  ?  
 ok  and anything to drink  ?  maybe some jasmine tea  ?  
 oh it  s printed the ticket already  .  thank you very much  .  
 you  re welcome  .  
 ok  do they have a delivery service  ?  
 is it expensive to make outofstate calls  ?  
 of course  .  i want to buy some night cream for my mom  and some masques for myself  .  
 some black mascara  moisturizing orion  eye cream crystal lipstick  a two color eye shadow pack  styling hairspray  and a cosmetics bag  .  
 oh really what  s happening  ?  
 no  thanks  .  
 anyway  how was your such  catherine  ?  
 i guess you 're right  .  more often than not  people go there only for convenience  .  the foods may taste good  but generally speaking  they are high in calories  salt and fat  .  
 oh no  .  i broke your vase accidentally  .  
 of course  .  first dial the code 011 to get an international line  .  then you dial taiwan's country code 
 now you should know the rest  .  do n't forget to dial taipei 's city code  .  
 it 's fortyfive yuan  .  
 can you make it much cheaper  ?  
 what about the quality of the pictures  ?  
 wow  !  what about the memory  ?  
 it has a builtin hardwired memory  but i like to use the 64mb media cards that come with it  .  i can download everything onto the hard drive and then edit and enhance with different software  .  it takes fantastic pictures that i can either print out or email to my friends  .  
 that 's where you 'll find things like salt and pepper  .  
 oh  i see  .  
 it 's got a builtin video camera so you can see the person you 're talking to . it also takes stills and i can use the email mode to send digital pictures straight to my friend 's phone  !  
 i 'm looking for some earrings for my wife as a wedding anniversary gift  .  
 sure  madam  .  but may l know how old he is  ?  
 here you are  .  you  ll find the sugar just over there  .  
 i want to have a try later  .  
 i see  .  
 sorry  .  we 're out of size l 's  .  
 ok  but junk food has many disadvantages  .  as junk food contains high amount of oil and fat  you 'll feel sleepy  but not be able to concentrate when you have a lot of it  .  
 let me see  .  you could exercise more to keep fit  .  
 i  m sorry to hear that  .  cancelling the appointment is no problem  .  thank you for your call  .  
 hi  .  this is amy yang  .  i  m calling for a home phone cancellation  .  i  m moving out next month  .  
 i will  .  thanks  .  
 sure  .  where do you want to go  ?  are you in the mood for anything in particular  ?  
 dumplings again  ?   !  oh  amy  let 's try something new  !  
 well  what do you have in mind  ?  
 maybe we can try yuanyang pot this time  .  you can choose the nonspicy soup base  .  
 sounds great  .  do they serve noodles  ?  i am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well  .  
 you  re welcome  .  
 it  s to the east of tiananmen square  .  
 we pitched a tent in the night  waiting for the sunrise  .  wow  !  it was too beautiful  .  
 i 'd love to  .  
 ok  i  ll pay by card then  .  
 but there 's no hot water after 10 at night  .  sometimes i like to have a hot shower before bed  .  especially in the winter  .  it feels good  .  
 entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage  .  
 it is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of comfortable  !  
 all right  .  i want to take a shower first  i  m exhausted  .  
 would you like anything else  ?  
 here is 200 yuan  .  the charge is for you  .  
 thank you  .  welcome to call again  .  goodbye  .  
 well  people from asia to europe all enjoy tea  .  
 no problem  .  hope to see you again soon  .  
 yes  i 'll be with you in a minute  .  here 's your bill  sir  .  it 's 480 yuan altogether  .  
 that 's for the wine  .  
 i see  .  
 roast beef  of course  .  that 's what i ordered  .  
 yes  this system over here is on sale for  1000  .  as you can see  all of the components are brandname  .  
 yes  i 'd like them sent to this address  .  
 would you like some more  ?  
 2244 forest drive  .  
 that 's okay  .  well  let me think  .  how about a mystery novel  ?  
 all right  sir  .  they should be ready for you by tomorrow afternoon  .  
 i 'd like to see some mandarin textbooks too  .  do you have any  ?  
 thank you  .  
 yes  please  .  
 this will be fine  thanks  .  
 thank you  .  
 i 'm fine for now  thanks  .  
 well  there are a lot of storybooks upstairs in our children's section  .  some are written for young children  others for teens  .  maybe some of them will suit your needs  .  
 and would you like an appetizer before your meal  ?  the soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup  .  
 no  i 'm stuffed  .  i 'm ready for the check  .  
 oh  i see it  .  thanks for your help  .  
 relly  ?  that 's amazing  .  
 yes  it really is  .  after having vegetarian diet  .  i have much more energy  i need less sleep  i feel calmer  .  i can maintain an ideal body weight without worrying about how much i eat and i can think more clearly  .  
 i agree  .  it makes it difficult to breathe  .  
 all right  .  
 i  d like extra prints made of these photos  .  
 an acoustic one  .  
 in that case  how about this one  ?  it  s inexpensive but it  s still well made and easy to play  .  
 don  t mention it  .  
 will we be there soon  ?  
 i don  t think i  ll need a polaroid . does this 35mm camera have an automatic flash  ?  
 yes  it does . but you can turn it off if you want  .  
 well  i guess for  400 a month i should n't expect an all bills paid apartment  .  
 are you sure that i can get there in time if we take the less heavy route  ?  
 do you know where dawanglu is  ?  
 yes  i know it  .  
 buckle up the belt  please  .  
 i never eat breakfast though  .  
 that 's a big mistake  you should always have a good breakfast  .  you will not run your car without fuel  and yet you expect your body to work without food  .  
 i never thought about it that way  .  
 oh  yes  .  i know where it is  .  
 i am sorry too  .  i know we 've been talking about this beach trip for a while  .  i should have told bob i was busy this weekend  .  
 what 's the problem  ?  
 oh  four or five  .  how much is the rent for this apartment  ?  
 rents are very high in downtown area  .  
 sure  .  what  s your favorite number  ?  
 as soon as possible  .  can i have it right now  ?  
 ah  ah  you promised  and remember  ?  
 well  i remember walking pass the baker shop  .  
 no problem  .  
 when did you buy it from our store  ?  
 you  re welcome  .  
 um  .  it  s delicious  .  
 where did you have it done  ?  
 my sister did it  .  when did you get yours cut  ?  
 meat  i think  .  
 fine  and after dinner  shall we go to a disco  ?  
 thank you  but i prefer the fish  .  
 you  re welcome  .  
 but yesterday you said you would rent it  .  
 oh  french dressing  .  
 we still prefer french dressing  .  
 is she strict  ?  
 david  stop dreaming  .  it  s time to do your homework  .  
 of course  !  where are the things  ?  
 yes  .  i believe you have a luncheon meeting this coming wednesday  .  could you give me some more information about that  ?  
 mmm  that sounds very interesting  .  
 you should get off at the first shi da stop  .  
 i just saw her down the street  .  i don  t know where she is  .  i don  t know  .  .  .  
 ok  .  
 how about the cinema  ?  
 i had it when i left the house  .  i had it when we start to get the hotdog  .  
 ok  .  let  go back to the hotdog stand  .  
 thanks  .  
 something awful happened  .  we went to the portobello road  and someone stole my handbag  .  
 no  .  only a few pounds  .  but my passport was in the bag  .  that  what i  m really worried about  .  
 not at all  .  i  ll be glad to do it  .  
 can i print it  ?  
 or maybe make the beds  .  
 tom  darling  .  you 'll try not to be late for dinner tonight  wo n't you  ?  please  !  
 no  there is plenty of gas  .  i filled it up yesterday  .  
 it doesn  t matter  .  go back the way you came  .  after about five kilometers  you  ll see a hotel on the side of the road  .  it  s a big one  .  you can  t miss it  .  
 yes  i think so  .  it doesn  t close until 5 o  clock  .  you still have plenty of time  .  
 my pleasure  and have a good time  !  
 150 yuan for hard seats  .  
 sir  ?  
 and about time too  !  
 well  i 'm not quite ready  .  
 thanks for the warning  .

 thank you for your warning  .  
 be careful of yourself  .  
 oh  they look nice  .  may i try that black one on  ?  
 yes  i ca n't sleep well every night  .  
 you should get plenty of sleep  .

 oh  to rent  .  
 yes  i think so  .  there is also an interesting one . it s opposite the park  .  
 of course  .  here you are  .  can i take your order now  ?

 it 's a well furnished eatin kitchen  .  the stove and the icebox are in good order  and the plumbing is ok  too  .  
 what are you going to do  ?  are you going to work late  ?  
 i  d like to go to the railway station please  .  
 let  s drive off this road  .  
 don  t worry  .  there  s plenty of time yet  .  
 fine . how long does it take to get to 82nd street  ?  
 about fifteen minutes  .  it 's not far . are you a stranger in new york  ?  
 you 'll soon get accustomed to it  .  it 's not difficult  .  well  here 's the bus . fortunately  it 's not full  .  
 thank you for the information  .  
 could you please tell me when we get there  ?  
 no  a no  .  50 will take you right there  .  
 so when's the next fortyfour  ?  will it be here soon  ?  
 must i catch a number 7 bus to get there  ?  
 number 13 buses run much more frequently  do n't they  ?  
 thank you  henry  .  i 'll get a number 13  .

 i want to make an omelet  so actually this is really silly  i 've never made one before  .  how do you make an omelet  ?  
 ok  .  and keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over  you 'll only have to cook that side lightly  .  put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese  .  
 and must i go back to school  ?  
 no  you need n't do that  .  you 'd better get a parttime job somewhere and go to evening classes  .  
 who knows  !  that might come to later  .  
 we 'll have to get you to a hospital  .  i can ride you on the back of my bike  .  
 alright  i 'm twisting it around  .  you tell me when to stop  .

 i do it  too  .  you know  sometimes when we eat  my child would pull a dish towards him and grab it with his hands and eat  .  and if it were something he doesn  t like  he would spit it out and throw it into other dishes  .  he does it very often  .  i really get mad  .  i can  t help spank him sometimes  .  
 mm  let me see  .  i think there are 2 in the bedroom  and 1 each in the living room and kitchen  .  
 also  are they allowing the apartment  ?  
 i can never forget that  .  i bought you five candies  but i was so anxious that i forgot to give them to you  .  you did n't get them until we parted  .  then they had already melted down for i held them the whole time  .  
 ok  well  i can teach you how i make them  which is the same way my father and grandmother make them  which is a little special  .

 did it ever shrink or fade  ?  generally speaking  the darkcolored clothes always fade away gradually  .  
 it 's very simple  .  divide the clothes by the colors  and wash them in cold water  .  if you 've got some special stains on them like sugar  coffee or something else please let the dry cleaner know  .

 hey  do n't be so pathetic  .  it 's a maximal sports show  .  what else can they do to attract more visitors  ?  stop all this fuss and enjoy the show  .

 good point  .  ok  let 's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us  .  
 i asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month  .  
 yes  .  i think so  .  it  s not a very expensive apartment  .  it  s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for  .  the rooms are quite large too  .  
 you look a bit pale  do n't you  ?  
 i sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me  .  
 yes  you do  .  lift the weight up  keeping your arms straight all the time  .  
 sorry  .  you know the rules  .  
 not even for an hour  ?  
 perhaps you left that at school  .  
 no  i had it when i left school this afternoon  .  
 well  .  didn  t you go around to the smith after school  ?  you might have left it there  .  
 but she can  t be home now  .  she might have gone to the library  .  
 good question  .  yes  he has a moustache  but no beard  .  
 well  i do n't find her attractive  but i 'm sure you will disagree  .  
 meat  i think  .  
 if it is not to your satisfaction  i  ll certainly bring you another  .  but i  m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes  .  
 weight  ?  
 well  he had a jacked or a plage shirt  .  you know the kind of number jack wear  .  
 sounds not good  .  i wo n't take it  .  
 thank you  but i prefer the fish  .  
 you must n't pick it in this place  .  
 it 's a private garden  .  
 what sort of price are you asking  ?  
 my name 's donald eakins  .  
 it 's 1446 pine street  .  
 yes  i can see it  .  but what 's on it  ?  
 you bet  .  this is the nicest room in the district  .  you know what  i just had all the walls repainted last month  .  
 how much is it  ?  
 exactly five dollars  .  
 you are welcome  sir  .  goodbye  .  
 oh  yes  mrs . saxton  .  please take a seat here  .  
 sure  .  we just got some  .  they 're uptodate  .  
 all right  madam  it 's your turn  .  what will it be today  ?  
 would you like me to blowdry your hair  ?  
 by all means  .  
 good morning  .  i 'd like a business suit made with this material  .  
 yes  that is why i usually choose dark colours for my business suits  .  
 well  a business suit usually takes ten days time  .  but in your case  we 'll try to have it ready sooner  .  how about coming for your fitting on the 8th  ?  then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th  ?  
 no  madam  .  i do n't think i do  .  
 yes  i 'd like to look at some suits  .  
 thanks  .  it 's comfortable  .  well  how much is it  please  ?  
 yes  i see  .  i 'll take it  .  here 's  200  .

 i 'm afraid i do n't  .  i 'm quite new in town  .  
 well  do you know where the post office is  ?  
 well  thank you very much  i hope i can find it  .  
 yes  .  go straight ahead till you come to the traffic lights  turn left there and it 's the first turning on the right  .  
 well  what kind of books does she like  ?  
 i hope so  .  i 'm looking for some material for a paper i 'm writing  and i 'm not quite sure where to look  .  
 here 's the receipt  .  
 just a moment  i 'll look up the rate for airmail letters to south america  .  
 yes  .  all you have to do declare the value of the package and decide how much you want to insure it for  .  
 we open at eightthirty in the morning and close at fivethirty in the afternoon  .  
 yes  we have both the paperback and hardcover  .  which would you want to buy  ?  
 no  you 'll have to get off at the bank  and take a no  .  50  .  
 how many stops are there  ?  
 oh  dear  .  it wo n't get there for new year 's day if i send it by surface mail  .  how much will it cost if i send it by air  ?  
 well  it has a cassette record  .  .  .  a cassette tape  .  
 yes  i 'd like to insure it for 20 dollars  .  how much shall i pay altogether  ?  
 of course  .  here you are  .  
 no  it 's the number fiftyeight  .  
 yes  they all stop at this corner  .  
 i like it very much  but it 's a little confusing to me  .  
 you 'll soon get accustomed to it  .  it 's not difficult  .  well  here 's the bus  .  fortunately  it 's not full  .  
 that does n't sound too bad  .  
 must i catch a number 7 bus to get there  ?  
 i am not cheating  .  when you pass go  you collect  200  everyone knows that  !  
 here 's the same pan  but it has a spaceage  heatresistant plastic handle  .  
 oh  my family 's going to love this one  .  i 'll take it  .  
 what budget  ?  
 why only  300  ?  
 okay  i  ve decided  .  i  m going to pop the question  !  
 fabulous  !  we should look at engagement rings then  !  now that  s a whole other section  .  
 sure you can  .  but i 'm only gonna keep it for a month  .  
 you 're going to resell it on ebay taiwan  ?  
 oh  .  .  .  around twenty bucks  .  a bargain if you ask me  .  look at the picture of her playing with it  !  
 and i recently bought an americanstyle washer and dryer  .  come and see  .  
 and the stove is brand new  .  you know how to use a gas stove  right  ?  
 and we could get a dog  !  
 well  you do that when your nose needs blowing  .  i was talking about a way to make your throat heal faster  .  
 ca n't we go to mcdonald 's first  ?  
 this is all your medicine  .  you need to take it four times a day for three days straight  .  
 and the downstairs neighbors  ?  
 no  i 'm fine  .  i do n't need to see a doctor  .  
 ok  .  i 'll go see the doctor  .  
 aw  momyou 're such a drag  .  
 you say that now  lily  but you 'll thank me later  .  i 'm your mom  and mother knows best  .  
 and when we get back from the doctor 's  you 'll gargle again  .  
 well  the only free food on the streets is from a soup kitchen  and their soup is n't as tasty as mine  !  
 i know  grandma  i just  .  .  .  
 yes 'm  .  
 what time is it anyway  ?  
 ninethirty  .  
 if you take out the garbage and do the dishes  i 'll think about it  .  
 well  indian cuisine actually doesn t serve beef  .  you see  cows are a sacred animal  a very important element in the hindu religion  so beef is not eaten  .  
 what about veggies  ?  
 they have a good variety of vegetablebased dishes like talak panter  vegetable samosas or daal  .  
 helen  this is not like your own bathroom  .  just leave it to the cleaners  okay  ?  
 that 's right  .  not all states have an income tax  .  some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead  .  
 i see  .  all right  well i think everything else i can figure out on my own  .  the deductions for health insurance and my 401  k  are pretty selfexplanatory  .  thanks for your help  susan  .  
 yes  i would like the chicken cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole  .  
 wow  !  that 's interesting  !  it must be tough  !  
 ninety dollars is pretty steep  .  i 'll take it for sixty bucks  .  
 eightyfive  ?  that 's the best you can do  ?  i 'll come back later  .  .  .  
 and steve is going to look after you until we come back  .  
 really  ?  it almost looks brand new  .  and the color designs are so retro  .  
 this is one of my favorite items  .  
 oh  why not  ?  i 'll take em  .  
 i 'll take one right now for seven dollars  .  
 it 's not only about getting fat or not  it 's about being healthy  .  you could really have some health problems later on  .  
 got it  .  
 well ok  i am just afraid of getting food poisoning  .  
 good idea  !  
 like what  ?  i think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction  .  
 here you go  .  
 we apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this  .  if your flight is urgent  i can put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening  but it 's on a first come first served basis  so there is no guarantee that you will be able to take that flight  .  
 this is the only way to get at the problem  .  anyway  if you want to relieve the pain  you are just going to have to be tough and do it  .  
 ok  do you know what kind of food will be served  ?  
 that 's another varietal  or type of grape  just like chardonnay  .  
 that does n't really sound like something i would be interested in  .  in any case  i just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day  .  
 f  .  y  .  i  .   there is a flea market nearby  but maybe you 're done  .  .  .  
 that was a thirtieth birthday present  .  you can have it if you want  .  
 well  this home is too big for me now  so i 'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller  .  therefore  i need to part with a few things  .  
 can i get a relaxer  too  ?  and why did you say   you crazy  instead of  you ou 're crazy   ?  
 how you feeling   vista  ?  mind if i take your friend round the dance floor  ?  
 ok  right this way  .  what color did you have in mind  ?  
 hmmm . not good  .  they  re too tight . the length is right  but the shoe is too narrow and it  s pinching my toes  .  and there  d be no room for my insoles  .  you know what  ?  i don  t think i have the patience for this today  .  they just don  t make shoes like they used to  .  i  ll come back another time  .  
 how much are you selling it for  ?  
 what are you buying  ?  
 get some snack foods  .  
 what 's the problem  ?  
 how does this afternoon at 2 thirty sound to you  ?  
 alright  so i 'll see you then  ?  
 let  s start with the basics  bread  .  bread is an important ingredient here  .  you need to remember one thing  choose the bread according to the following criteria  freshness  crumb and color  .  if you want a closed sandwich i recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven  or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color  .  
 here you are sir  .  your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot  .  remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train  !

 we can do that  .  it 'll just cost you extra  .

 some new clothes  .  how about you  ?  
 haha  i could never do that  .  i  d be a zombie if i didn  t have my morning coffee fix  .  let  s get down to business then  .  
 yes  .  i  ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone  .  the demand for phone cameras is growing  and pear has been falling behind in the market  .  
 i hope you can make the new cards just like my old cards  .

 well  they took us along with some paramedics  .  there was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures  .  his wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital  .  it was intense  !  
 what  ?  you call that a stir fry  ?  more meat than vegetables  ?  that  s the worst insult you could throw at a chinese stir fry  .  what a disgrace to the wok she fried it in  !  what you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap  !  
 okay  .  do you have a particular size in mind  ?  
 look at this one  .  it 's our biggest pan  .  
 yes  that is big enough  but it 's too heavy for me  .

 yes  here you are  .  
 oh  of course  .  how silly of me to forget  .  
 i really like this one  .

 oh  i 'm sorry to bother you  .  
 who would you like to talk to  ?

 that  s  1825  .  
 right  .  
 all right  those sound good  .  i  ll take it  .  
 oh  hi  mary  what can i do for you  ?  
 you could save a couple of dollars by taking it to the dump yourself  though  .  
 oh  o  .  k  .  where  s that  ?  
 can i help you  ?  
 thanks  i appreciated it  .  
 it 's clogged and water wo n't go down  .  
 well  i  m going to move out anyway  .  the new apartment has central airconditioning  .  
 well  i had to wait until the lease expired  .  so  .  .  .  
 i wish i could  but i  ve got to go now  .  i have an appointment in 20 minutes  .  
 oh  it runs every 20 mins  .  you must have missed it  when you came here  .  it should be here any minute now  .  
 thank you  !  
 ok  let 's do that  even though we may have to take a longer way  .  
 no problem  madam  .  should i check the air in the spare tyre as well  ?  
 30 dollars and 10 cents  ?  here you go  .  
 sure  .  will you be long  ?  
 well  we could eat in more  .  that 300 dollars for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants  .  
 come on  .  if we save more money  we can retire earlier and you  ll actually have time to read all those books you buy  .  
 ok  .  let 's compromise  .  if you agree to only spend 75 on books  i 'll agree to only spend 40 for my next shirt  .  
 let 's see  .  we spent 700 dollars for our home loan payment  400 on groceries  75 on utilities  250 on gasoline  100 on books and 300 on entertainment last month  .  
 i just put it on the chair a while ago  but now it 's gone  .  
 it is  .  you must be new here  .  i do my shopping here regularly  once a week  .  
 ok  thank you  .  
 you are welcome  !  
 your bac exceeds legal limit  .  
 well  i wanna buy some new perfume  .  
 i shall not keep you long then  .  it was about some saucepans you had in your window last week  .  
 oh  they were lovely  .  sort of imitation wood  dark brown color  countrystyle you know  and the lids  if i remember rightly  they had a sort of leaf pattern  or was it flowers  ?  
 that 's strange  .  i do n't recognize any of the ones we had from that description  .  are you sure they were in this shop  ?  
 oh  you must know the ones i mean  .  they were on sale  a real bargain  .  reduced to a quarter of the original price  .  i could n't believe my eyes when i saw them  .  
 yes  yes  i am sorry i wo n't keep you  .  it must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time  .  but they were such beautiful saucepans  .  i  d have bought them if i had made up my mind on the spot  .  
 could you run over to the store  ?  we need a few things  .  
 okay  .  how much  ?  
 no  .  i think a half gallon will be enough  .  
 do you have enough money  ?  
 oh  .  in that case  i 'll pay cash  .  
 this is bob  .  where have you been  mary  ?  i have been trying to get on to you for the last half hour  .  don  t you leave your home at 7 
 i will tell you tomorrow  .  see you tomorrow  mary  .  
 see you tomorrow  .  
 it 's my pleasure  .  see you  .  
 yes  i  ll have the texas chili burger  .  
 i do n't want to do that to you  karen  .  
 well  you can  t give her granny panties . have you thought about getting her somesleepwear  ?  we  ve got these lovely  silky nighties  .  or  how about a nice pantyand andbra set  .  look  here  s a nice satin pushup bra  and you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it  .  
 i see  .  what else  ?  
 well  standard mail can take up to fifteen working days  .  priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days  .  express is the fastest  but it  s also the most expensive  .  it only takes three days and you can track your package online  .  
 he bought me an iron  .  
 i  ll be happy to get him something special  even if it coasts a little extra  .  
 oops  !  
 well  .  tea represents another facet of popular culture  .  while a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft  elegant music  a teahouse is often a noisy  crowded  public space  .  people visit tea 
 well  he should n't be long  .  he said he was just going to get some paint  .  but i would n't be surprised if he 's stopped off at the pub on the way back  .  
 sure  here you are  .  
 yeah  i guess that 's a typical example of when in rome  do as the romans do  .  
 looks like you 'll have to get a place in the suburbs  .  
 i 'm sorry  .  i do n't know  .  
 brown  please  .  
 no way  gordon  .  i know that you are a little short on cash at the moment  .  there 's no need for you to pay for the whole bill  .  
 bye  .  
 that 's nice  .  do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price  ?  
 yes  .  it was starving and looking for something to eat when i saw it  .  
 make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions  .  
 yes  .  
 i promise i 'll pay you back as soon as we get home  .  
 sure  but i do n't drink much  .  so i do n't know what to order  .  
 here you are  .  
 here we go  .  
 must i catch a number 7 bus to get there  ?  
 look at my cell phone  .  i can listen to music  watch movies  take pictures  play games  surf the web and download documents  .  it 's just like a pad  .  
 that 's cool  .  i can use the computer and the internet pretty well  but i 'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products  .  
 hang on  .  are you sure you want to keep a nontraditional pet  ?  
 i do n't believe it 's a good choice to keep those pets  especially for families with young children  .  
 oh  i should have thought of my brother 's baby girl  .  maybe i 'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet  .  
 yes  good luck  maria  .  
 you 'll cook it of course  !  
 i 've never tried eshopping  .  is it better than shopping at an actual store  ?  
 oh john  i thought we said we would start eating right  !  remember  ?  our new healthy lifestyle  ?  that  s all junk food  !  
 humph  !  right  so what did you get  ?  
 i like doughnuts  .  
 i think he 'll be back in about an hour at least  .  
 fine  !  i am going to go home and drop off this nightstand  coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things  .  
 while you are at it can you pick out a nice recliner  ?  i really want one so i can watch tv  .  
 sure that sounds great  !  are there any other fees  ?  
 not at all  .  no hidden fees or surcharges  it is a flat monthly rate  .  
 yes of course  .  we can activate all these services in about an hour  .  
 ok  sir  it sounds like you might have a virus  .  
 you can buy a money order and mail mature immigration  .  
 that 's a little bit expensive  .  
 did n't you even want to go to the cinema  ?  
 not really  .  i watched television for an hour  .  
 i went to a boxing match in the sports stadium  .  
 all right  .  i 'll come  .  but i 'd like to bring a present something for your new house . what would you like  ?  
 nothing  .  i mean  do n't bring anything  .  it is n't necessary  .  
 but i 'd still like  .  .  .  
 oh  sorry mom  i forgot . please give me a glass of orange juice  .  
 amy  you forgot another magic word  .  
 perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch  .  they don  t do much else in their free time  .  at least they always do their homework first  .  
 if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch  remember to have something else for them to do  .  if you don  t  they  ll get bored and misbehave  .  
 that sounds very good  .  which website should i visit to download it  ?  
 very well sir  .  would you like to have some shirts made also  ?  
 yes  .  i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company  .  it can be frustrating when the connection is poor  .  
 this cafe offers a wireless internet connection  .  that means i can get on the net for free while i  m here  .  of course  i have to buy a cup of coffee  !  
 so  are you going to quit driving to work then  ?  
 no  !  five minutes i promise  !  
 does this fashion really fit my figure  ?  
 the total is 90 dollars including tax  .  
 debit card  .  
 so you are saying that i should eat  but i should just watch what i eat  ?  
 and even if it takes two hours  huh  ?  
 hey  listen  .  i had every right to stay in the lane i was in . you were supposed to wait until i passed to pull out . and anyhow  you did n't give me any time to change lanes . all of a suddenbangthere you are right in front of me  .  
 to hell with you  .  the accident was your fault  .  
 i do n't know  .  i want my clothes to be clean  .  
 yes  .  
 thanks  .  my name 's nick  .  
 you know what  i have to pick something up at the mall  so why don  t you clean the floors and i 'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries  .  
 sure that  s fine  .  here is the list of all the things you need to get  .  do n't forget anything  !  and can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home  ?  
 come on  son  you  re looking at this too naively  the chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability  and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point  .  
 no  i guess not  .  but that 's what i want  is n't it  ?  an efficiency  .  
 that sounds alright  .  
 got it . let s call these two and see if we can make appointments to see the apartments  .  
 yes  twice now  .  i think it 's too hightech  and so it 's the first part that breaks  .  
 well  .  no  i did n't clean it . but still  i only had the last one two months  and it broke  .  i do n't trust autoreverse  .  
 this one sells for  39 . 99  .  
 thanks  .  
 the shoulder  .  
 no  forget that  !  do the tourniquet first  .  i 'm losing too much blood  .  
 well  do you have any for tomorrow  ?  
 no can do  .  .  .  sorry  .  
 perfect  .  thank you  .  bye  .  .  
 wait  !   !  i need your address  !  
 oh  is that so  ?  well  then  .  let me show you something she might like  .  it 's on our back lot  .  
 it 's because our prices are so good . and this car has a lot of miles on it  .  but it 's in nice shape  is n't it  ?  
 it really hurts  .  
 well  i guess i will have to drive back down then  .  hmm  .  i did n't think of that  .  
 just a moment  sir  .  we have to finish filling out the forms  .  
 i wanted to show you the cabin  .  we only had another halfhour to go  .  
 okay  i 'll follow your advice  .  
 we have this beautiful platinum pendant  or you could also get her a locket  .  you could also get her a timepiece  it  s both glamorous yet functional . if you tell me a little more about your girlfriend  maybe i can help you find something for her  .  
 jess  ?  well  she  s very smart  and has a great sense of humor  .  she  s very feminine  .  .  .  
 perhaps you could give her a ring  ?  
 fabulous  !  we should look at engagement rings then  !  now that  s a whole other section  .  
 no  i did n't save this time . damn it  !  and i 'm sick of writing this paper  .  now i have to write it all over again too  .  
 it does n't matter  .  i still can go out and buy a beer  .  
 yes  that 's true  .  damn  !  i just lost half my paper  and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen  .  
 it will be a piece of cake  .  
 sorry  i wo n't  .  i 'll be working against the clock to finish my presentation  .  
 really  ?  even for such an excellent one  ?  
 go to yahoo . com and click on  travel  and  tickets  .   they  ll be about a billion sites to look at  .  
 well  it  s very comfortable just to drift here  .  
 would you mind telling me then  what were those four years of college for  ?  what was the point of all that hard work  ?  
 sorry  .  
 it  s all right  though  .  just get off at the next stop and catch the 79a  .  
 but i  ve gotta have the budge before anything else  .  
 well  you can have it for eleven hundred  as a friend  .  
 victory for me  i bought it for 30 bucks just yesterday  !  
 yes  .  we  re having a special sale on this machine here  .  
 just make sure you never touch the wire  .  
 that  s james  .  
 that  s joanna  .  joanna hopes to go to college  .  
 what for  ?  for the party  of course  .  
 we  re having a valentine  s day party  .  
 can i help you get ready  ?  
 at what address  sir  ?  
 good day  .  i  m looking for a onebedroom apartment today  .  
 the wagon with the water  of course  .  
 not really  but they are on the rise  .  
 i  m moving to a new home  .  
 5557658 
 sorry to hear that  .  can we do anything about it  ?  
 certainly  .  as you can see  we have several threepiece suites on sale  .  feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are  .  
 i 'm afraid we 'll be late for the party  .  
 but you bought it only last month  .  
 thank you for calling  .  
 you must have dialed the wrong number  .  
 what 's the matter  ?  it does n't taste good  ?  
 well  i think you are very good at doing the dishes  so maybe you should do them for another week  .  
 i 'm not an expert  but that 's the impression i have  .  
 we just moved in yesterday  actually  .  
 sounds fascinating  .  where is your new house located  ?  
 i 'd be up for that  !  
 he says he 's just arrived in scotland  .  he says he 's staying at a youth hostel  .  you know he 's a member of the y  .  h  .  a  .  
 what 's that  ?  
 most people eat tempura with chopsticks  but you can use a fork if you do n't know how to use chopsticks  .  
 i used to buy lunch every day from the international food stall at school  .  every day was an adventure  !  
 will you make some recommendation  ?  
 well  i feel a little tired  .  
 sure  what would you like  ?  
 i really did  but what  s so great about it is that it  s really affordable  .  
 the rent is  725 each month  .  
 yes  it is  .  thank you very much  .  
 the owners might not be aware of everything wrong with the house  .  some things are hidden  but might still be a problem for you in the future  .  
 the carpet needs to be cleaned  and i want to paint the walls a different color  .  
 my grandmother needs me to help her trim her roses that day  .  
 yes  it 's still vacant  .  are you interested in seeing it  ?  
 i 'll be bringing an application form  .  
 did you find a lot of things wrong during the home inspection  ?  
 i 'm interested in the apartment on main street  .  
 yes  i would very much like to see it  .  
 okay  i 'll see you at 6 o 'clock  .  do you need any directions  ?  
 actually  it was just some leftovers from yesterday  .  i made far too much food to eat alone  .  i am glad you could come over to help me finish it  .  
 that wardrobe looks quite big  .  is it full of clothes  ?  
 ok  .  i  ll let you know when i  ve sorted out my clothes  .  
 so  let  s see  .  you have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls  .  you  ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries  .  the bath  shower and waterbasin are the sam 
 how long did it take you to do the tiling  .  
 as i hadn  t done it before  i had to keep referring to information i got from the internet  .  doing the floor tiles took a whole dayfrom early morning to right through to the evening  .  the 
 yes  .  i  ve heard that people in your country like to eat lamb chops  .  
 well  i  ve bought a lot of meat  .  i  ve got pork chops  small steaks  chicken wings and plenty of hot dog sausages and hamburger patties  .  
 i hope you haven  t invited any vegetarians  .  
 what  s wrong with it  ?  
 yes  we don  t want everyone to burn their mouths and have a drink gallons . of water . ok  i  m really to do the meat . should i cook it over a low flame  ?  
 you don  t have to eat them  .  i don  t mind  .  
 i have apple pie  ice cream  chocolate cake and fruit cocktail  .  
 sure . can you get it yourself  it  s in the refrigerator  .  
 that is too expensive  .  
 would you please reconsider  ?  
 i can afford about  800 a month for rent  .  
 i can let it go at  900 a month  .  
 what do landlords charge for rent  ?  
 you will have to pay  1050 every month  .  
 i was thinking  800 a month  .  
 oh  i nearly forgot the exams  .  
 how much are you asking for every month  ?  
 no  i 'd like to do something special for you on your birthday  .  
 ok . now how can i help  hon  ?  
 hmm  let me see  .  boil some water  and then whisk two eggs  .  
 oh  really  ?  where  d you find it  ?  
 what is the rent each month  ?  
 very well  thank you  .  
 can you bring me a glass of orange juice  please  ?  i am quite thirsty  .  
 just buy a cask of wine  .  have you bought ice yet  ?  
 not today  thanks  .  but i 'd like to know any of the vegetarian dishes  .  
 what kind of soup would you like  ?  
 yes  .  
 i 'm ask for a pizza  please  .  
 medium one will be perfect  thank you 
 i like seafood on my pizza  .  
 tuna sounds good today  .

 i 'd like the double cheese burger meal  please  .  
 what nationality are you  ?  
 i  m a keyboard operator  .  what  s your job  ?  
 thank you  mr  .  jackson  .  
 which glasses  ?  these glasses  .  
 yes  please  .  
 don  t do that  .  give it to me  .  
 what are you going to do with it  ?  
 be careful  .  don  t drop it  !  don  t put it there  sam  .  put it here  on this shelf  .  
 i  m fine  thanks  .  how is tony  ?  
 yes  please  .  
 like what  ?  
 what about  ?  
 i would keep it because you would be breaking our contract  .  
 if you break the contract  then you will not receive your deductible  .  
 how much do you think the rent will be  ?  
 i guess i might take a look at it  .  
 yes  everything has been well designed  .  
 ooh  that 's my favorite  .  maybe i 'll have a small slice  .  
 skim  please  .  that 'd be very nice  .  thanks  .  .  .  oh no  .  janna  i 'm so sorry  but i 've got to go  .  
 i just got a message from my sister saying that she 's been in a car accident  .  i need to go pick her up  .  
 actually  i 've only got a twoseater  .  i 'll have to go on my own  .  
 well  i wanted to get a pet that would n't disturb the neighbors  .  at the same time  i wanted a pet that would be affectionate  .  
 no  rabbits are n't very stinky  .  as long as your clean the cage on a regular basis  it 's not too bad  .  
 oh  no  !  i thought it seemed a bit strange  .  
 no  some people have macs now  too  .  
 you should probably call the it department and have them check your computer for virus  .  
 it 's hard to say  .  while dogs are more affectionate  cats are much easier to take care of  .  
 when i was little  we had a few domestic dogs at home  .  
 do you want to try some of my yogurt  .  it 's a favorite everyday dessert in greece  .  
 sure  .  i 'll just have a bite  .  
 what do you think  ?  does it taste good  ?  
 cruise control  ?  i do n't like that  .  
 you know  sir  you do n't have to use it . you can turn it on or off  .  if you do n't want to use it  you just never turn it on  .  
 sure i would  .  
 the better you sand it  the better the finish will be  .  
 alright  .  
 sawdust  ?  
 yes  sawdust is the tiny particles of wood . you could call it wood dust  .  you must wipe it off . the wood should be very clean before you put the varnish on  .  
 and then  ?  
 it all sounds very complicated  .  
 the color i use now is rose . how much does this rose foundation cost  ?  the 100ml bottle  .  
 of course  .  here is our thickening mascara . we also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes  .  
 are you kidding  ?  that 's the stupidest gift one can buy  .  i do n't want to get a tie  .  
 how much do you want to spend  ?  
 alright  .  we can go later then  .  
 she said she wants one of those automatic foot massagers  .  i think they sell them at sears  .  
 no  .  i only want it to be a very good one  .  the best . it s a graduation gift for my son  .  
 yes  he sure does . in fact  he wants to become a movie producer himself . he wants to study film at the university  .  
 what 's that  ?  
 thanks  .  
 what  s she doing  ?  
 here you are  .  
 where  s the tea  ?  
 there are some in the cupboard  .  can you find them  ?  
 they are very uncomfortable  .  but women always wear uncomfortable shoes  !  
 what about vegetables  ?  
 well  i have n't got much either  !  
 beef  please  .  
 this lamb 's very good  .  
 because i have just retired  .  i want to buy a small house in the country  .  
 do n't you think it  s a bit bright  ?  
 that dress looks lovely on you  but it  s not very practical  is it  ?  
 ok  .  what do you think about our living room  ?  
 my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift  .  
 how much are you looking to spend  ?  
 do you know of anyone who needs a roommate  ?  
 i can sign a contract up to a year  .  i don  t know where i  ll be after that  .  
 i 'm really sorry  ethan  .  i tried so hard  but i 'm afraid i could't find a dutch restaurant in town  .  the best i could do was a german one about 15 minutes from here  .

 which university should i apply to  ?  
 more than one  .  i think the count is now three  if i remember correctly  .  
 i think i 'm going to decline  .  i just prefer to do my own thing  .  
 have you even thought that far ahead  ?  i mean what country would you like to do business with  ?  
 it beats me  !  i never thought about it before and maybe i thought finding a career is a simple thing  .  
 ok  .  here you are  .  
 of course  as long as the card is well kept  .  
 have fun  .  
 you are so kind  .  thank you very much  .  
 you  d better hurry  !  
 i will  .  
 it 's the end of the world for me  .  
 b  i 'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me  .  
 do n't lose heart  .  everything will be fine  .  
 it 's true  sir  .  
 what about water pollution instead of pollution  ?  
 i suggest you take this book  .  it 's very exciting  .  
 my paper is on the influence of television on children  .  
 sure  no problem  .  asking for leave again  ?  you have been absent from class five times this semester  .  
 i agree that miss li does n't teach so well  .  most students either sleep or do other things in her class  .  
 you can count on me  .  
 thanks  .  
 yes  it is  .  
 oh  the final exam is coming soon  .  i feel a little bit nervous  .  
 yes  i 'd like to know how to use the library  .  you know  i 'm a new student here  .  
 that 's all you need  .  
 for two weeks  .  after that you must renew the book if you wish to keep them longer  .  
 maybe another time  .  people say that boys dormitories are in a mess  is it true  ?  
 oh my god  do n't you know that such living environment is not healthy  ?  
 what 's to come next  ?  
 from 3 to 6 months if everything goes well  .  
 how about tomorrow  ?  
 ok  .  
 yes  it  s exciting  .  this month we are doing crossword puzzles  .  
 why did n't you tell me  ?  i did n't know you were one of our students  .  
 oh  i did n't know that  .  
 actually  i recommend you take shakespeare sooner rather than later  .  
 is that right  ?  
 well  i hope you let me hang out with you then  .  maybe i can learn from you  .  
 thanks  .  i really appreciate it . in fact  i do need a letter of recommendation for this scholarship  .  
 what kind of scholarship is it  ?  
 i  m sorry  .  it  s for reference only  so it must stay in the library  .  but you  re welcome to look through it  .  
 ok  .  and i  d like to check these books out  .  
 it takes a long time to learn chinese writing  .  
 i like it so far  .  but my english still needs work  .  
 you mean you and i  ?  
 sure  .  i 'll give you mine too  .  then we can call if we have to cancel for some reason  .  
 why  ?  just read your notes . you can see what the professor stressed in the lectures . probably the exam will ask about things he stressed  .  
 my name is derek schneider  s  c  h  n  e  i  d  e  r  .  
 yes  here it is . alright  .  then i just need your completed application form  and i will be able to process your request  .  
 since you 're chinese  maybe you can find parttime work in chinatown  .  
 well  why do n't you go and look down there  ?  
 it may be parttime work as a waitress or something . it would be illegal  but sometimes waitresses make a good salary  .  
 well  .  .  .  alright  .  i guess i have a minute  .  
 what about beer  ?  
 the card does n't actually give you discounts on beer . but it will give you discounts on certain club cover charges . so if you want to see your favorite band at amy 's or cosmo 's club  you get a discount on the entrance fee  .  
 why  ?  
 good for you  .  
 she did last time  .  
 if you give me your address  i can mail you an information packet and the application forms  .  
 you and everyone else  .  it looks more like a campground than a library  .  
 i am  but there is too much material to cover  .  i  ll be writing forever  and grant only wants five to seven pages  .  
 closed  ?  the clerk told me i could come back and register any time during the first week of classes  .  
 she must have been a parttime worker  .  they didn  t have much training  .  why didn  t you register then  ?  
 yes  sir  .  
 i 'd like to introduce myself first  .  
 it 's my pleasure to talk with you  .  
 i do n't know  .  
 so i take it you are not interested  .  
 by bus  of course  .  
 he is a lawyer  .  
 ok  see you then  .  
 how are they proportioned  ?  
 what does mph stand for  ?  
 no  the other three girls major in a computer science  and they can help me a lot with the computer operating  .  
 that 's great  !  
 oh  i thought i did a good job  .  
 i hear you have to wear uniforms at private school  .  
 yes  .  i 'm just waiting until i officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa  .  
 ok  .  well  go to www . google . com  and type in normandy landing  .  
 thanks  .  
 for detailed information  however  you should read a history book  .  
 i hear we  ll have a new english teacher this semester  .  
 well  i am certainly going to take chemistry and physics  but i have n't decided on the other subjects yet  .  i 'd like to take english  .  
 study english  .  
 really  ?  that  s marvelous  !  
 and then you  re old man won  t be beaten this time  .  
 thanks  june  .  but i think i need to be certified as a mechanic 5 before i  m allowed to repair cars for a living  .  
 that  s not a big problem  .  there are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified  .  
 yup  you understand  .  and my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a catholic college  .  they both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline  .  and the tuition is usually pretty low  .  
 in my opinion  you  ll make it  .  
 i am afraid so  .  i am terribly sorry  !  
 any terrible fines  ?  
 really  ?  do you think english is that important  ?  
 no  i left it at home . sorry  !  
 it was always very busy there  .  
 fill in the slip  then take it to the circulation desk  .  they will get you what you want  .  
 what a pity  !  i missed it again  .  
 fill out this form and we will send you a note when we get the book  .  
 a b plus  .  
 thanks  .  but i really do n't feel like watching movies tonight  .  i have to get an early start in the morning  .  
 yes  of course  .  
 sorry  this biography is over the deadline  .  you should pay extra for it  .  
 you are welcome  .  see you next time  .  
 that 's only a joke  .  to be honest  i have to improve my english  because my english is not good enough  .  i still get confused about some simple grammars  .  since you are quite good at it  do you have any suggestions  ?  
 are there any clear answers in the book to this question  ?  
 oh  there is n't such a code called economic law  .  the economic law of china is a general concept for several laws  .  
 there is n't such a code  ?  
 yes  it 's a general name for several laws related to economics  like commercial law  and law of central bank  .  
 oh  god  i 've forgotten it  .  
 really  ?  is there a foreign teacher for every class  ?  
 it depends  .  if they are not busy  they will come to join us  and talk with us  .  
 what do you think of the literature course  .  
 and how long does the course last  ?  
 yes  that 's all right  .  i want to enroll in the course  .  
 yeah  .  the test was fairly easy and almost every testtaker could pass that exam  .  adult college entrance exam is much easier than college entrance exam  .  and there are fewer subjects  .  
 well  if you think you are ready  i 'll let you enroll  .  
 there are hundreds and hundreds . english is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions  .  
 i 'll look up the rate . to look up does n't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . it means to search for and find some information  .  
 what are you majoring in  ?  
 do you know anything about britain and america  ?  
 well  i have to take biology  chemistry  maps and physics . what you need is a good introductory course for nonscience majors  .  
 i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly  ?  
 sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them  .  
 yes  .  she teaches our class three times a week  .  
 yes  here it is  .  
 okay  thank you  .  
 yeah  how about your maths teacher  ?  
 i 'm sorry to hear that  .  
 professor wood  ?  i think he 's a brilliant scientist  .  
 you 're right  .  if i were the teacher  i would n't have done that  .  
 i am going to be a  well  i hope to be a research chemist  .  
 what is it  ?  
 do n't mention it  .  
 we need to set the table for four  .  
 that 's right  .  mom did n't know where to buy chopsticks for you  .  
 you 've got to be joking  !  it 's the teacher 's right to say anything wants  and if she saw myra cheating  she certainly had the right to say so  .  
 tom  your task is to clean the blackboard  .  
 i 'm going to sweep the floor first  .  
 ok  i 've finished cleaning the blackboard  .  
 oh  i forgot about it  .  i 'll get it  .  
 i will be done before they come  .  
 surprise  ?  
 of course  i 'd like to  .  
 what is in it  ?  
 of course  .  they are very friendly  .  
 yes  that 's a good idea  .  
 let 's give them a hand  .  
 english school  ?  what is that  ?  
 is that different from our school 's english course  ?  
 what 's the tallest building  ?  
 yes  .  
 what 's the building to the south of the library  ?  
 yes  .  there is a large swimming pool  but it is only available in summer  .  
 i do envy you  .  and i hope i can enter your school one day  .  
 wonderful  bruce is taking the lead  .  
 other competitors have almost caught up with him  .  they are neck and neck  .  
 thanks  .  
 how much does it cost  ?  
 at five  .  
 do boys and girls go to school together  ?  
 do you think this is a good idea  ?  
 all you need is your student identification card to check out books  .  
 how long can i keep the books  ?  
 i want a book on physics  .  could you show me where i can find it  ?  
 just a second  .  i 'll see if i can find them for you  .  
 is she your teacher  ?  
 yes . she teaches our class three times a week  .  
 well  yes  .  i do n't mind admitting that i am  .  i enjoyed school  but i did object to having to go in every day once we 've done all our exams  .  
 that 's too much for us really  .  
 when do you start school  ?  
 are there any psychology classes available  ?  
 can you tell me about the other class  ?  
 you 're positive that these are the only classes left  ?  
 that 's a good idea  .  you are really creative  .  
 what do you need  ?  
 it 's room number 261  .  
 what a great idea  !  now you have a friendly audience to practice with  !  
 that 's right  .  and it 's a b that i 'll be writing too  .  her name is olga  .  
 i  m not kidding  .  learning a language is a question of forming language habits and that takes time  .  
 no  .  you just have to stay here long enough to get some orientation  .  then you go on practicing and learning outside  .  a lot of learning depends on your personal motivation  .  
 sure  .  once you get the hang of it  it  s a piece of cake  !  it  s nothing to worry about  .  
 a reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge  .  don  t you think so  ?  
 i think i see what you mean  .  i can read shakespeare but i definitely can  t write it  .  
 oh  poor you  .  you know what  ?  i found a new way to learn chinese and it works very well  .  
 you can say that  .  i can actually sing some of them now  .  
 why not  ?  i downloaded a beautiful song the other day  .  we can learn it together now  .  
 yes  just in case we run into me new characters  .  
 well  i had a meeting today with a woman from japan and she would n't stop bowing  !  i did n't know what to do  !  
 i think it 's highly possible  yes  .  
 for more than five years  .  
 that makes you feel uncomfortable  ?  
 yeah  .  we never do that in a public office  .  
 i have felt that  .  one day when i was in a queue  reading a newspaper story  the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper i was holding  .  
 oh  i 'm shocked  .  
 yeah  i think the food is alright  it 's not too spicy though it 's a little salty for me  .  but you are chinese  you should have known better  .  
 nice to meet you  lvan . my name is alike  .  i 'm from japan  .  
 it must be interesting to study english  .  
 mario and i are the best students in the class  .  miss parker says that my pronunciation is very good  .  
 sometimes it 's difficult  .  some words look different from the way one pronounces them  .  
 but  you were born and raised in california  !  
 i told him 28 years  .  and  he knows i 'm 28 years old since i just celebrated my birthday last week  .  he was puzzled for a minute  and then he got it  .  
 he said  36 years  and we both laughed about it  .  he apologized and now  it 's all good  .  
 after being raised together  men and women can be businesslike in each other  s company  .  it really doesn  t have anything to do with the way a man and woman behave toward each other when they are in love  .  does that answer your question  ?  
 study english  .  
 you think  ?  
 actually  i am learning that now  .  but it 's too hard for me  .  you know the four tones and the stuff  .  it really freaks me out  .  
 ok  cool  .  
 is it difficult to learn  ?  
 this is interesting  ms . parker  .  
 you 're catching on  !  however  there are elective courses like wood shop  metal shop  home economics  .  .  .  
 do you know what the room number is  ?  
 it 's c261  .  
 fine  .  once you have it  you can go to the bookstore  .  do you know where that is  ?  
 ok  so once you pass the gym  it 's the first door on your left  .  do you know you can also sell your used textbooks there  ?  
 well  if you decide to go  i could meet you over there at 1 
 oh  okay  .  well  here you go  .  
 oh  wait  here are the rest  .  
 we will return 6 days later on december 8th  .  will someone be picking you up  ?  
 yes  someone is coming to get me  .  
 yes  i 'm hungry  .  what types of food sound good  ?  
 it 's right past that last building on the left  .  do you want me to go with you  ?  
 when you pass the gym  it 'll be the first door on the left  .  do you know how to sell your old textbooks for money  ?  
 i think maybe i could be there  .  
 i hope it works  !  
 it 's on the west side of the campus  .  
 i went up there early this morning  .  
 yes  right  .  
 yeah  the new ones can be tricky  .  what are you trying to buy  ?  
 you 'll find the parking structure on the west side of the campus  .  
 is it full  ?  
 anything else  ?  
 thank you  .  good night  .  
 that  ll be all  .  
 i want to check these books out  .  
 yes  .  that  s it  .  
 these are due back in two weeks  .  
 it  s our policy  .  
 what can i check out  ?  
 may i see your library card  ?  
 i was unable to make it  .  
 sorry  here you go  .  
 i had to watch a football game instead  .  
 fine  but it cannot happen again if you want an  a  in the class  .  
 what i really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher  .  do you enjoy that in a teacher  ?  
 yes  i had a teacher like that before  .  
 well  take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you  .  good luck  !  
 i could meet with you tomorrow anywhere from two until four  what time works out best  ?  
 i am glad that that works out  can you find my office  ?  
 yes  i can  .  
 thank you  i 'll be there  .  
 but could n't you have done it when you felt better  ?  
 ok  go aheadwhat is the excuse this time  ?  
 unfortunately  this is what i have to do  .  
 enjoy your day off and do n't forget to study  !  
 yes  i really need someone who is really good  .  
 two o 'clock would be the best time  .  
 i do n't need to leave until the very end of class  .  
 i have an opening  .  do you have an add sheet for me to sign  ?  
 all of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the hallway  .  see you on monday  !  
 i am not feeling well  .  
 i can stay a few more minutes  .  
 i 'll bring one next time  .  
 across the courtyard on the right is the office  .  follow the signs to the correct line  .  is that clear  ?  
 do you have a car or motorbike  ?  
 i drive a scooter 
 i drive a motorcycle  .  
 if you can remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means that you can only load and unload  you are going to be ok  .  
 i only attend class parttime in the evenings  .  
 i have both  but i usually use my car to get to school  .  
 do you need to buy a duplicate permit for a second vehicle  ?  
 i didn  t see it  .  
 apparently somebody took that book out of the library  .  
 will you ever get another copy  ?  
 we will definitely be getting another  .  
 maybe someone took it  .  
 i  m sure we will  .  
 i  m going to need your library card  .  
 i have it right here  .  
 will you be getting another copy  ?  
 when will my passport be ready  ?  
 did you check the computer  ?  
 i really need to check out this magazine  .  
 then what do i do  ?  
 you owe some money  .  
 you owe  24 . 50  .  
 would you mind showing me how to use it  ?  
 is there a maximum number of copies i can make  ?  
 i will call you when a computer is free  .  
 how do i log on to the computer  ?  
 thanks  .  i  ll be sitting over there  .  
 when there is a computer available  i will call you  .  
 okay  .  thanks for your help  .  
 i would like to use a computer  .  
 do you have your library card  ?  
 yes  .  
 the hours are from 9 am  6 
 i get lost in this library  .  
 thanks a lot for your help  .  
 did you need something  ?

 thank you for all your help  .  
 do i have to pay to use the machine  ?  
 it costs ten cents a copy  .

 what are your hours on saturday  ?  
 i was also accepted into yale university  and sydney university  .  
 that 's excellent  !  have you received your conditional offers yet  ?  
 yes  .  i 'm just waiting until i officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa  .  
 have you ever gone abroad before  ?  
 no  i want to come back to china after i graduate  .  
 i 've received a full scholarship  so i wo n't need any other money to live off while i 'm studying  .  
 you should be  .  you worked really hard last night preparing for it  .  
 you do n't have to thank me  .  it 's just a part of my job as your counsellor  .  
 did you always do well at school  ?  
 i hate school  !  
 who  s the author  ?  
 i like my professors and the classes  but it 's a lot of work  .  
 that sounds really interesting  .  can you speak swahili  ?  
 when did you take your exams  ?  
 rather  .  i 'm afraid i did n't do very well  .  
 that 's because you did well  .  
 no  i would n't worry about you  .  
 yes  but i 'm not sure which one to sign up for  .  
 sure  .  here 's a brochure about out english classes that meet in the evenings  .  
 i 'd like to get a ba  but i do n't know where i should go  .  
 not yet  .  
 what is the purpose of your stay  ?  
 my father has already paid for that in advance  .  here are the receipts  .  
 well  do n't get bend on a ship about it  .  
 oh  my lord  .  i have n't really started them  .  
 kate  you know  i am thinking of getting a parttime job next year because i really need more money and i do n't want to ask my parents for any more  .  but i 'm so busy  !  how am i going to work and study 
 you ca n't do that  jenny  !  
 mary  do n't move  .  stand right there  .  it 's a good shot  .  the background is very pretty  .  
 certainly  .  ok  got you  .  
 do you think it will work  ?  
 it was also a proud day for me  but i also felt like a kind of loss that day  .  
 how could it be  ?  
 i think you lack in the power of decision  .  once you make your decision  do n't be overtaken by misgivings and fear  .  just go full steam ahead  !  
 yeah  you should first decide what kind of career you really want  plan your career path  and then try your best to achieve your goal  .  
 thank you so much for your advice  .  i 'll think it over  .  
 the rapidly expanding economy has encouraged many students to pack their bags amd head for home  .  
 that  s true  .  i  m wondering did you learn anything from the job  ?  
 it must be very demanding  .  
 can you understand your spanish teacher  ?  
 more or less  .  how well do you understand mr  .  wang  your chinese teacher  ?  
 all right  .  
 peter  !  pack them  .  do n't read them  .  
 he does  .  he  s good at this genre too  .  it  s a captivating read  .  
 yes  i would  .  i need to buy a textbook for my course and  as you know  i love browsing through the latest paperbacks  .  
 that  s interesting  .  they must be thinking of moving into that market  .  are there any interesting editorials  ?  
 yes  i do  .  i find it very informative . it always has plenty of articles from correspondents all over the world and the business section is very useful too  .  
 no  not at all  .  
 i didn  t realize it was a romance novel  .  what  s the main storyline  ?  
 won  t they get his inheritance  ?  
 it would take a lot less time  .  .  
 how about this  .  when you finish the book  .  i  ll get the movie and watch it with you  .  
 in this article  scientists say that if you took the genes from someone and tried to create a copy of a person  there  s no guarantee that the copy would look or act like the original  !  
 is that better  ?  
 cool  !  i  ve always wanted to do something like that  !  have you learned anything useful  ?  
 oh yeah  !  almost forgot  !  i need to take fundamental linguistics  consumer psychology and neuroanatomy  .  
 wow  you are going to be busy this semester  !  okay  here you go  .  you are registered now  .  you  ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start  .  
 i liked physics  .  it  s all math  really  .  arcs  curves  velocity  cool stuff  .  
 turtles  ?  whatever  .  .  .  look  all that  s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and antiparticles  .  at least  that  s what the math says  .  
 do we get a day off from school then  ?  
 me  !  me  !  
 madam i  m not trying to kiss you  !  i am trying to demonstrate how to apply cpr in the case of an emergency  .  
 what school would you like to go to  ?  
 pcc is perfectly fine for me  .  
 really  ?  
 that is just an excuse . you can always find some time to exercise  .  
 i know you 're right  but what can i do  ?  
 i feel they 're dirty  .  
 again  !  
 the cause is another boy  .  
 you 're too strict with yourself  .  
 do n't you like to know anything about stocks  ?  
 really  ?  how did you get the chance  ?  
 i  m sure you  ll enjoy the trip  .  china is such a beautiful country  .  
 i  m sure i will  .  
 what 's wrong with it  ?  
 i saw her dating with her exboyfriend again  .  
 think a little  .  i think he means well at the bottom of his heart  .  
 just because he gets on well with everybody  ?  
 listen  nancy  .  if i do n't work hard  i will be laid off  .  
 did she give up her decision to marry dick  ?  
 but joe wo n't you  .  
 she kept on bothering me  .  
 you can say that again  .  
 it 's no use arguing the toss  .  
 but that should not be the reason for you to lose heart  .  
 how could we ever manage to buy a big house when we are always living beyond our means  ?  
 you said it  .  many parents just don  t understand know how to educate their children  .  
 right  .  unless  who know what will happen  .  
 i never trust those stupid doctors  .  
 that 's quite a compliment coming from you  .  
 what  s the matter  ?  what annoy you  ?  
 i am glad we 've straightened everything out  .  
 at school  in china . this is my first time to be out of my own country  .  
 yes  i 'm really excited  .  
 yes  let 's go  .  
 where did you buy it  ?  
 i bought it in a store near my school  .  
 i do n't know  .  i saw him the first time tuesday  .  he was at the cafe  .  i noticed he was looking at me a lot  .  not just the usual looking  but staring . he just kept staring at me  .  he did n't stop  .  
 i did n't do anything  .  finally  he left . but then i saw him again today  .  outside the shoe store  .  near the cafe  .  i went into a cd store and pretended i was looking at cd 's  .  but then he came in too  .  
 did he leave when you left  ?  
 i wonder how much of the city is down  .  
 it 's a boy  .  
 well  you should have thought  .  
 when did you go there  ?  
 i might just do that  .  what style of clothes do they have  ?  
 i was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection  .  
 aw  shucks  ma 'am  .  
 oh  miss anna  !  that 's too hard  !  i wo n't be here long  .  
 oh  that 's all right  .  
 oh  never mind about that  .  
 you 're going to have to put in a lot of hours you know  .  
 i know  .  i 'm a little nervous  but it 's pretty exciting  .  
 nothing particular  .  but   .  .  .  
 thank you for your kindness  .  i will think about it carefully  .  
 it was me  .  i am so sorry  .  
 sorry  .  was i disturbing you  ?  
 yes  it 's most irritating  .  
 i 'm so relieved  .  i just passed the bar exam  .  
 not yet  .  i did n't get a hold of them  .  i 'll try to call them again tonight  .  
 if you 're not busy  do you want to come over  ?  i 'm afraid to be alone  .  
 do n't worry  nothings going to happen  .  i 'll be there real soon  .  
 thank you  but i really want to relax myself  .  i  m very sorry  .  
 ok  .  don  t let it get to you  .  goodbye  .  
 chill out  !  what 's eating you  anyway  ?  
 she 's the teacher 's pet  that 's why  .  besides  he 's so laid back he lets her get away with it  .  she just really rubs me the wrong way  .  and you know what  ?  i think she 's got the hots for him  too  .  
 look  .  i really did n't mean to  and next time i see martha  i 'll really tell her that you and sara are really just friends  .  
 do n't bother  .  
 the bus i took  .  
 it 's not that  .  there 's an animal in my soup  .  
 is there  sir  ?  i 'm very sorry  .  i 'll change it straight away  .  
 i am not in the mood  .  
 i do n't think she would do such a thing  .  
 but she did and it made me disappointed  .  
 yes  it suits you very well  .  it certainly is unique  .  i don  t think i  ve seen anything like it before  .  
 it  s very nice of you to say so  .  i should say you are glamorous yourself  as a matter of fact  .  
 thank you for saying so  .  
 sorry  i 'll bring them to you right away  .  
 i must make an apology for losing my temper  .  
 yes  i do  .  i  ll walk you there  .  
 not yet  .  i have an interview with a visa official today  .  
 that 's right  the brain  !  it serves as a control center for the body  handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition  .  then what major organ is in our chest  ?  
 how about your husband  .  does he help much  ?  
 i see  .  is it your first interview  ?  
 why  ?  
 my acceptance letter to yale  !  
 interesting  .  that  s very different from the chinese education system  .  
 oh  sure  .  in british  students don  t have to take the foundation course  .  
 it 's true  sir  .  
 learning any language takes a lot of effort . but do n't give up  .  why do n't we practise those dialogues together  ?  
 yeah  .  
 no  .  it 's all greek to me  .  
 but let me tell you  you 're doing just fine  .  i could n't do half as well as you do when i was learning german . by the way  how long have you been learning english  ?  
 yes  i am  .  
 don  t get me wrong  .  i like it here  but pcc is better  .  
 no  .  i transferred here from a different school  .  
 well  i wish you luck here  .  
 i think pcc is a lot better than here  .  
 i graduated and now want to get a ba  .  
 i completely agree  .  
 so  have you made your decision yet  ?  
 i  m very nervous  .  
 why are you nervous  ?  
 i really don  t know  .  
 so  why don  t you just stay here  ?  
 as a matter of fact  i am a bit upset  .  i just came out of a meeting and it did n't go very well  .  
 no one would listen to any of my suggestions  .  instead  they just kept arguing with each other  .  
 well  i can tell you from experience that bob might come off a little strong sometimes  .  
 you can always bring up the main points during the meeting and speak to those who are directly involved after the meeting  .  not everyone needs to know all that information  .  
 how dreadful  !  
 look at the view from the window  .  
 she even stayed at a different hotel  .  she said i might be contagious  .  
 i got your email a couple of months back  .  
 right  .  that one  .  did it work  ?  
  .  .  .  and maybe that 's what we both need  .  
 what kind of power struggles are you talking about  ?  
 my coworker had a whole bunch of bad office habits  .  she liked to namedrop  .  .  .  we would be in a meeting and she would say  yesterday i was chatting with tom  .  she meant tom solomon  .  .  .  our ceo  .  
 there 're so many people here  .  where are rich and cath and taylor 's parents  ?  
 i 'm awfully sorry to have kept you waiting for so long  .  
 my watch stopped and i did n't know  .  i certainly need to buy a better one  .  
 i do n't think so actually  .  she never even says  hello  to me  .  
 it 's a little eerie  .  i 'm sure the silence will begin to grow on me  .  
 well  i think it 's fabulous  .  and the neighbors do n't even seem to exist  .  
 i just lost my job  .  my boss just told me  .  
 but he used to be very relaxed and cheerful  .  it 's not like harry to do a thing like that  .  
 i know he really deserves this  .  
 come on  .  give it a chance  .  the movie just started  .  
 here 's the check  .  i included a little extra for you  .  
 personally  i 'm not for it  .  i feel it 's bad for kids to watch  .  
 why not  ?  
 how about the new bar across the road  ?  
 but it was her that makes us so embarrassed  .  
 i know what you mean  .  
 my house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture  .  
 no wonder you look so upset  .  have you called the police  ?  
 i really enjoy the beach in the summer  .  
 i 'd like to come back next weekend  .  
 oh  .  it  s awful  but it can  t be helped  .  
 i don  t think she will do such a thing  .  
 but she means a lot to me  .  
 oh  .  i just can  t forget it  .  
 i really appreciated it  .  
 by the way  would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening  ?  tomorrow is my birthday  .  
 not so soon  .  it  s not my birthday today  .  well  you  ll come  won  t you  ?  
 i  ah  .  .  .   i got have late  .  
 well  i  .  .  .  i lost my wallet  and i  .  .  .  
 are they  ?  
 i see  .  
 i  m very sorry i can  t  .  
 would you like me to give you a lift  ?  
 never mind  .  it  ll be over in 10 minutes  .  
 well  you always say you 're busy  .  
 totally not  .  perhaps it 's about our marriage  .  
 in times of loss  it is often hard to pick up the phone  .  but his whole family was here  .  
 yes  .  .  .  thank you for understanding  .  we have to go now  .  
 i don  t slurp my coffee  .  and plus  how can you hear it when you  re shouting into your phone all the time  ?  
 what do you mean  ?  
 hi honey  !  what  s wrong  ?  why do you have that look on your face  ?  
 john is a peacemaker  .  he simply doesn  t bother  .  he says he should give him a free hand  .  
 you said it  .  many parents just don  t know how to educate their children  .  
 yeah  .  i 'm lucky to be his wife  .  
 i hope so  .  
 i 'm sure you 'll do fine if you try your best  .  
 and my writing is not good  .  i feel so frustrated  .  
 yes  mom  .  you are right  .  nothing is impossible to a willing heart  .  i will keep going  .  
 oh  you want my chocolate cakes  so to speak  !  
 i know  but chocolate cake is even better  .  
 of course  my father used to take me to kiang shan or somewhere like that as a child  .  
 that depends  .  if you are lucky  you can see a vivid rainbow across over two peaks  .  
 to be honest  i like most of them  except for my chinese teacher  .  she is quite young  but her class is too boring  !  
 he is great  .  he always tells us not to study for exams  and to pay more attention to communication rather than just memorizing  .  
 help you in the kitchen  i don  t feel like it  .  
 why didn  t you answer my question  ?  
 maybe it was dick  .  
 me too  .  but i think we can do something else for a change  .  
 you know i work with my professional knowledge not passion  .  sometimes i do n't know what the meaning of working is  ?  
 but you did a good job  .  you always perform the best in our company  .  
 that sounds interesting  .  but i do n't know how to do that  .  
 ok  .  
 sorry  i thought you knew  .  
 what 's the matter  ?  
 this machine is out of order  .  
 i sure did  .  
 you ought to complain  .  these machine are always out of order  .  
 she liked the acting  too  because that 's what she wanted to see  .  
 i was n't happy with it  .  
 what a pity  !  
 and a storm blew our roof away  .  
 elvin does n't want any programming help  .  he wants all the glory for himself  .  
 because  .  .  .  oh  all right  .  you win  .  let  s pay for them and go  .  
 i 'm sorry  .  i forget all about it  .  
 i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed  .  
 if that happen to me  i  ll take them back to the shop  .  
 i did  .  but they said they won  t change them  .  
 but she means a lot to me  .  
 he advised me to change to a more suitable course  .  
 do n't worry about it  .  try to look on the bright sight of things  .  
 criminals are clever  ?  they 're only successful when people are careless  .  
 he did  .  it was one of the best ones available  .  but that did n't stop them from disabling 11 it  .  and on a crowded street too  .  
 yes  all right  .  so why  ?  go on then  .  say it  .  oh  really  mark  .  i promise i 'm not going to be angry  .  now why were you late  ?  
 mam  another minute  could i  ?  
 yes . that would be good  .  
 you should n't have used the machine . did you lose your money  ?  
 say  how would you like to be a dress designer  ?  
 it 's convenient  .  people in network go everywhere by subway if they do n't drive  .  
 i 'm so glad you can finally see things in my way  .  can we leave this dull place now  ?  
 i feel he 's like a talking machine  .  
 i 'm back  .  my bid on the buddha is still the highest  !  
 do n't you want to hear more about my statue  ?  
 but i just got a call from my sister and i have to cancel the movie tonight  .  
 oh  really  ?  thanks a lot  .  .  .  well  i still have a lot to learn  i guess  .  
 what 's wrong  ?  
 i 'm sorry  but i 've got an important job to do  .  
 her father is dying  .  
 that  s a good idea  .  the counselor is a psychologist  .  he  s better trained to handle these sorts of things  .  
 i don  t really like henry  .  i like my rose  .  
 yes  but what  s the banging noise  ?  
 and is she helping him  ?  
 susan  just one last week i went out to have a lunch with her  .  there is nothing for you to be jealous about  .  i like your company much better than janet  s  .  
 about 2 o  clock in the morning  .  
 all right  .  
 surely  i 'll have one made for you  .  you want a print  ?  
 what do you mean  ?  
 i don  t see any problem  only the car is a bit old  .  
 you  ve been using it for two weeks without paying  .  
 i wouldn  t exactly characterize it in that way  .  i think something happened  .  something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him to  .  .  .  what if he showed up  took one look at me and left  ?  
 maybe  there was a subway accident  .  
 and you know  how those express trains create suction  .  
 no trouble at all  .  i think maybe you will meet some of my friends here as well  .  
 oh  that  s alright  .  
 i got a car  so the distance wouldn  t really be a problem  .  
 i  m terribly sorry  won  t you let me pay for  ?  
 yes  of course  .  
 yes  .  but those are the rush in that moment  .  and my boss ask me to do some urgent letters  .  
 a lot  .  i probably got to moonlight for the rest of my life  but so what  it  s worth it  .  come on  get in  .  let  s take a drive  .  
 check out what happens when i put on the brakes suddenly  .  it can stop quickly  .  
 cut out  would you  ?  
 are you done  ?  
 i know  .  maybe we can finish it tomorrow  .  
 you were doing great out there  !  
 again  ?  
 that 's right  even though i did set the alarm last night  .  
 what do you mean too late  ?  
 but thank you very much all the same  .  
 i 've tried  but i ca n't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program  .  
 that 's exactly what i want  thank you  .  
 what if there is no chance  ?  i mean what if you do n't have a partner  what will you do  ?  
 that 's a good idea  .  you are really creative  .  
 oh  through a lot of hard work  of course  .  
 you mean you didn  t know much english then  ?  
 do n't be silly  .  
 hi  ms  .  seymour  ?  it  s allan parker  .  i  ve been waiting to call you and thank you for all your help last week  .  
 thank you very much  mr  .  parker  .  but  that is my job  .  
 3000 rib as bonus for each person  .  
 same here  .  i have't brought any new clothes for three months  .  
 i want to tell you i 've put in my notice  .  
 is that right  ?  i did n't know it  .  
 will you forgive me  .  could you return my camera  ?  
 we can try to lower our cost of production then  .  we need a price that we can compete with  something comparable with the competition  .  
 yes  may i help you  ?  
 our reservation number is j  221  .  
 well  do n't blame me  !  i never get a chance to watch tv  .  
 what does that mean  not big but fat  ?  you did n't buy  .  .  .  
 sorry  .  i take that back  .  i mean the copper buddha you wanted  .  
 i do n't think so  .  did you ever go and look at your stamp  ?  
 do n't be that negative  .  
 how can you be optimistic  ?  you can see it in their eyes  .  
 really  life is so boring  .  
 that 's true  .  the bus is even worse  .  just thinking about taking the bus every day makes me tired  !  hey  how do you get to work every day  ?  
 so you didn  t  .  is that right  ?  
 yeah  after all the explanations like  it  s too heavy  i was in a hurry  .  .  .  whatever  .  
 well  last week i invited her over to dinner  .  my husband and i had no problem with the food  but if you listened to her  then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables  .  there 's just nothing can please her  .  
 my motherinlaw used to do the same thing to us  .  if it was n't disciplining them enough  then we were disciplining them too much  .  she also complained about the food we fed them  the schools we sent them too  and everything else under the sun  .  
 well  it 's just that she put a lot of makeup on her face  .  actually  natural beauty comes from within  .  
 ok  as john after kennedy put it  let us never negotiate out of fear  but let us never fear to negotiate  .  
 not a good day  .  i hate to tell you that mr  .  thomas wants to see the profit  s statement for new project tomorrow morning  .  
 i can  t believe it  .  i guess i  ll be here until 10 again tonight  .  
 you 're so industrious  .  
 it 's very careless of me to have broken your glass  .  
 what 's it  ?  
 the door bell does n't work  the sink is leaking  there 's no hot water  and the building is falling apart  !  
 of course . no girl is more charming  .  
 i think he was locked in it  .  
 oh  to be frank  i think it 's sheer waste of time to watch it  .  
 i sure hope you did n't trust anyone with your credit card number  .  
 all i did so far was make a bid on the buddha  .  it was easy  !  
 slow down  .  what are you talking about  ?  
 it 's about a girl  .  no  an angel  !  i 'm going to the coffee shop where she works right now  .  
 is it waterproof  ?  
 uh  huh  .  .  .  so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for  ?  
 birds of a feather flock together  .  
 it 's quite famous but do n't you think it looks a bit oldfashioned  ?  
 you 're right  but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering  .  
 that  s gorgeous  !  do they have it in a size 8  ?  
 i think this color isn  t quite right for me  .  do they have the same dress in white  ?  
 i think you look fantastic  .  happy birthday  !  
 thanks  .  
 i can tell you worked hard on it  .  
 i do n't want to be like this  .  i think we should get step further  .  
 definitely not  .  
 well  there is a play on campus this weekend  .  
 cool  but what if the weather is not ideal  ?  
 i 'm fed up with his endless talking  .  
 so cool  !  can i get a load of it  ?  
 are you quite sure  ?  
 there was n't really anything that i could do  .  there 's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself  .  if i had said anything  he would have fired for me for sure  .  
 i try to be sensible about it  but it 's not very easy  .  sometimes you just have to grin and bear it  .  
 what do the other people in your apartment think about them  ?  
 i think you 're being a bit optimistic  .  if you met them  you 'd understand  .  
 he told me that if i showed up late one more time  he 'd fire me  .  he 's so mean  !  
 i think i 'm going to look for another job  .  i need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss  .  
 it  s great  .  
 thank you  .  but i  m sorry i  m in a bad mood at the moment  .  
 he must be green  .  it  s lucky that we will get off soon  .  
 i know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood  .  but why not take it easy  ?  
 oh  my god  !  he  s so perfect  .  
 perfect  .  it really hits the spot  .  
 i do n't know  .  i did n't think it was that interesting  .  
 i don  t know what happened to me  .  i just lost it  .  
 no  he is  .  some bosses will bend the rules a bit sometimes  but not my boss  .  he always follows the rules to a t  .  
 yes  everything is fine  .  
 turbulence is pretty normal  is n't it  ?  
 we landed in southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again  .  
 i had a few coffees while i was waiting  .  let 's get out of here  !  
 what else is wrong with it  ?  
 the heating controls do n't work anymore  so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car  even in the summer  !  
 anything else  ?  
 well  let me know when you can get it fixed  .  i  d love to go for a ride in it  !  
 i certainly did  .  do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend  ?  
 no  should i have  ?  
 what  s wrong  ?  i thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking  .  
 yeah but  he is always in a really foul mood  .  i try to find out what  s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but  he always shuts down and brushes me off  .  
 and  ?  
 i ca n't believe how stupid you are  .  why did n't you open the box  ?  
 yes  it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . look  it even had a barcode price sticker on it  !  it looked brand new  .  
 i got offered a new job  !  
 oh yes  .  she had a beautiful wedding in cozumel mexico and we all attended  .  
 such a lovely girl  .  i hope my paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday  !  
 yes  i know  .  fast food is so popular in this district  .  
 anyway  how was your such  catherine  ?  
 that is true  !  here  have some granola for breakfast  .  
 yes  but i bought it when it was on sale  50  off the original price  .  ok  what do you think  ?  
 my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise  .  
 sounds a good idea  .  
 thank you  .  i have roses  tulips  and daffodils  .  do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers  ?  
 thank you  !  that would be very kind of you  .  i have a saw in the garden shed  .  
 i will come clean as soon as we get to safety  ok  ?  for now  you have to trust me  please  !  i would never do anything to hurt you  .  
 what  ?  why didn  t you tell me before  ?  what are you doing here  ?  
 would you like another one  ?  
 no  .  can i have my money back  ?  
 then you might need to pretend to be a little crazy  .  
 yes  i  d like to check three pieces  .  
 let  s see  .  .  .  six hundred and twentyfive us dollars  .  
 and  ?  
 so he said he 'd sell me one for twenty dollars  .  a fourhundreddollar camera for twenty bucks  .  
 listen  carol  .  do n't let this bother you too much . probably it 's nothing  .  just keep your eyes open when you go out . if you see him a third time  and if he follows you again  then i think we should go to the police . but for now  just try not to worry  .  
 so he had the boxes wrapped in plastic  .  
 aha  !  now i understand . you were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . so  what i think is  you deserve to get cheated  !  
 that 's no problem . he just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap  .  that 's easy . and probably it 's the same shop he got the boxes from . maybe his friend works in an electronics store  .  they sell video cameras there . probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around . so they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you . twenty dollars a brick  .  that 's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks  .  
 that 's wonderful  !  icing on the cake  .  
 the early bird catches the worm  .  
 actually  my mother made it from scratch  .  
 yes  .  we had a big talk with him  and he has really turned over a new leaf  .  
 and how long do you you plan to remain in the united states  ?  
 well  i do have assets in my country  .  like i said  i own a house  and see  here  s a bank statement showing my investments  and my bank balance  .  
 ok  make a left here  .   .   .  no wait  i meant make a right  .  come on  speed up  !  
 geez  !  what  s the rush  ?  
 don  t worry about it  just drive  .  oh  no  the light is about to change  .   .   .  step on it  !  
 whatever  .  just turn right here  .   .   .   .  the freeway will be packed at this hour  .   .   .   .  let  s take a side street . go on  !  get out of our way  !  move  move  !  
 here  i know a short cut  .  .  .  just go down here  and we  ll cut though ashburn heights  .  let  s go  let  s go  !  watch out for that lady  !  
 yeah  .  it  s pretty cold  alright  .  
 sir this is the 56th floor  !  we are on the 70th  !  
 license and registration please  .  have you been drinking tonight  sir  ?  
 i had one or two glasses of eggnog  but nothing else  .  
 don  t take that tone with me  .  do you have an invoice for these items  ?  
 thank you  .  you save me  .  
 oh  dear  .  
 you must have realized somebody was here  .  
 what 's wrong  ?  
 when do you go  ?  
 next week  .  
 would n't that take you away from your project  ?  
 it was a kind of sixth sense  .  
 i think you should give it a shot  .  what do you have to lose  ?  you can always change your mind  .  
 really  ?  it is a weekly  is n't it  ?  
 yes  i  d love another glass  .  you  re a wonderful host  .  thank you for everything  .  
 sorry  .  i 'm strictly a spectatorfootball  baseball  basketball  golf  .  .  .  i watch them all  .  
 0kay  .  dinner 's on me  .  
 thanks  i 'll see you around wednesday then  .  
 bye  .  
 thank you  lisa  .  
 here is a present for you  .  i hope you like it  .  
 oh  great  !  i love it  !  you know i 've been expecting this for a long time  .  
 so am i  .  
 wow  !  i 'm so happy for you  .  
 my condolences  .  
 yes  .  i 'd like to swap some of my peanuts for your chips  .  
 do you have any ketchup  ?  
 i went to the beach with my friends and had a barbecue there  .  
 that 's great  .  i 'll pick you up at eight  .  
 goodbye  .  
 i said it 's a lovely day  .  why do n't we go for a walk  ?  
 come on  !  a little labor  much health  .  
 i wonder why  .  
 romantic  ?  i am afraid i like thrillers better  .  
 on the contrary  very exciting  .  
 yes  the sun shines day after day  .  it 's neither too hot nor too cold  .  
 hello  brian  .  
 fantastic  !  i did n't want to come back  .  
 i hear the beaches in thailand are beautiful  .  
 the work is rather hard  but it 's interesting  .  
 nothing much  the same old stuff  .  a lot of bad news as usual  .  
 well  what  s the weather report  ?  
 sunny and mild today  cloudy and rainy tomorrow  .  
 no problem  anytime  .  
 i agree  i think that that would be perfect  !  
 it may not be the best choice for me  but i am considering it  .  
 yes  sometimes giving up a little to move forward is the best choice  .  
 what a great idea  !  
 april might be nice  .  it is far enough away to make the necessary arrangements  .  
 sure  i think that would be possible  .  where is the fundraiser  ?  
 yes  we can do that  .  can we borrow the chairs from the lunchroom also  ?  
 yes  that would be fine  .  just make sure that everything is returned by sunday night  .  
 ok  but make sure that everything is back by sunday night at the latest  .  
 i think there 's more you need to do  .  
 my hair looks awful  .  
 there is that  .  
 i 'll go myself then  .  
 yes  we should  .  
 i try to picture the lord 's face in my mind  .  
 i could help you with that  .  
 should we just meet here  ?  
 i would love to help you prepare for your presentation  .  
 i hate to ask you to do something like that  .  
 i know  fresh fruit flavored is the best ever  .  
 what is your least favorite ice cream  ?  
 one time  i tried garlic ice cream  .  
 i know what you mean  i 've thought about that myself  .  
 you are very welcome  .  come back again  .  
 i agree with that  it just does n't work for me  .  
 what style do you want  ?  
 okay  .  i 'll do it if you 're positive that this is what you want  .  
 i absolutely love it  .  
 it 's going to be  55  .  
 yes  thank you  .  i 've already been helping myself  .  
 sure  i 'd love to  .  i heard sichuan cuisine is very hot  i think i definitely love it  .  
 yeah  ?  i guess so  .  i spent the weekend at beach  .  
 some friends of my parents live out there  and they invited me there  .  
 what happened with that guy at the cafe  ?  
 so are you  .  
 yeah  i 'd better head for home  .  
 what 's your favorite flower  ?  
 in seven days it will be christmas day  .  
 it is hard to guess now  .  both of the teams chose the excellent players this time  .  i guess the game will end in a tie  .  they are equally matched  .  
 count me out  .  
 it 's nice talking to you  .  but i have to go  .  
 hi  ross  .  glad to see you  too  .  
 a party  ?  yes  .  i 'd love to  .  thank you for inviting me  .  will monica come  ?  
 it is hard to get used to a new place  is n't it  ?  
 about 4  .  
 what 's your comment on his new album  ?  
 i love to dance the fast music  .  
 good idea  .  
 how do you like this waltz  ?  
 but  dad  it 's stormy outside  .  
 give her up  .  
 so so  .  
 yes  the dance hall is nice with various styles of music  .  
 i think i 'm your lucky fellow  .  
 in fact  i took up dancing quite recently  too  .  
 certainly  !  i suppose you dance often  .  
 i 'd rather you did n't  .  
 i 'd love to  .  
 what the hell are you doing now  ?  
 let me see  .  what a moving poem  !  
 what can we do next after locating the place  ?  
 all information is filled in and now i can design my zone  .  
 thanks for flattering me  .  i think you dance a lot  right  ?  
 i love rumba and waltz  .  
 sunday papers  .  i usually read them after coming back home from our company  .  
 as you know  i am a sports fan  .  and these papers are famous for their sports section  .  so i will feel relaxed after grasping some information i am interested in  .  
 i get drunk easily  .  
 what 's your meaning  ?  
 me  too  .  
 yes  i like it very much  .  
 you can take a birdeye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain  .  
 all right  !  i stayed up yesterday and waited for your vegetables  .  i stole your peaches and flowers  .  
 i could not agree with you more  .  for us  there are so many unhappy things and i am so bored  however  i got lots of fun from stealing  .  
 but we still need to go back to it  .  do n't overdo it  .  
 i am so sorry to hear that  .  is that enough  ?  
 are you crazy  ?  what are you doing four hours online  ?  
 no  i am not  .  and i love to meet new people in the chat rooms who share a lot in common with me  .  
 no  i listened to the music  too  .  
 well  .  what time would you like me to pick you up  ?  
 bye  .  
 i want to see click  .  
 he can barely make ends meet  .  
 i 'm a teacher  .  
 why not  ?  
 do you want to bet  ?  
 it 's ten thirty  .  
 no  .  have a seat  .  
 they name it after the place where it was first held  .  
 i 'm feeling a little under the weather  .  
 it 's just around the corner  .  
 can i get you another blanket  ?  
 yes  please do that  .  
 i guess it is a formal one because the general director will give a speech there  and most of the staff will take part in  .  
 in that case  formal suit with a nice tie will be better  .  
 the brown leather shoes are ok  .  
 figure skating  .  in my eye  nothing beats it  .  
 of course  the sports shoes don  t go with the formal occasions  .  
 the brown leather shoes go well with your trousers  .  
 it  ll be too late  you  d better take a taxi  .  
 they must have practiced a lot  .  the perseverance has made them they are today  .  
 oh  i 've heard about him before  .  he even created a special dance of sleeve shaking  .  
 so  want me to book the tickets again  ?  
 never mind  .  what about taking a look around the theater  ?  
 yeah  he is going to move next month  .  
 me too  .  but anyway we hope he lives happily in the future  .  
 i know that  .  i have seen the film as the same title  .  andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime from maria to a cheerful governess  .  
 i hope the opera will be more stupendous than the movie  .  have you bought the tickets  ?  
 that was a short relationship  .  you only started dating 2 months ago  .  
 it 's snowing heavily  .  what about taking a walk  ?  
 the fragrance of plum blossoms comes from the hard coldness  .  
 a light brown suit and a pink tie today  and a light blue shirt and a blue tie yesterday  .  a perfect match  !  
 if you happen to find one  please bargain with the owner for it  .  i 'd like to have one  .  it 's interesting to see the integration of the han and mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal  .  
 this sweater is so pretty  .  i love the low neck design  .  
 it was a good thing i had enough on me  .  
 do you see that girl in the red top  ?  she told me who you were  .  
 oh  i am from london as well  .  
 sorry  .  how far is the museum  ?  
 i am not sure  .  we will ask for directions in the coffee shop  .  
 you 've really turned into a health nut  have n't you  ?  
 that sounds great  .  what time should i come over  ?  
 thank you  .  i 'm wearing makeup  .  
 thanks  .  now let 's decide which one of these suits looks best for this occasion  .  
 what  ?  
 and did you like it  ?  
 when i was a kid  there was a weather who said there is no such thing as bad weather  .  
 is that right  ?  
 i 'm glad that you think so  .  i thought it might be a bit too revealing  .  
 when did you go there  ?  
 i was just there a couple of days ago  .  you know  you should go down there too  .  they have a lot of stylish clothes on sale  .  
 that 's the best part  .  it was n't for anything special  .  he just wanted to buy me something  .  
 i would n't mind a necklace  .  i was at the jewelry shop looking around  and they have a couple of beautiful necklaces i want  .  
 why they hold a flour war  ?  
 perfect  .  it will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people  .  
 you did a fabulous job with the selection  .  it 's gorgeous  .  
 thank you so much  .  
 this one is  1500  .  but they range from  600 to  3000  .  
 i hope that they have a good menu  .  most coffee shops only have coffee and danish  .  
 what kind of things would you like to see on the menu  ?  
 sounds fine to me  .  whatever  let 's enjoy this pond first  .  
 maybe they have some good pie  .  
 really  ?  that 's so great  .  congratulations  .  
 are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl  ?  
 there are so many things you have to prepare for  .  
 what do i talk about  ?  
 sure  .  you look like you 're all black and blue  .  
 let me see  .  .  .  the weekend after next looks pretty good . otherwise  i 'm all booked up  .  
 it 's really a small world  is n't it  !  the hammer family is n't very big  .  
 i always make time for family  .  
 that 's good  i 'm usually more comfortable in bigger families  .  
 sounds pretty fun  .  i 'll come out and join you next time  .  
 it 's a very popular game in america  .  
 that 's pretty good  .  let 's do it  .  
 hello  there  my name is tonia  .  
 yeah  i 'm worried  .  if it 's like this tomorrow  our big outdoor party will have to be canceled  .  
 probably my parents  .  
 that 's for sure  .  fruit  cream cakes  medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives  and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids  .  all this  of course  should be well prepared beforehand  .  
 i really appreciate the way you chinese people exchange feelings  .  the holiday 's long enough for you to relax  .  
 i 'm so sorry to hear that  .  but this is a good hospital  .  i 'm sure they will do whatever they can  .  
 hey  i 'll go with you  .  
 we 've heard about that festival before  .  it would be quite helpful if you could give us some highlights of the festival  .  
 i do n't know what to suggest  .  there 're so many attractions  and they all sound interesting  .  one exciting program might be the ten thousand people cycling round the town  .  you can choose from the five routes that lead to different destinations  .  
 wow  must be interesting to watch dragon boats compete against one another on the city river  .  
 you mean as in sylvester stallone  ?  
 hear me out  .  we can pool the money and give it to a family who could really use it  !  
 where did you say  ?  
 it should take at least 20 minutes to get there  .  are there any shuttle buses running place to place around the whole zoo  ?  
 that 's easy  .  anything else  ?  
 will you call his wife and let her know so that if she is available  she can come too  ?  
 my name is phil  .  what 's yours  ?  
 well  i 've been in business for one month now and i have ten clients  .  
 of course  i like  .  
 spring is a lively season  .  
 it is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow  .  i admire the bravery of plum blossoms  .  
 did n't you notice the roses everywhere  ?  
 oh  god  .  i just forgot it  .  i should have brought roses for my girlfriend  .  
 i know the chinese teachers had their first festival in 1985  .  
 i 'm falling in love  .  
 that 's called blind love  .  well  i gotta run  .  tell me how it goes next week  .  
 is there anything i can do  ?  
 no  .  .  .  not really  .  the sad thing is that i was n't there when she died  .  i really wanted to be there one last time  .  
 you 're right  .  .  .  i should eat something  .  let 's go  .  
 jake just broke up with me  .  
 better or worse  it does n't matter  .  i had a lot of feelings for him  .  i really liked him 
 how about coffee down the street  ?  
 my roommate 's having a party  .  
 on the fourth thursday of november  .  
 what do you eat on that day  ?  
 box office ca n't explain everything  .  i do not think it is cheerful or wellmade  .  the plot is old and the female character is not pretty  .  
 it tells the lifetime of a lady singer from a beggar in the street to a famous singer in the world  .  it is a kind of tragedy  .  
 he 's very handsome  is n't he  ?  what 's he like  ?  
 according to mary  he 's divorcing his wife and there 's a big fight going on about the children  .  i thought everyone knew  .  
 i must say i think that is very odd  .  are you absolutely certain it was her  ?  
 well  we could see something different like a detective film  .  
 certainly  .  is there anything wrong  ?  
 sorry  we have sold out the tickets  .  
 ok  .  here you are  .  
 just two  .  
 all right  .  but it 'll be difficult to buy tickets i suppose  .  
 what 's its name  ?  
 it 's about their great love  .  
 good idea  .  let 's goa 
 ok  .  let 's go  .  
 what  s the matter  ?  so angry  .  i  m just playing a joke with you  .  
 look  .  it 's begin  .  
 it 's so interesting  i like it very much  .  
 it is very dull  and the production is n't very satisfactory  either  .  
 let me think  .  oh  awful  !  i still have not finished the chart which was assigned by mr  .  wharton on friday  .  so that task will make my busy  .  
 yes  are advance tickets for nut croakers still available  ?  
 tomorrow  .  
 i have many hobbies  .  i like almost all kinds of sports and i also like to listen to classical music  .  
 i like playing basketball  .  basketball is a very exciting game because it keeps you alert and i also enjoy the team spirit of basketball  .  
 what kinds of films do you enjoy  ?  
 hmm  .  .  .  i 'll tell you what  .  i 'll lend you four thousand dollars  but you have to pay me back next week  .  
 it 's a deal  .  
 i heard they were just married for half a year  .  
 yeah  .  he 's the most experienced athlete in the field  .  
 i live here  .  i was invited by georgehe 's the tall guy over there  .  he looks a bit drunk  actually  .  .  .  
 yes  it 's said that hebes was experiencing six degree strong winds  .  
 good idea  .  i like hanging out in bars at night  .  
 why  ?  
 for killing time and making new friends  .  
 what 's he like  ?  
 you must feel very uneasy at his home  .  
 i 'm getting sick of work man  .  i ca n't take the political bull in the company any more  .  
 now you 're talking  .  
 i 'm not sure yet  .  and you  ?  
 yes  of course  .  
 kobe  .  
 let 's go to watch an nba game tonight  shall we  ?  
 do you like playing table tennis  ?  
 ok  i want you to be happy when we are together  and when you are sad  i would always stay with you  .  
 that 's exactly where i was planning to go  !  
 are you serious  ?  
 no  we are just too different  .  this relationship is n't going anywhere  .  
 i have thought about it for a long time  .  i think it 's time to move on for both of us  .  
 i do n't want to argue with you anymore  .  this is going to be tough  but let 's try to forget that and be friends  .  
 well  you never know  .  i 'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down  but she says she wants to pursue her career while she 's still young  .  
 i have some friends who might be able to help you find a job  .  i 'll see what they can do  .  
 it was a few things  .  the first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary  but she stood me up  !  
 i wanted to  but i knew that if i spoke to her  i 'd just blow up at her  so i decided to just go home  .  i called her later that the night  but she did n't answer the phone  .  
 i hope you 're right  .  
 well  let me see  .  .  .  do you work at ibm corporation  ?  
 nothing planned  .  how about you  ?  
 you 're welcome  bob  .  it was nice meeting you  .  
 i 'm afraid so  .  
 too bad i missed it  .  
 and good shot  !  
 sounds like he is pretty cute  .  what do you think of him  ?  
 he is a nice guy and very considerate  .  i am impressed with how smart and humorous  .  
 i wish i could stay longer  but i must be going  .  
 really  ?  i did n't realize it was so late  .  
 what sort of job do you have in mind  ?  
 i have n't told them  .  maybe i 'll make them know after the vacation  .  
 i 'm out of work at the moment  .  
 i was fired last week  .  
 thank you  .  
 yeah  i agree with you  .  but you know  it  s just one of those things  .  
 where 's your girlfriend  ?  i thought you were going out with her today  .  
 let 's go to starbucks and think of something to do then  .  
 hi  joe  .  
 i am an accountant at a company  .  
 did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow  ?  
 are there any special events going on tomorrow  ?  
 it starts at one pm  .  
 i like to play computer games  read books  go shopping  and play pool  .  
 although i hate to exercise  i go jogging at least twice a week  .  
 that 's a good idea  .  let 's go over the weekend  .  
 what kind of business do you do  ?  
 smaller local companies  .  we specialize in trade  shipping industry  .  
 next monday is my birthday  and i would like you to attend my party  .  
 five o  clock that afternoon  and in my place  you know  ?  
 see you  .  
 what 's he like normally  ?  
 ok  .  i 'll wait here for you  .  
 well  i 'm not one to gossip  as you know  but rumor has it that she sued her former boss for sexual harassment  .  
 there 's a girl in my company that i really like but i always get shy when she is around  .  
 do n't you feel dull  ?  
 me too  .  
 i ca n't stand the loud noise in the city  .  
 the day after tomorrow  .  
 you will go back tomorrow  right  ?  
 maybe you are right  .  
 are you going to get married in the church  ?  
 yeah  oh my god  !  it  s still there  .  we have our first date right on there  .  
 no  thank you  mrs  .  carter  .  i 'm fine for now  .  
 take your pick  julie  .  
 sorry  we have student cards  .  we can get discounts with these  ca n't we  ?  
 here is 50 yuan  .  
 yes  i like pingpong very much  but i ca n't play well  .  
 i am interested in watching tv or other relaxing games  .  
 hi  linda  .  i have two concert complimentary tickets  .  will you go with me tonight  ?  
 let  s meet at the park at 600  .  
 you 're in one of those inbetween stages  are n't you  .  
 have you thought about wearing a hat  ?  
 wow  you were pulling my leg all along  .  i was really fooled  .  
 what does she like to do  ?  
 what if someone got it in their head to give them a tug  ?  what then  ?  
 you come dressed in anything from the sixties  .  
 she wished good luck to you  .  
 yes  .  
 what for  ?  
 they must have just come back from tomb sweeping because today is tomb sweeping day  .  
 sure  .  
 certainly  .  it  s actually the chinese new year and is regarded by the chinese as the most important holiday of the year  .  
 what happens on the holiday  ?  
 can you get it  ?  
 i will  .  merry christmas  .  
 well  i wish you good luck  !  
 anytime  .  you can reach me at 5558929  .  
 thanks  .  
 yes  i have  .  i collect stamps  chinese stamps as well as those from other countries  .  
 happy new year  steven  .  
 now  .  you can see why it 's called the lantern festival  .  
 sure  .  but you know that i ca n't read any chinese characters  .  what do they say  ?  
 now we have a twoyearold boy  .  we 're very happy that he 's healthy and smart  .  
 right now he speaks mostly english  and he can say a few chinese words  .  but he will learn in the future  .  
 yes  people surely can  .  he 's whiter than the chinese kids  and his hair is a little blonde  .  my husband says his eyes are very chinese though  .  
 no  what  ?  
 pretty good  .  what brings you here  ?  
 i came to see my uncle  .  he lives in the next block  .  
 not bad  .  what did you do  ?  
 ok  i  ve been looking for a job for days  and i haven  t found one yet  .  it 's so hard finding work these days  .  have you had any luck  ?  
 there  s no rush  .  you can see him tomorrow  .  i  ve told him about you  .  he promised to give you the job  .  
 i hope not  .  
 the fans are great here  too  .  not like in philadelphia  .  
 i 'm standing in front of an exquisite work of art  !  
 i 've seen it so many times in books  but i never imagined i 'd get to see it in person  .  
 one of the girls in my office  .  
 leave it to me  .  i know exactly where to find it  .  
 good morning  pete  .  
 well  i think you look very pretty in your polka dot purple dress with your hair piled at the rear  .  that makes you very graceful and mysterious  .  
 would you like orchestra seats  ?  
 hi tina  it 's joe  .  
 i was watching the news a little earlier  .  they said it 's probably going to snow tomorrow  .  
 soda or water  ?  
 all right  .  please wait for a minute  .  
 well that 's great  !  it 's nice that we have something in common  .  
 i just got off the subway  .  i 'm almost there  .  sorry i 'm late  .  
 do you want to get something to eat later  ?  
 no  i 'm still full from dinner  .  
 from midnovember  snow started to pile up in ottawa  .  
 i think i will be adapted to it  .  
 well  i still have n't finished my christmas shopping  .  do you want to go shopping with me this weekend  ?  
 i 'd like to  but i 'm not sure if i can  .  work has been really busy lately  .  why do n't we go on friday instead  ?  
 matinee or evening  ?  
 i agree  .  but even though i like comedies  i usually prefer more serious films  .  my favorite movie is  titanic  .   
 really  ?  well the special effects might have been good in 1997  but when you watch it today they make the film seem really cheesy  .  
 what other expenses will we have  ?  
 i know  !  i do n't get them at all  .  but wait  is n't terminator a scifi movie  ?  
 on top of that  there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs  which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city  .  
 sure  .  does she know your friend  ?  
 no wonder your english is so good  .  
 actually  it 's not that good  .  i can read but i ca n't speak very well  .  i have n't had a lot of chance to practice  .  
 that sounds cool  .  do you mind if i recommend myself for the job  ?  
 please go ahead  i am listening  .  
 is your back door higher than the ground level  ?  
 yes  orange juice will be fine for me  .  but how can you get the drink  ?  it 's so crowded there around the counter  .  you can barely move  .  
 susan suggested the one on main street  .  she says it is very good  .  
 yes  .  it is everest  also called zhumulangma in china  .  it is 8844  .  43 meters above the sea level  .  
 can i have a look as well  ?  
 yes  next saturday  .  i hope you can make it  .  
 yes  .  what did you think of it  ?  
 yes  .  he was excellent  .  they worked well together  do n't you think  ?  
 yes  !  
 then what should i do  ?  
 what was that like  ?  
 i  m temping at a pharmaceutic company  .  
 that  s a big family  .  how old is your brother  ?  
 do you miss your family  ?  
 let 's watch a movie or something  .  
 i think they 're playing lord of the rings 
 how about at the subway entrance  .  
 what are you doing  ?  
 do n't worry about it  .  i keep forgetting everyone 's birthdays as well  .  
 the food was excellent  but jane ordered a birthday cake  which they forgot about  .  so as you can see  you were not the only one  .  
 oh  no  .  
 in the end it was a nice evening and i got an ipad as my birthday present which i wanted for a while  .  
 alright  .  but why is downloading music better than buying cds at the store  ?  
 sure  .  but  it will be a long hike  30 miles in three days  .  have you been hiking before  ?  
 well  bring him along too  .  we  ll have a great time this weekend  .  
 not bad  .  thank you  .  you look great today  .  and how is your husband  ?  
 oh  .  
 all right  !  
 which team do you think will win  ?  
 that sounds great  .  but how do you know that 's a crush or a real love  ?  
 no problem  .  let 's say 630 p  .  m  .  at the royal restaurant  ok  ?  
 well  maybe they 've got a point  .  i mean  i suspect that they think the same about us  .  
 i asked if there was anything i could do to help his family  and i told him that i could be a shoulder for him to cry on  .  
 really  ?  we have only one chance every year  .  
 maybe  .  but it provides much wider space for me to improve the skills and increase the experience  .  what about you  ?  
 ah  my girlfriend wanted to see that movie  .  i have to take her later so i do n't want to watch it ahead of time  .  how about the cube  ?  
 about two years  .  and you  ?  are you based here  ?  
 i think i will  .  thanks for the info  .  
 you got it  .  well  he walked up to me and said my name again and then i realized it was the boy i had been thinking about  the one from third grade  !  
 oh  this  ?  i got it in singapore  .  here  do you want to take a look  ?  
 what  s wrong  ?  that was a great goal  .  
 yes  but i bet  200 dollars on the cougars  !  
 looks like you  re going to lose out on this game then  .  
 i can  t believe it  !  i thought the cougars were going to win for sure  .  
 of course not  .  if you 're feeling bad and want to let your emotions out  you can just say whatever you want to me  .  
 i 'm going to put on more clothes  too  .  
 yes  when it snows  every where is white  .  it 's very beautiful  .  
 i can hardly stand these wet and cold days  .  it seems that it does n't bother you very much  .  
 you 'll be out to see me next year  as you promised  ?  
 hi  tom  .  how have you been  ?  
 i think money will make me happy  .  
 you 'll get bored eventually  .  
 very well  .  how 's mrs  .  clinton  ?  
 not bad  .  but she 's as busy as before  .  
 oh  !  that 's much hetter than i did  .  
 it 's a pleasure  .  come on  .  i 'm on your side  .  
 we will have a party here  right  ?  
 you never guess she is going to have a baby  .  
 but sometimes it is so hard to tell the truth  .  
 yeah  i 've been out of town  .  
 so how have you been  ?  
 yeah  this sucker is the fastest thing i 've ever owned  .  
 i am afraid i can  t this afternoon  .  i take my daughter to her tennis class at the club on wednesday afternoons  .  
 was it quite special  ?  
 wonderful  .  
 in order to prevent the fish from eating the poet 's body  .  
 just did my best  .  
 getting cheaper is not the only reason for their popularity . they come with a lot of inviting functions  .  
 so everybody 's getting video mail  .  
 of course  .  that 's why i bought this type  .  i can change its case frequently  so it is novel to use it  .  
 i do n't think so  .  it changes so quickly this time  .  
 good idea  .  thanks a billion  .  
 it 's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do  .  many people resolve to quit smoking  lose weight  or stop nagging their wife  etc  .  however  it usually lasts only for a few days  !  
 superb  !  it 's a 4 megapixel one and the photos it takes are very vivid and clear  .  
 in that case  i 'll be seeing you  .  
 yes  the snow is often falling thick and fast here  .  
 there are so many places around  .  take a look at the advertisement  .  
 no  thank you  .  please tell him to phone me when he comes back  .  
 there 's no need  i have keyless entry  and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car  .  now  we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home  .  
 using gps i can rely on this to direct me home  .  now i just need to find my ecard to automatically open the gate and we can drive out  .  
 certainly  .  come back soon  .  
 sorry  i have no photo in my computer  .  and i have no scanner  .  i will show you later  .  
 ok  !  before that i 'll take this one as you  .  
 i have no champagne right now  .  how about this  ?  
 are you sleepy  ?  
 thx . bye for now  .  kisssssssssss  .  
 do you write or call them very much  ?  
 lucky her  .  anyway  i think that is just as beautiful  .  
 i know  .  i wonder what 's keeping him  .  
 well  i think it 's the time to pull the plug  .  
 right  !  
 ahahah  and i thought you were tired  .  
 sure does  .  hey  can i sponge a little cash of you  ?  
 hey  great set of wheels  .  
 lots  .  looks like i 'll have to moonlight for the next two years  .  
 i can imagine  .  
 so many  ?  
 my father supports the family  and he is the sole breadwinner  .  my mother is a housewife  .  
 do you live with your family  ?  
 yes  membership fees vary depending on the club but usually they run into tens of thousands of dollars  .  
 very few  unfortunately  .  
 how was your game today  ?  
 my drives were terrible today  .  i kept slicing the ball into the roughs and sand traps  .  
 at least you have n't landed in the water yet  .  i 've done that on the last two holes  .  
 could you hand me my wedge  ?  i 'll try  .  .  .  
 no way  mary  .  i 'm going to let you go first  .  i do n't want the pressure of putting first  .  
 they must be amazing animals  .  
 they sure can  .  maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes  .  
 thanks  .  it 's a lot better than mine  and it 's new  .  
 yes  she 's lived there for about ten years  .  
 which one is hers  ?  
 the blue suv in front of the honda  .  
 what is your job  ?  
 so you have to work all day  .  
 oh  my god  .  a diamond brooch  .  it 's so beautiful  .  you 're so kind to me  a  .  thank you  !  
 in any case  i like baby showers  because they allow friends and family to share the joy and excitement of welcoming a new life into the world  .  
 i 'm glad too  .  steven  i want to tell you that i 'm going to divorce my wife  .  
 we do n't get along well with each other and fight a lot  .  
 yes  they are great fun and very challenging  too  .  some day i 'll want to try deepsea diving and rockclimbing  too  .  
 where was this picture taken  ?  
 it looks like you all had a nice time  .  
 yeah  it was a lot of fun  .  
 hmm  .  .  .  it 's hard to figure out the exact size  i 'm afraid  .  
 thank you very much  david  .  it 's an excellent birthday gift  .  
 never thought about it  i sure you are right  .  it 's quite a short walk  .  
 haha  see you then  .  
 i traveled the three gorges  .  
 true  .  with the extension of railways and highways  and the improvement of safety and capacity of airplanes  ships and boats have been giving place to trains  planes and automobiles  .  
 but the most of the transoceanic cargo transportation is still carried by boat  .  
 if boys grow up with computer games  they will surely become bad  .  
 come on  .  things are not so bad  .  boys can learn to use the computer through games  .  
 all right  .  what should i take  ?  
 just take your golf club  .  i will pick you up borrow  .  
 see you borrow  .  
 not really  !  
 well  i heard david has been fired  .  
 really  ?  he looks so young  .  
 i do n't understand  .  you do n't even know the friends you are talking to  !  
 yes  i 'm a very good mother and successful career woman  .  
 a boss likes him a lot  .  he says jim is a good team player  .  
 everybody would like to have jim on their team  .  because he is funny and helpful and he can contribute a lot to the team he belongs to  .  
 right  .  
 i know  .  and you should be more careful  too  .  
 you did a good job  .  but i got tired of working in the garden  .  
 does it work  ?  
 sure  .  but it is too cold today  .  i have to put on warm clothes and look stupid  .  
 hackers are smart  and they want people to know about it  .  
 but we need the wood  .  
 since we live in the same neighbourhood  maybe we can help each other from now on  .  
 thank you  .  i will  .  
 hi  .  steven  .  i just drop in and want to have a chat with you  .  
 brothers  ?  do you know why they quarreled  ?  
 no  i have n't  .  i 'm so surprised at the news  .  
 i have to say you 're a wellmatched couple  .  
 i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight  .  who do you think will win  ?  
 my husband is betting on france  .  
 maybe we can find a place to learn some chinese cooking  .  i hear there 's a place in chinatown where you can take some courses  .  are you interested  ?  
 what a lovely dog  !  how did you know i love this  ?  
 cheer  !  
 where to meet  ?  
 well  you 're here  .  and that 's the main thing  .  
 yes  i will  .  
 it 'll begin at nine o 'clock sharp  .  
 ok  .  goodbye  .  
 take care and give my best to you parents  .  
 is it  ?  i had no idea it was so late  .  i must be off now  .  
 not at all  .  
 you 're most welcome  .  
 if so  we may live there someday  .  
 indeed  no man can be perfect  .  he is just soso in crashing the boards  .  usually he plays shooting guard  .  rebounding might not be his strong suit  .  
 well  nothing more than a jumble of photographs  .  
 come on  you think about what to wear almost every day  .  there are thousands of clothes in your wardrobe  .  
 oh  really  ?  but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well  .  
 no  thanks  .  i 've decided to give up smoking  .  
 well  it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more  you should stop doing it  .  
 who  ?  me  ?  could't give up smoking  ?  nonsense  !  of course i could  !  i know i could  !  
 how do you know  ?  
 why do n't you phone her for a date again  ?  
 do you think they 'll become reconciled  ?  
 in the kitchen  with his wife by his side he still puts on quite a dinner time show  .  
 nearly everything  .  
 come on  .  
 yes  their new album just came out last week  .  it is number one on the billboard  .  
 have you fallen in love  ?  
 yes  i watched united play chelsea  .  what a fierce battle  !  allay were engaged in intensive pressing and tackling in midfield  .  well  it was not like a normal english league match  .  
 yeah  .  we are lucky  .  let 's go buy the tickets first  .  we can have breakfast later  .  i am so hungry  .  
 good idea  .  
 i 'll never again come to your side  i am turn away now and ca n't return  .  
 well  now you know  .  let 's go to the lake over there  .  some people are fishing over there  .  i have n't had a chance to fish in a lake  i really want to try  .  
 i think we need to buy some baits and borrow some fish poles first  .  
 that sounds really attractive  .  let 's go to that candy shop now  .  
 they have lollypops  chocolate drops  fruit candy  mints  pearbrittles and toffee  .  they are in different colors and flavors  .  
 i want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything  .  
 to be honest  i care only about whether i can have some delicious candy eat  .  i could n't care less about whether the shop is popular or not  .  
 you are a candy terminator  .  be careful or you 'll get a lot of cavities  .  
 maybe so  .  but a law banning cigarettes would do no good  .  
 thank you  but alice is only a visitor here  .  i do n't know if she 'll keep it  .  
 yeah  it 's true  .  what is she going to do  ?  
 that 's not bad  .  it could be a shortterm alternative  .  your mum can look for another one when the market improves  .  things will work out eventually  .  
 that 's right  .  
 how old is she  ?  
 well  .  .  .  
 i guess i do n't earn enough  .  
 no  not at all  .  very straight  .  her hair comes down like this  .  .  .  just over the ears  .  
 does she wear glasses  ?  
 if it 's within the legal limit  i prefer to keep it  .  
 it seems quite normal to me  .  it is pretty much what i want to do  .  
 is that so  ?  well  what kind of bait are you using  ?  
 oh no  i ca n't tell you  .  it 's a secret  .  say  why do n't you go over by the lily pads and try fishing there  ?  
 do you think that 's a good spot  ?  
 certainly not  .  what really counts is to play as a team  passing the ball amongst each other  dodging defenders  .  free kicks are a result of all the teammates collective efforts . however  a few free kicks often make everything different  especially scoring one such goal in the nick of time  .  
 where does a broadcast company get most of their information  ?  i hope it 's not just from press releases  .  
 literature and economy  .  
 by the way  would you like to see movies  ?  
 i like to play golf  play badminton or crack jokes  .  
 you 're leaving so soon  ?  i wish you stayed a little longer  .  
 what do you usually do with them  ?  
 we like to get together  chat and enjoy beautiful music  .  
 there are three  my parents and i  .  
 how nice  .  
 a minute  please  .   .  .  .  yes  this way  please  .  
 all right  .  may i have your name  ?  
 my surname is gao  .  
 how do you spell it  sir  ?  
 the seats are excellent  .  we 're right in the center  .  
 in the united states  yes  .  but back in china  i went to concerts a couple of times with my parents  .  
 why do you listen to rap  ?  
 ten  .  
 chinese food  .  
 how much would you like to spend for each person  ?  
 mao tai and qingdao beer  .  
 he seems to win awards everywhere  .  
 i heard one observer even said it was a song sung in spanish for international football  and he made it so popular that even the americans loved it  .  
 they 're quite popular now  .  was n't her voice good  ?  
 why  ?  
 okay  .  but you have to admit that it was an exciting story  especially with that surprise ending  .  
 that 's great  .  m ost of my family is coming home too  .  
 that 's too bad  .  so  what did you ask for christmas this year  ?  
 i hope that i get what i asked for  .  
 let 's string the lights first . then we wo n't have to mess up the decorations  .  
 do n't you think it 's a sheer waste of both time and money  ?  
 yes  .  
 tell me in details  .  
 oh  that 's great  .  i want to try later  .  
 why not  ?  
 what 's the matter  ?  
 just relax  .  that 's because you 're new to chat  .  let me take a look  .  
 yep  it should be here by tomorrow night  .  
 everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games  .  
 what was the actual score  ?  
 when do the playoffs start  ?  
 no  but i heard about that angelina jolie and brad pitt did n't attend  .  
 thank goodness we 're not rich and famous  !  
 they are  .  the only reason they did n't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards  .  
 not anymore  !  can you believe it  ?  they 've decided that pluto is not a planet anymore  !  
 nice try  .  i was n't born yesterday  you know  .  
 we actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos  .  
 i have n't yet  .  i just keep hoping it 's just a phase he 's going through  .  
 well  i guess you do n't want this note  then  .  
 yeah  i want the note  .  
 speaking  .  who 's calling  please  ?  
 okay  .  i 'll pick you up at 600  .  
 but she wants to learn the butterfly stroke 
 cool down  man  .  everyone is fed up with the rushhour traffic  .  but life is n't really all that  .  you should take the initiative and make some changes first  .  
 do you have any plans  ?  
 fine  just fine  .  and you  ?  
 happy birthday to you  !  i 'd really love to come  but i 'm not sure right now  .  i 'll try to make it . thank you for your invitation  .  
 no  thanks  .  i 'm on diet  .  
 ice cream  please  .  
 romantic  ?  i ca n't remember what that word means  .  
 that sounds good  .  
 how about  run of the mill  ?   
 at least one for your trip  .  
 round and frame are two different terms  .  
 perhaps you can tell me a little more about this  .  
 i do n't think it was the problem with your hands  you did several excellent spares  .  you have no problem with your hands  .  
 the problem is you are too nervous  .  you want to have a strike so much  so you deliver the ball too hard  .  and when it comes to the i second roll  there 's no pressure  .  that 's why you could bowl all those spares  .  
 i certainly can try  .  .  .  no  !  it went straight through the wickets  .  
 i was born on april 15  1986  .  
 okay  .  
 what do you do with it  ?  
 do you want to go to an exhibition  ?  there is one at the xinghai exhibition hall tomorrow  .  
 but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together  .  
 where did you visit  ?  
 why did you go there  ?  
 i went there on business  .  
 yes  and i look many pictures  .  
 of course there is  .  the toplevel coaches there are from the state sports general administration  .  
 no  quite the opposite  .  i thought i 'd never stop falling down  .  then all of a sudden i started skiing much better  .  
 not on your life  !  i know i 'd break my leg 
 i have no reason to distrust him  .  he 's never caused any harm  .  
 what 's your favorite dance  ?  
 to tell you the truth  i do n't like it  .  it 's too noisy  .  
 and the tango  ?  
 sure  .  first we 'll go buy a newspaper and then we 'll go to the library  .  
 i hope so too  .  i 'll give him a call when we get there  .  
 but i 'm already in a lot of trouble with my boss  .  
 it 's 8 sharp by my watch  .  
 i know little of her  .  i only think she  s pretty and intelligent  .  of course  she  s diligent  too  .  
 that  s enough for you to worship the ground she treats on  .  
 thank you very much  .  
 that 's all right  .  i hope we can help you at some other time  .  goodbye  .  
 ok  well  my friends and i are planning on going to the beach on sunday  .  we tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere  so you could still sleep in  .  do you want to come with us  ?  
 that  s great  !  i think they do you a lot of good  .  
 you are really a good citizen  .  
 i know  .  but i  m not ready for married life yet  .  
 he 's going to turn six next month  .  
 my motherin  law  .  she retired last year  .  
 have you sent out invitations by our party  ?  
 yes  i have  .  
 hi  good morning  you are so early today  .  
 wow  that  s quite a long journey  .  do you drive a car  ?  
 thank you for the invitation  .  i 'll be very happy to go  .  
 fine  .  see you then  .  
 things are tough all over  .  you should never give up  !  
 really  ?  i 've never heard that before  .  i just like it  .  
 yes  .  what about you  ?  
 yes  florida had great weather while we were there  .  you look tan  too  .  did you go somewhere  ?  
 did you go diving while you were there  ?  
 what if old people are in poor health and need to be looked after  ?  
 young people ought to carry out their responsibilities  .  if it 's needed  they would live with their parents  .  
 i 'm good  .  how are you  ?  
 yes  .  
 what did you say  ?  
 good idea  .  
 oh  you went to the wedding  ?  
 no  he did n't tell me about it  .  do n't feel bad  .  
 they want to be filthy with dough and think it the only source of their happiness  .  
 they are blind with bucks  .  blind people are more easily conned  fo course  .  
 all right  just a quick one  .  
 yes  of course  .  thank you very much  .  
 yes  why not  ?  don  t you like etv  ?  
 ok  let 's go  .  
 i 'd love to  .  
 i love this art exhibition  !  
 i 'd like that very much  .  
 fine  .  see you later  .  
 really  ?  i want to go  too  .  
 i am not  !  
 he 's still pretty sick  .  
 yes  i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday  .  
 i 'll tell him  .  thanks for asking about him  .  
 i do feel like an outdoor exercise  .  after all  we have n't had such a beautiful day for a long time  .  
 he has a bad cold  .  
 let 's just hope it does n't get cold again  .  
 sorry  i ca n't go today  .  
 how about tomorrow night  ?  
 the italian restaurant on 5th street  .  
 thursday  .  
 so the weekend is coming  !  how about seeing a film  !  
 no  that 's too early  .  i 'll still be at work then  .  
 no  but she speaks english fluently  .  
 yeah  .  
 yeah  !  but you know sometimes the weather forecast is not correct  .  maybe tomorrow is a clear day  .  who knows  ?  
 that 's ok  .  
 i stayed up last night  .  
 it 's nothing to get upset about  .  
 well  i like playing the violin  .  
 really  ?  how long have you been playing the violin  ?  
 where did you learn  ?  
 3 weeks  .  
 yes  she just got here yesterday  .  
 that 's great  .  we can go to the bank together  .  
 nope  .  you can use the credit card to withdraw the money in foreign countries  .  
 no  .  it is free of charge  .  
 is there anything i can do  ?  
 that 'll be fine  .  here you are  .  
 what are you going to do now  ?  
 we are going to try the new one that opened up on 17th street  .  
 i hear the drinks and food there are moderately priced . you should be fine  .  
 one last question . is there a dress code there  ?  
 okay  .  see you then  .  
 i suggest that we go and ask for help from the policeman  .  
 not a bit  .  
 yes  .  how about donating some money  ?  
 i lost the table tennis game yesterday  .  
 oh  what a pity  !  
 do you know any secrets to china 's success  ?  
 you are kind  .  look there is a big tree over there  it looks like a thousandyearold tree  .  
 let 's eat at the restaurant across the street from my apartment  .  
 oh  i think i know the place you mean  .  we ate there last month  right  ?  
 that 'll be for you to decide  .  i 've got a new dish that i want to try out on you  .  
 he 's quite a patient teacher  too  .  
 it 's not raining  darling  .  the bench is n't wet  .  
 come off it  mary  .  
 you certainly do like teasing me  mary  .  well i 'm in love with someone  .  the question is  how do i get his attention  ?  
 that i ca n't go on any longer without you  .  
 and i hope so  .  this is what you were meant for  .  say you love me  say yes  say yes  .  
 as far as i know  insomnia is usually caused by stress  .  are you stressed at all  ?  
 you  re right  .  i usually end up staring at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class  .  
 i have a lot of work to do in the company recently  .  
 how is your family  ?  
 that was the first thing we did  .  i have a few pictures  .  do you want to see them  ?  
 you do n't look very happy in that picture  .  
 thank you  .  i 'll certainly be there  .  
 i used to swim a lot  but now i 'm taking gym classes  .  
 that 's right  .  and his wife is a baby doll  too  .  she used to have many followers  .  
 where are you from  ?  
 i 'm moblogging  !  
 that depends  .  what does she look like  ?  
 does she have any piercings or tattoos  ?  
 you really have keen eyes  .  
 well  i 'm not sure  .  maybe it means we can buy something through the internet  .  
 this dish tastes terrific  .  would you like to try a little  ?  it is a little hot  but very good  .  
 oh  yes  !  i completely forgot about it  .  
 sure  .  meet me at five  .  
 oh  just olives please  .  what music is this  ?  
 the other night when you came home there was lipstick on your right cheek  .  how do you explain that  ?  
 my aunt mary just flew in from cleveland and she laid one right on my right cheek  .  
 because you are the most handsome boy at the university and i love you so much  !  i guess i just go crazy sometimes  .  that 's all  .  
 i 'm okay  .  what are you doing these days  ?  
 probably in a week or two  .  i 'll let you know  .  
 i 've been really busy  .  how is everything  ?  
 yes  i think i am  .  let 's meet for lunch at mouth restaurant  .  
 we 're all familiar with natural disasters  .  but we still feel weak when we face wenchman earthquake  .  
 right  .  but people at that time only know two words   save  and  assistance   they will never do n't lift a finger  .  life is the most important compared with anything else  .  
 yeah  i got home around two  .  
 believe me  you really look much better than before  .  
 ca n't you wait till you get home  ?  then you can surf the internet using the broadband  wireless connection or whatever you like  .  
 no  i 'm not feeling myself  .  i just want to check my emails  visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends  .  
 actually  this is a kind of addiction called infomania or information overload  .  
 now i can tell you 're definitely addicted to the overflow of information 
 what do you usually write about  ?  
 got it  .  are you still updating your blog  ?  
 how 's life going  zhang lin  ?  
 i tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her  !  she 's so busy these days that it 's just impossible to hang out with her  .  
 i still think you two should try to patch things up  .  
 it was great  .  the director took a lot of care while framing  .  they say be has good chance at winning the oscar for best director  .  also i like the actors  some really great new young actors  .  
 i do n't know  .  maybe a pair of new shoes  .  
 let me think about it for a minute  .  let 's see  .  .  .  oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue  !  give me a second and it 'll come to me  .  
 my what  ?  oh  that  right as a trivet  .  
 nice to meet you  too  .  
 nice meeting you  kevin  .  i hope to see you again  .  
 sure  let 's  .  goodbye  then  .  
 here you are  .  
 i completely forgot about your cat allergy  .  i took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago  .  oh no  .  we 'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine  .  let 's go  .  
 whatever you say  .  i just want to get to my meeting  !  
 is he living in the new housing estate in killington  ?  
 he still has a complaint though  .  
 there 's been bad blood between them since bobbie took away john's girlfriend  .  
 maybe i am a barbie doll  but i won  t do barbie doll things  .  
 that 's true  .  
 i bet you she regrets what she  s done  .  you were such a good catch  !  she really lost out  didn  t she  ?  
 i know  .  it  s always nice to have some closure  but i don  t think you  ll have a problem finding another girlfriend  .  
 yes  but i am out of food and milk  .  
 i have been using the store across town for years  .  
 well  you should try my store  .  the prices are good  .  
 and  ?  
 you know what they say 'a friend to all is a friend to none  .  i don  t feel like i really know any of my friends  .  in fact  i should probably call them acquaintances  not friends  .  
 what about me  ?  i  m your friend  .  
 my husband and i got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses  .  but then we had three parties to celebrate  .  
 you are bragging again  .  
 i am reading a book about money management  .  
 what type do you like the best  ?  
 yeah  unfortunately  nowadays directors are often more interested in making money than making a good film  .  
 well  sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community  .  you  d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day  but you would definitely save money doing it that way  .  
 no  .  what 's it like  ?  
 yes  i know  .  he 's really on the alist  .  
 no problem  .  however  maybe i should come early to help you prepare the dinner  .  
 don  t worry  .  i will arrange everything  .  
 thank you  .  my wife would be very happy to hear this  .  
 till the end of the week  .  
 i  ve been to qingdao before  so i  ll choose dalian  .  i 've heard that the environment there is very good  .  
 yes  that 's a good place to spend a holiday  .  last year i went there  .  it 's really  .  
 thank you  !  
 it 's friday  .  
 thank you for saying that  .  
 i appreciate what you have done for me . everything i have seen here has left a deep impression on me  .  i really do n't know how to express my thanks to you  .  
 will you be kind to say  thank you  to mr . zhang and other friends for me  ?  
 don  t worry  .  i do n't think you  re going to lose your job over one mistake  .  
 it was a rather big mistake  .  when you work as an investment adviser  one small mistake can cost the company millions  .  
 really  ?  have you ever been there  ?  
 can you go there with me  ?  i 'd like someone who is familiar with that area to go with me  .  
 i hope this won  t be our last meeting  .  
 like what  ?  
 that 's great news  !  you look much more relaxed than you did yesterday  .  
 we contact through email  .  
 email is not always the best form  .  i think qq is way better  .  
 actually me  too  .  
 not always  and there 're also few cars  !  
 i 'm from new york  .  oh  this is my stop  .  bye  robin  .  
 that means it 's developing very fast  .  
 so  what do you want to do  ?  
 great  !  let 's make a reservation  .  
 how about some salad to go with your chicken  ?  
 yeah  fortunately it did not cause a disaster  .  
 no  i was n't  .  i came here in 1992  .  
 how old were you  ?  
 did you have fun there  ?  
 would you ask him to tell us more about the country  ?  
 yes  he once gave her seven roses  .  
 we 'd better prepare for the worst  .  
 so am i . the doctor says she 'll get over in a month  .  
 i hope your grandfather will recover soon  .  
 i was planning to attend gradate school  but then i was offered a good job doing marketing  so i changed my mind  .  
 sounds like you 're happy with your decision  .  
 the son gave a nice speech about his father  .  
 that is a lot of friends  .  do you have a best friend  ?  
 that 's very nice of you  .  
 yes  .  
 me too  .  
 this city is full of jerks  .  
 rude people are everywhere  .  
 i do n't know  .  i just woke up  .  
 why do n't you look outside  ?  
 okay  .  it looks like rain  .  
 no  .  
 i 'm an open book  .  watch me all you want  .  
 you wo n't catch me  because i love you  .  i 'm not a cheater  .  
 you bet it  .  
 do you have a ride home  ?  
 no  we live in the suburbs  .  what about you  ?  
 do you have a car  ?  
 katherine  ?  well  she 's good at languages  .  
 that means it will get hotter  .  
 yeah  .  i studied on sunday evening  .  what about you  ?  
 that sounds like fun  but did you exercise  ?  
 oh  really  ?  what do you do there  ?  
 oh  ?  where do you work  ?  
 which restaurant  ?  
 that 's good  .  not evey company provides employees with training opportunity  .  it seems that your company wants to further develop their employees and encouragelifelong learning  .  
 we have to participate in training after a busy day and during the weekend  .  you know  after work all you want to do is throw yourself onto your bed  .  and during the weekend  you just want to stay at home and enjoy a family dinner  .  
 really  ?  does she live here in seattle  ?  
 thanks  .  i 'd love to  .  what time is the show  ?  
 why are you asking me the strange question  jerry  ?  
 that s true  but what if one comes across some difficulties  .  he must rely on his eq to deal with them  .  
 quite right  .  have you noticed that a high iq is not a must for one 's success  ?  
 no  a lot of women stay home and take care of their families  .  but some work  .  
 but how can we identify someone if we do n't know their race  ?  
 then they also should n't tell us if the robber is male or female  because that is sexist  .  
 brian  !  how have you been  ?  
 i 'm doing really well  .  
 julie  do you know who that woman is over there by the window  ?  
 you like to communicate with him  ?  
 ok  i will  .  you have said that many times  .  
 are you hungry  ?  do you want me to buy something for you to eat  ?  
 good to meet you too  .  
 how terrible  !  
 it sounds marvelous  .  thank you for your help  .  
 what 's strange about that  !  as a person born under the sign of cancer  i am homeloving and wish for a peaceful family life  .  but according to astrology  sagittarius guys are too adventurous and risktaking . they seldom think of leading a settled and peaceful life  .  
 yes  .  the ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth  and they have developed into a festival filled with food  performances and games now  .  
 i just ca n't wait to see them  .  which one do you choose today  ?  
 what about tianqiao temple fair  ?  a variety of opera performances  acrobatics shows  and food will dazzle you  .  
 what  s wrong with that  ?  
 what is that below  ?  
 yeah  i know  but it 's too hard to do  .  
 you mean lily 's boyfriend  ?  
 of course not  .  let 's talk to him in a very friendly way  .  
 ok  it  s better to be far away from him  .  
 i did  but he gives me a runaround  .  
 yes  both  .  last trip i fished a little and hiked five miles  .  
 yeah  you 're right  .  
 i know clearly at the bottom of my heart  .  i just ca n't set my mind at rest because of the child  .  she 's little  .  she cannot understand us and accept such truth  .  
 yeah  .  
 why do n't you date up a handsome guy and spend time together  ?  
 you must have a lot in common and a barrel of fun  .  
 i don  t know  .  but he must be a big shot  .  
 yeah  but he refused to take the medicine  .  
 what did it say about you then  ?  
 well  who all is going to be there  ?  
 oh  that 's too bad  where can you park around here  ?  
 oh  .  no  .  the motor coach is airconditioned  there is a galley for food preparation  movies or music are available for your entertainment and attendants are there to take care of your every need  .  
 alright  all joking aside  what kinds of moves do you like  ?  
 is it convenient and cheap  ?  
 sure  .  you can send email to each other every day through the internet  .  in addition  you can make a phone call through the internet  too  .  
 no problem  .  i 'll tell you  .  
 what 's the trouble  ?  
 the department manager is all over her  .  he says he loves her  .  
 what about your friend  ?  did she fall for him  ?  
 i know she is quite an article  but i was not sure of her ability to cope with a boss  .  
 let  s have a try  .  
 are you going to have a birthday party  ?  
 you know in china we usually do n't open presents until the guests leave  .  
 really  ?  i 've already opened this one . say  this is sweater  and it 's just what i need to go with my new suit . thank you ever so much  .  
 oh  i see . how old is she  ?  
 today  .  
 hey  i still know my name  .  
 she said i have a fever but nothing major  .  
 about three years  .  
 she must be deaf  .  
 it must be a haunted house  .  are you frightened  ?  
 frightened  ?  you must be joking  .  
 okay  .  
 rin  ?  
 i got it  .  mary lin  .  
 really  ?  when did that happen  ?  
 a week ago  ?  they met last summer and now just sink  .  they will be married soon  .  
 oops  .  i meant   think  
 yes  he is  .  he loves the girl very much  .  
 pretty good  .  i 've made a few friends already  .  
 that 's what pam said  .  
 just do n't stay out too late  .  
 of course  .  
 ah  i  m going to the pub to watch the football  .  
 what  ?  
 i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely  .  
 what other important buildings are we going to see on fifth avenue  ?  
 well then  there 's a central park  .  facing the park on fifth avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world  .  
 he 's out of john's hands  .  nothing he can do about such a black sheep  .  
 you 'll have to try for yourself some day  .  
 with everything  with everybody  with all this  !  
 well  i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives  .  
 that 's great  !  
 well  i ddi n't think so at first  .  but as we started talking  i found him extremely funny and witty  .  i could n't stop laughing at his jokes  !  we have so much in common  .  we like the same teams  music  and most amazingly  we both love chinese food  !  i have the feeling that we are going to be great friends  .  
 she has promised her mother that she would be with him through thick and thin  .  
 you married him for that reason  ?  
 is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with  ?  
 it must have taught you a lesson this time  .  
 i 'm not sure . let me have a look  .  .  .  it could be a coffee grinder  .  
 yes  it must be used for grinding coffee beans  .  
 that  s right  .  but i don  t think there are better ways  .  
 i heard it might rain  .  
 yes that might be a better idea  .  
 maybe we  ll meet some of the artists too  .  
 no  you can  t suddenly make smoking illegal  but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres  .  
 you 're mary  right  ?  
 i think you 'd better apologize  .  
 you know  i often have to work till late at night  .  i need something to keep me awake  .  
 thanks  .  some tea would be nice  .  chinese tea is great  .  i really like your tea set  .  where did you get it  ?  
 then we 've got to get going  .  
 i  ve tried it  not a chance  .  
 or getting stuck in traffic jams when you  re driving  .  
 you have a phone on the bedside table that you can use  .  
 it 's got to be almost a year now  .  
 oh really  !  that sounds lovely  .  
 but i do n't know what to do  .  
 until college  ?  
 please do n't tell my mom  .  
 i 'm glad that you see it that way  .  
 well  .  yes  but those people always start talking to me  .  i never talk to them first  .  perhaps i 'm not as shy as i think  .  anyway  you 're certainly not shy  !  
 you should have kept trying  .  
 do you think the taxi driver will understand you  ?  
 i enjoy the various characters and the plot  .  
 if i have a chance  i 'll enjoy the book  .  
 it 's the best seller everyone 's been talking about for the last six months  .  
 i agree with you  .  
 it 's a very good game  .  
 but there is always somebody who wants to turn his back on the true history  .  
 no i didn  t  .  i worked in the morning then i played tennis with my husband  .  
 and you should n't miss the louvre museum  .  you can stay there for at least a whole day  .  
 oh yes  i  ve been to britain many times  .  i go there on business  .  
 right  .  the city life has made us tired and out of energy  while the natural world can bring us quite new feelings  .  
 i am on my way out to a new year  s banquet  .  how do i look  ?  is my makeup ok  ?  
 not much  just a house party with some friends  .  
 i  m sure you  ll have fun no matter where you go  .  remember to take your bag  .  
 sounds great  !  how many kinds of folk collections do they have  ?  
 well  .  there 're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city  .  that 's half the collections of antique objects in china  .  there 's one exhibition half for multiple collection  and several individual display rooms for private collectors  .  
 the port is quite exquisite  .  it must have spent years aging in barrels  .  am i right  ?  
 why not  ?  it sounds great  .  
 ok  here 's to your health  .  
 i am happy  .  i just bought a new car  .  
 it  s a great car  .  it  s very comfortable and it goes really fast  .  
 you 're back already  .  that sure was quick  .  
 big head  !  
 coffee  please  .  
 oh  that 's only a few days from now  !  how many weeks are you going to be taking  ?  
 august 1st  .  
 what would you do at the party  ?  
 look  !  there 's a folk concert tomorrow evening  .  do you want to go  ?  
 that  s all right  .  i understand  .  
 someone claimed it was one of the two manmade wonders that could be seen on the moon  .  
 thanks  .  
 i sure will  .  
 so you do n't travel a lot now  ?  
 yes  it 's really amazing  .  i got to go now  .  i 'm meeting with some other collectors  .  
 it  s so sad  .  they had been together for only two months  .  do you know what the matter was  ?  
 how so  ?  
 poor mary  !  she really liked him  .  
 but i always get tonguetied when i see her  .  
 the film will start at 2 
 good for you  !  it sounds like you 've done a lot of planning in a very short time  .  
 i guess you 're right  .  i can help you ask other hotels  .  i am sure there are probably some available  .  
 my pleasure  .  
 but why  ?  did i do anything wrong  ?  
 i have thought about it for a while  .  i think it  s time to move on for both of us  .  
 well  .  it  s not all my fault  anna  .  .  .  
 oh  it  s fine  .  i  ve got a very nice secretary and a large pleasant office  .  
 fair enough  .  give it to me straight  .  did she bully you into this  ?  
 i tell ya  when i got the invite  it really threw me for a loop  .  you 've done a complete 180  .  
 yeah  .  that 's just what is troubling john  .  
 it takes two to make a quarrel and it takes two to mend fences  .  
 last night he told the children acliffhangerstory and both of them were scared out of sleep  .  
 i bet he is  .  he domed his own life  .  
 but you are too slow to follow them  .  
 sure  .  i didn  t know you liked mysteries  .  
 where did you go to university  ?  
 i am a journalist  .  i write for china daily  .  
 did you know that you wanted to be a journalist right after your graduation  ?  
 mary said that she was really pleased with the photography  .  
 do n't worry  .  i 'm not much of a dancer myself  .  
 it 's hard to say  .  it depends  .  but i love the waltz  .  
 thank you for the dance  .  
 i 'm sorry  .  it was cruel of me  .  but i promise it will never happen again  ?  look  there 's a nice restaurant  .  let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over  .  
 you mean the boy you met on msn  ?  
 you should n't take it too seriously  .  it might be a lie  .  
 i  m very sorry i can  t  .  
 no  thanks  .  his home is not far and i can walk there  .  
 but promise me  you 'll keep it a secret  .  
 oh  i see  .  office romance tends to be the subject of gossip  .  
 worse still  he is trying to avoid me these days  .  
 many people like him get a flying start but soon disappear  .  
 but what do most people think about it  ?  
 yes  .  i have been here for three years  .  
 do you like this campus  ?  
 sure  thanks  .  
 he is more nice than wise  .  
 not bad  but she 's as busy as before  .  
 you see   .  this time i traveled to the west  .  when i looked out of the windows of the rain  all the lands that i could see are as dry as a bone  .  
 i suspect it 's unavoidable  .  
 do you really think so  ?  
 we did n't pay attention to the environment  cut down trees and polluted the air  .  
 yes i can  .  i speak it very well  .  
 you can take me to the bank if you want to  .  
 but mrs . smith hired him to find her lost son  .  
 yeah  .  he 's a private eye now  .  
 how about a snack after work  ?  
 why are you feeling depressed  ?  
 i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me  .  that  s a real letdown  .  
 oh  cheer up  .  a girlfriend is not everything  .  
 but she means a lot to me  .  
 good gracious  !  are you sure  ?  
 yes  she is  .  and guess what  he is her sixth husband  .  
 really  ?  i  m surprised  .  
 me too  .  
 you are kidding  !  he just broke up with ann  .  
 he 's a chicken guy  .  
 what a pity  !  
 are you also going to beijing  ?  
 yes  on a business trip  .  how about yuu  ?  
 maybe this is god 's will  .  
 so  you are leaving  are n't you  ?  
 how nice  !  i can see you are busying packing  .  i 'm sorry to interrupt you  .  
 jones can certainly take down letter more quickly  but mary  s short hand is the best in her class  .  
 how could you  ?  i reminded you just this morning  .  
 i 'm really sorry i let you down  .  i 'll make it up to you somehow  .  
 i  m worried about my daughter  .  she can  t decide about college  .  
 you are really a henpecked husband  .  
 it  s true  .  michelle is a lot like henry in so many ways  .  and she is shy with new people just like he is  .  
 because  .  .  .  oh  all right  .  you win  .  let  s pay for them and go  .  
 i ca n't think the same  .  
 if she has  they must be fairweather friends  .  
 she 'd better keep away from them  .  
 i do n't know  .  maybe they 're really crazy  .  
 so when did this all happen  ?  
 last weekend  while they were on their ski trip  .  
 how amazing  !  
 i suppose i do  .  
 this city is really comfortable to live in  .  
 maybe  .  
 i 'm not sure  .  medium i suppose  .  maybe a little on the heavy side  .  
 no  i do n't think so  .  
 i 've heard  .  she looks quite depressed  .  
 sally  ?  she is a bachelor girl  .  she is an excellent designer  .  many of the company 's advertisements are her child trains  .  
 why is she still single  ?  she must have a face that would stop a clock  .  
 which john  ?  mr . turnbow  s son  ?  
 good luck to them  .  
 goofed off  ?  maybe  but i 'm not a clockwatcher  .  i finished doing what i should do and then knock off an hour earlier  .  
 you are right  .  we should n't do anything under the table  .  
 how can you do so  ?  perhaps something is wrong with him  .  let  s go and see him  .  
 i  m afraid you  ll become angry  .  but i think i must tell you  .  
 why do you say so  ?  everyone admires that you have a good wife  .  
 oh  no  .  when we were poor  we often tried our best to make ends meet  .  it was a hard time  .  
 neither do i  .  let 's stay in a cabin . it ll be much nicer right beside the ocean  .  
 i 'm pretty sure i 'll be all right  .  in fact  i 'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you . what time are you planning to start  ?  
 that sounds fine  .  i 'll be there around seven  .  
 nice to meet you  i 'am simon  .  i do n't think i ve seen you around before  .  
 i ve beaning worked ibm for years  .  i am vested personnel file system  he is the after sale survise director  .  he such a nice boss  i like working for him  .  
 what 's that  ?  
 i fell on the way to school  and your bike got scratched  .  i 'm really sorry  .  
 it 's kind of you to say  .  i feel a little stupid  .  
 that is what tornadoes sound like  .  they sound like trains  .  they 're very loud  .  
 maybe  .  it depends on the tornado . some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour . that is very fast  .  others are n't so fast  .  
 yes  it 's me  .  
 not yet  .  i feel too lousy to go out . anyway  i have a flu  .  i know what it is  .  i do n't need a doctor to tell me that  .  
 i have a cell phone in my car  .  now it 's probably on the floor on the passenger side . why do n't you get it for me  and then i can call the police  ?  
 yes  maybe it does . but if you 're going to drive like you did just now  you will have to get used to a little physical pain  .  you know what i mean  ?  
 what 's that  ?  
 will it be a church wedding or a civil ceremony  ?  
 guess  !  
 sure  i 'll get it for you . books or magazines  ?  
 they usually do  .  
 yes . look  !  mary is going to throw the bride bouquet  .  
 then does it go well with my sweater  ?  
 we had the grass cut and the flowers trimmed this morning  .  
 coffee  please  .  
 here you are  .  
 yeah  we 're buddybuddy still  .  
 well  he is  but he can be conniving at times  .  
 come on you 're confusing me . give it to me straight  .  
 actually  he 's the most dependable person i know  and he would never turn on anyone  .  
 after going through an episode like that i 'm not surprised  .  how 's her headspace  ?  
 she does n't need to do that  i did n't do anything  .  
 yeah  i 've lost touch with most people as well  but i still see rose occasionally  .  
 have you taken your temperature  ?  
 better luck this time  .  
 here is a gift for you  .  i hope you like it  .  
 of course mike  .  who else  ?  we fell in love at first sight  .  
 you too . bye  .  
 i 'm happy to hear that  but publishing is more than just talking to writers  .  it involves a lot of work  patience and responsibility  .  most of the work is boring  .  
 no  i have no complaints  .  i hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company  .  is that true  ?  
 that 's perfect  .  i will definitely do well  .  
 in a cab you just pay what it says on the meter  .  i generally tip hotel porters 10 yuan per bag  but in firstclass hotels they 're instructed not to accept gratuities  .  
 thank you for your compliment . won t you try this fish with white sauce  ?  i 'm rather round of it  .  
 well  it 's getting late  .  i have to get up early tomorrow  .  so i must say good night  .  
 well . john had promised to be my date  but he stood me up  .  i waited for a full hour in the cold wind  .  
 miss  !  
 my name is jane brown  !  
 would you please be quiet  ladies and gentlemen  ?  
 at harvard  .  what about you  ?  
 oh  are you  ?  that sounds interesting  .  
 it 's a girl  .  
 when are you returning home  ?  
 but baby girls are just as good and just as fun as baby boys  .  
 hello  this is mark speaking  .  
 that 's wonderful  !  we 've got to celebrate  !  
 did you go to school here  ?  
 well  i went to high school here  but i went to college in texas  .  
 did you get a job right after graduation  ?  
 you really don  t need to  .  
 ok  .  i  ll miss you  .  i hope we can see each other again soon  .  
 i hope so  too  .  thank you  lily  .  thank you for everything  .  
 you  re welcome  .  
 how about next time we meet at my place  ?  and i  ll treat you to chinese food  .  i know how much you like it  .  we can order in and watch video too  .  anything you like  i promise  .  
 i was there between 88 and 90  .  
 i ca n't stand making decisions  .  you choose  !  
 ok  i wo n't keep you then  .  
 it  s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon  .  
 i hope so  too  .  bye  !  ben  .  
 thank you very much  !  
 wow  good for you . it sounds like a lot of work  .  i 'm proud of you  !  is this the right building  ?  
 thank you  .  wow  your school has so many honors  .  congratulations  !  
 that 's hard to say  .  .  .  i think ottawa is prettier . it has better sightseeing  too  .  a lot of museums and galleries  .  
 i beg your pardon  ?  
 really  ?  well  ok  you 're welcome  .  
 ok . then i 'll be expecting you  .  
 i 'll be there on time  .  
 i suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems  .  
 oh  i always have difficulty in getting along with the staff  .  
 just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do  make sure you do n't lose your temper  .  
 i think that 's a bad idea  .  i 'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . how would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want  ?  
 you are probably right  .  i 'll go right now and apologize  .  i try hard not to be late but it is difficult with beijing traffic  .  
 that 's good for me  but do you think you 'll be back by then  ?  i 'd really like to see you  .  
 yeah  i 'm expecting to come back on tuesday  .  
 not bad . thank you for your help  .  i am always busy with this job  i feel a bit tired  .  
 i also feel that work efficiency here is very high  .  and you have strong working ability and professional skill  it seems that you know all  that 's really wonderful  !  
 you know the phrase  the survival the fittest  .  we have no choices  .  
 my car run out of petrol  .  
 please go to see a doctor  .  
 would you like to go with me  ?  i  m afraid of the hospital  .  
 i saw him last week  .  it seems he was a bit queer in the head  .  
 because he stayed with me all the time that night  .  
 exactly  .  herry is almost broken now  .  
 i think it  s time for the government to take strong action  .  and people should try to protect environment  .  
 you tried to seduce me  .  i fell for you  .  
 no wonder  .  
 why  ?  
 when i went to see him yesterday  he looked rather pale  .  
 we all know that  .  her husband always make a fuss of her  .  
 lucky her  .  
 yeah  .  they simply had no extra money to save up or for other things  .  
 of course  he is a man with a history  .  
 that  s too bad  .  how are things now  ?  
 no problem  .  you know him  .  he  s the kind of guy that  s always willing to go the extra miles  .  
 ask john  .  he is sure to know about it  .  
 you know  he is a taxi driver  .  he has to have his eyes peeled all the time when he drives  especially during the rush hour  .  
 i think you  ll lay it to rest with the time flying  .  
 ok  .  
 oh  that  s too bad  .  why don  t you take some aspirin  ?  
 well  it  s necessary for you to see a doctor  .  
 i  d like to  .  but i  m afraid i can  t  .  
 or maybe make the beds  .  
 i agree with you in the sense  .  but we  re all more miserable than ever  aren  t we  ?  
 thanks  .  lovely day  .  pity i  m on duty  .  
 pardon  ?

 just fine  thank you . how s your father today  ?  
 he 's much better today  .  
 going for a walk in such a cold weather  ?  
 well  trains are frequent and come on time  .

 no no  i just changed my eating habits  .  i eat a balance meal  .  and i eat less than before  .  
 well  i swim and run every day  .  
 i am not surprised  you eat too much  .  
 actually you have n't had much  .  
 hey  do you know any mystery belief serve the festival  ?  
 such as  .  .  .  
 do n't you see many people over there  ?  just on your left  .  
 the house warming party  .  
 it 's out in the suburbs  .  
 yes  i have  .  i went out with them last weekend  .  
 all right  bill . here s your daily exercise schedule  .  you are to jog before breakfast  .  
 oh no  .  
 ok  you can stop now . it s time for the dance class  .  
 i 'll get my things and meet you there  .  
 no  i do n't like museums . they re boring  .  
 did you drive yourself to the airport  ?  
 exactly  .  
 oh  speaking of the conductor  he is indeed a genius . he did a perfect job . his name is menuhin  a descendent of russian american immigrants  .  
 yeah  .  you can say that again  .  it  s noisy too  .  
 if it 's any good  i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition  .  
 fine  thank you  .  and you  ?  
 you yourself have a photo studio  ?  
 yes  i like collecting things  .  
 yes  stones  .  
 well  yeah  but i 'd be getting somebody else 's problem  .  
 pretty bad  .  i  ve had a bad cold for three days and still can  t get rid of it  .  
 morning  mike  .  
 i  ve already got it  .  thanks  .  
 well  the weather is so unpredictable this time of year  .  
 yes  it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall  .  
 yes  .  
 yes  the weather sure is nice today  .  
 okay . hey  is that a dark cloud over there  ?  do you think it will rain after all  ?  
 he  s buying me a handbag  and then dinner at a gorgeous restaurant  .  
 good idea  betty  .  what would you think about the second part  ?  
 how come  ?  
 well  all tight  .  but you know  smoking does do harm to your health  .  
 you 're right  i 'll change it  .  how about the last part  ?  
 no  i 'm still single  .  
 then  you put s in this blank  .  
 do you get much rain during the summer  ?  
 that 's right  .  
 to tell you the truth  i 'm not married  .  i 'm still single  .  
 to be frank  i was married once  and now i 'm single  .  
 spring  .  
 that 's why you should go there  if you do n't dare to speak english owing to the fact that you are afraid of making mistakes  you simply will never learn english  .  
 when did you begin to smoke  ?  
 i 'm flying home on sunday afternoon  .  
 how about saturday morning  ?  
 sounds good  .  
 when do you leave  ?  
 i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train  .  
 you 'll recover after a good night 's sleep  .  
 well  i certainly could n't have done it without your help  .  you are the best tutor i 've ever had  .  
 no trouble at all  .  he 's very cute and brave  .  by the way  do remember to keep him away from sea food for at least two weeks  .  
 it 's not far away from home  it 's  let me see  about 20 minutes 'walk  can you walk here  ?  
 it 's too late to say sorry now . oh  what am i going to do  ?  
 excuse me  miss lin . would you mind speaking up  please  ?  i ca n't hear you very well  .  
 oh i remember  i cut terrible calls  and you did n't say anything about it  .  
 i  m sorry  .  i didn  t know that  .  
 you should take their advice  .  they know what 's best for you . but my friends will have jobs and lots of fun  while i spend all my time doing reading and writing  .  
 are you sure you can n't remember  ?  
 you  re almost 70 years old  mom  !  don  t you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us  ?  
 so  tell me  karl  why did you come all the way to minnesota to live  ?  
 and the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise  .  my father is over 60 years old  and he lifts weights every day  .  
 don  t say that  .  it looks like a dump now  .  i can  t stand it  .  
 yes  but you only pay 800 dollars a month  .  emm  it  s hard to decide which is better  shorter commuting time or lower rent  .  
 sounds like you better buy a bicycle  .  
 what are you reading  ?  
 no  not really  .  why do you ask  ?  
 it moved slowly up the stairs  step by step  and i could hear its approaching footsteps  .  when it finally got to the top of the stairs  i realized that it was my father in his green pajamas  .  he had gone to get a late night snack  .  
 it 's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future  .  
 hmm  hard to say  wait  yes  it looks like you will do well in business  and your ambition will help you a lot  but  .  .  .  
 well  some people use a standard set of words  but many couples today write their own wedding vows  .  
 oh  i did n't think of that  .  well  this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in china  .  plenty of food and drink  music and dancing  and interesting traditions  .  
 last weekend  while they were on the sik trip  .  
 i know  but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us  and without warning  .  
 that 's what i thought  .  it seems that he 's been seeing someone else for about two months  .  
 i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang  .  i picked it up and a girl asked to talk to mark  .  she then asked if i was his sister  and i said no  i was his wife  .  she hung up immediately  .  
 this city is really comfortable to living  .  
 well  if you live in other as long enough you love them just as much  .  
 i do n't believe it  .  
 and i score three of them  .  
 how can you be so sure  ?  
 i can tell form the way he spoke to us  .  
 oh  without doubt . when is the next class  ?  
 of course  easy . no sweat  .  
 but saturday is my birthday  .  
 my first grandchild  .  
 do you think so  ?  well  i guess  .  he does look a lot like me  .  oh  he  s got richard  s eyes though  .  
 congratulations on your success  .  
 he is fine  .  
 thank you  .  he  s very lucky indeed  .  
 i  m sure i will  .  
 oh  it  s lovely  .  think of the nasty weather we had last week  .  
 don  t you think it  s a bit cold for that  ?  
 then why don  t we go for a walk in the hills  .  it  d be very good for us you know  .  
 well  just a little thin  .  
 no  she  s average  .  
 what color is her hair  ?  
 saturday my parents are coming to town  .  what  s up  ?  
 we  re going fishing  .  
 she likes to golf  dance and eat foreign food  .  
 not where  what  .  dutch means you both pay your own way  .  
 well  french was my best subject at school  .  i can read and write it pretty well  .  
 where did you learn it  ?  
 well  it 's hard to say  .  i cough a lot in the evening  .  
 you 'd better give up smoking  .  it 's bad for your health  .  
 you know  i often have to work til late at night  .  i need something to keep me awake  .  
 not cash  .  but if our launch goes well  my stock options will pay off  big time  .  
 i might make nothing even if i stay  .  for that kind of risk  i want to get rich  .  
 most salespeople seem like halfbrains  .  zina 's definitely an exception  .  
 no way  .  i want the satisfaction of squishing this bug myself  .  plus  what if it 's vince  ?  
 and i travelled a little bit in australia  .  i went up the east coast  .  up to frasier island  .  which is a world heritage site  .  and i saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water  .  we climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the  .  .  .   which is a but north  .  and the further north you go in australia  the hotter it gets  .  so we were able to go swimming in the ocean and i went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause i did n't have a diving license  so i went on an introductory dive and i saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that i was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly  .  
 will you be going back to australia soon  ?  
 i 'd like to go and live there for at least another year  .  probably i 'll go back to sydney or maybe i 'll go down to melbourne because it 's a really interesting cultural city  .  they have lot of museums and parks  .  
 the biggest city  ?  the biggest city is sydney  then it 's followed by melbourne and then brisbane and then i think it 's perth  .  but most of the big cities are on the east coast of australia  .  and perth is on the west coast  but sort of of out there by itself  .  
 i like brisbane  .  i had my teenage years in brisbane  growing up in brisbane  um or maybe sidney because it is a big city  but brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine  .  
 what do you recommend  ?  what can i do to lose weight  ?  
 that 's pretty tough  !  
 not much  .  .  .  but that 's ok  .  .  .  i 'm a night owl anyway  .  
 as soon as you can get here  .  we 'll be waiting for you  .  
 you need to quit thinking like a loser  .  invoking is going to kick butt  .  you know how i know  ?  
 great  !  so  are you ready for a full day of shopping  ?  
 hmm  yeah  well this girl here at the back  that 's leaning on the door  um  she looks really bored  actually  .  maybe she is going to work or something and she does n't want to go  !  
 maybe  .  but i  d rather be spoiled than turn into a crazy guy with a long period to talk to the birds  .  
 that 's right  .  vince still stops by her office every day to thank her  .  
 yes  i  m afraid i am  .  my husband is a smoker too  .  
 you don  t mind if i smoke  do you  ?  
 sign  ?  what  s sign  ?  
 to tell you the truth  i 'm not married  .  i 'm still single  .  
 then  when do you plan to get married  ?  
 why  ?  
 stop producing cigarettes  .  
 you  re right  .  but you know it  s so hard to give up the old habit like smoking  .  
 you know i often have to work far into the night  .  i need smoking to keep me awake  .  
 my goodness  !  it  s the afternoon  ?  doesn  t the time fly  !  do come in and sit down  .  
 what  s the time  ?  my watch has stopped  .  
 what do you normally eat  ?  
 that  s a good idea  .  it must be easy to find a job in shanghai  .  
 and english is very useful in your job  .  
 well  that does sound nice  .  have they moved in yet  ?  
 they are moving today  .  tom 's taken the day off  .  he 's rented a truck  and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight  .  
 no  not at all  .  go ahead  .  
 yeah  this is my first visit here  .  
 can you speak any other languages  ?  
 good  .  
 do you mean you got a divorce  ?  
 it 's boring  right  ?  
 do you like the weather in seattle  ?  
 very well too  thank you very much . isn t it a lovely day  ?  
 mm  .  .  .  it 's quite warm now  .  
 in london . where do you live  ?  
 there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert  ?  
 fine  !  do you want anything to eat now  ?  
 i 'm fine too  thank you  .  
 not bad  .  
 sure . thank you very much  .  
 then i ll pick you up at six thirty . ok  ?  
 see you  .  
 yes  simple as it is  .  t does work  .  
 obviously you did enjoy the concert  .  
 yes  i did  .  
 well  do you think i have to  ?  
 are there any cities where it rains a lot  ?  
 have they set a date for the wedding  ?  
 what would you do at the party  ?  
 yes  actually  the song has been sung since its publication in 1932 . people all over the world have sung it in many different languages  .  
 are you going to have a birthday party  ?  
 my parents  .  
 about 6  .  
 mom  it 's orange  ?  
 wow  my son is so clever  .  
 sure  .  mom  i can take care of you  .  
 why  ?  
 ok  superman  .  put on your cape  we are going to fly home  .  
 frankly  he is more wellbehaved than you  .  
 let me see . yes  .  i will buy a plane for you  .  there is no traffic up there  .  
 i 'd love to do that  .  what do you recommend  ?  
 here is a free class going on right over there  .  go and join them  .  
 oh  i 've got an idea  .  why do n't you ask dad to go with you  ?  he badly needs some exercise  .  
 but he took some newspaper away without paying  .  
 why does he have such a privilege  ?  
 why are so many extra gifts left here  ?  
 that 's true  .  
 it is just pop song  you could have sung there too if you want it  .  
 honey  just do it next time  .  have you heard of the real art in the subway station in russia  ?  
 many oil painting exhibitions are there  .  that is a kind of museum exhibition  .  
 it 's a chance in a million  .  i hear john is interested in it  .  
 but anyway  i 'll have a try  .  
 he used to be a policeman  .  
 you are kidding  !  he just broke up with ann  .  
 i hope i will meet her soon  .  
 he is too scared to ask her  .  
 we 'd better leave him alone  .  
 i 've been snowed under with since my bosses away on business  .  
 i think i 'm getting a heart stroke  .  
 no  .  but now he will be in bigger trouble  !  what 's a boyfriend for  ?  forget about valentine 's day  ?  
 yeah  a lot of changes have happened here  .  
 it 's clive of course  .  where did you come from  ?  every girl knows clive  !  
 kobe is a good player but i heard he is a womanizer  .  
 do n't remind me of that  .  this would be the last time i cut any classes for a basketball game  .  
 it 's only seven minutes into the game  too early to cheer up  .  
 come on  18 points already  they are never gonna catch up  .  
 thay are coming back to narrow the gap  .  
 clive is ready to explode  .  keep your eyes open  .  
 stretching exercise after sitting a long time  .  
 hey  young man  !  i 'm your sis  .  do n't talk to me like that  .  
 oh  man  look at her  go  !  she is amazing  !  she should be my sis  .  
 yes  but you need to slow down  .  this is jogging  not racing  !  
 god  !  it 's freezing  !  
 be brave  .  do n't worry  .  you will be able to walk soon  .  
 i see  .  but is n't it a bit too noisy  ?  
 all right  .  would you make coffee yourself when you are at home  ?  
 exactly  .  nescafe is the world 's favorite coffee  .  people love it all over the world  ?  
 which country makes the best coffee in the world  ?  
 many people think brazil makes the best coffee  .  brazil exports a lot of coffee  .  but i love irish coffee  .  so it 's hard to say  .  just depends on your taste  .  
 yes  like a dolphin  .  am i on the right track  ?  
 of course  tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game  .  
 but i never saw them  .  
 since last time we 've climbed the mountain  we have n't gone out for a long time  .  
 and this kind of weather is rare for the season either  .  
 yeah  some places are very short of water  .  
 it is serious  .  
 are you sure of that  ?  
 really  ?  
 thank you  .  i will  .  
 yeah  .  
 where did you spend your holiday  ?  
 if i can do anything for you  do n't hesitate to let me know  .  
 she said that she didn  t want to foul her own nest  .  
 fair enough  .  give it to me straight  .  did she bully you into this  ?  
 i know  .  but things have changed  .  i guess i 've settled down  .  
 i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed  .  
 i guess so  .  so what do you do around this time of year  ?  
 why do you say that  ?  
 many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives  .  government service can be a rewarding and secure career  .  
 i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy  .  
 sometimes that 's true  but not usually  .  most feds are honest  hardworking professionals  .  it  s hard to keep highly trained people  so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive  .  
 then does that mean the other churches are corrupt  ?  
 that means that they all have parts of the original gospel  but not all  .  
 lend you a few bucks  ?  no way  !  still remember the money you borrowed me last time  ?  
 he must be regretting about having done the business  .  
 let me have a look  .  it 's mine  .  i have been looking for it  but just cannot find it  .  it 's present from my father  .  
 i see why it lags behind other towns  .  
 i  ve cut it upland come to the conclusion that hi is actually sick of jenny  s brother  .  but he likes jenny  .  she is a big apple in his eye  .  
 he ran four miles and came back dead beat  .  
 the government is making efforts to change situation  .  
 i remember you are in love  .  
 of course not  .  
 i think it is easy  .  i could work in your class with no problem  .  
 you want to bet  ?  
 yeah  what't the bet  ?  
 how do you find the prices there  ?  
 a good suggestion for you  .  you need a holiday  .  
 certainly  perhaps  .  
 yes  sunday sounds fine  .  what time  ?  
 come on  dear  .  i know you mustn  t forget it  .  
 what day is it on earth  ?  
 it is at 8 o 'clock  .  
 i think that she had a litter too much of the punch  .  
 very much  .  the birthday cake was delicious  wasn  t it  ?  emily told me that she and karen made it themselves  .  
 all cleaned up  .  are you ready to start on the washing up  ?  
 yes  that annoys me too  .  with billboards  you can look away  but with broadcasts  you can  t avoid them  .  i like the way that advertising agencies use comedy in their campaign  .  
 i wouldn  t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy  .  
 you  d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer  .  it  s not something you can just walk into  .  
 my uncle owns a farm and i  ve spent some time working with him  .  i love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields  .  
 i like those kinds of programs too  .  they  re very informative  .  i think that many people underrate the education value of tv  .  
 i just don  t find it very interesting  .  
 i think that for a lot of people  it  s just a way to try and show their country is better than other countries  .  
 yes  we won the men  s 110 metres hurdles  .  i watched that on tv  .  what other events did we win  ?  
 that  s great  .  those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition  .  they must be terribly disappointed if they don  t win  .  
 was he disqualified  ?  
 i love dogs  .  they have been used as guards for centuries  .  nowadays  they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers  .  
 i can ride too  .  perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend  ?  
 no  there aren  t  .  this map just show the geographical features  .  look at the himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world  .  
 rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand canyon  .  
 my country is well know for being very flat  .  there are some hills in the southeast of the country  .  
 is it really completely flat  ?  
 yes  there are  .  they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries  .  
 the coast of your country is very varied  .  the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches  .  
 no  it isn  t  .  it  s a pity  because i  d like to see it in action  .  
 there  s a real mix of stories in the book  .  i haven  t finished all of them yet  though  .  many of them are short detective stories  but there are also horror stories and scifi ones  .  if you give me your business card  i  ll make sure you get an advance copy to review  .  
 i  ve been to most of the countries in europe  several countries in asia  china  japan  korea  and thailand  and to the united states and canada  .  
 we need to talk about the size of the country and its population  .  
 ok  .  china is about the same size as canada and the united states and it has a population of about 1 . 3 billion  making it the latest country in the world by population  .  
 it says here that most of the people are han chinese  but there are 55 minorities that make up almost 10  of the population  .  
 we could divide into five parts  .  there  s the northeast  which is mild in summer and very cold in winter  .  then there is the northwest  which is largely desert  .  tillet is famous for its mountainous climate  .  the rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts  .  one is temperatemild in winter and warm in summer  .  then  in the south it is hot most of the year  .  
 did you have a layover  ?  
 pilgrimages are common in many faiths  .  
 i have had disagreement with every director  .  i  ve worked with  .  we  ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences  .  it was the same when i made this movie  .  i don  t know where rumours of my disagreement with rachel kelly come from  .  we got on very well and i hope to work with her again  .  i enjoyed making the movie very much  .  
 thank you very much for doing this interview  .  
 my pleasure  .  have you seen the movie yet  ?  
 yes  .  i have  .  i liked it very much  .  like you  i was very impressed with rachel  s performance in the movie  .  she  s going to be a star  .  
 he  s a famous american musician  .  
 it  s great  !  i  ve learned a lot from reading it  .  
 how many chapters does the book have  ?  
 there are 15 chapters in total  .  
 thanks  .  charlie  !  
 no problem  .  bob  .  
 he didn  t say it was bad  but he said that it wasn  t as good as it could have been  particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it  .  
 not really  .  i like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year  .  i hardly know anything about art or sculpture  .  you are a true art lover  aren  t you  ?  
 i like sculpture  especially that from ancient rome or greece  .  what time are you thinking of going  ?  i  d love to go with you  .  
 i thought i  d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards  .  does that sound ok to you  ?  bus 51 goes directly there  .  
 that sounds fine  .  what time shall we meet at the bus stop  ?  
 i also grew up in a big family  .  i have one older brother and three younger sisters  .  
 about seven years now  .  and you  ?  
  ha ha  i  ll keep that in mind  but don  t tell my husband  .  
 sure  .  let  s go  .  what are you going to have done  ?  
 i want to have a foot massage and haircut  .  
 this could become a very expensive trip to be beauty parlour  !  
 i think it  s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally  .  don  t you agree  ?  
 i see  .  i think i  d agree with that statement  .  people often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again  .  
 yes  she gets along with them quite well  .  
 of course  !  
 he  s 21  .  how old is james  ?  
 he  s fine  .  he retired last week  .  it  s turning going in his life  .  now he can relax and enjoy his retirement  .  
 oh  i don  t think he wants to  .  he wants to travel to several different countries around the world  .  
 how do you want to spend your old age  ?  
 do you think that teenagers get a lot of their bad behaviour from tv and movies  ?  
 pan american airlines  .  flight 282  .  
 no  i don  t really like it  .  it  s boring  .  
 does she go to night school  ?  
 she wants to be a manager  .  
 it  s really very good  .  
 not so well  .  i 've come down with the flu  .  
 yeah  .  how are you these days  ?  
 thank you  .  good evening  mr . dean  .  
 would you tell us your name  please  ?  
 quite well  thank you  .  
 is this where we 'll be holding the meeting  ?  
 you too  .  i hope to see you soon  .  goodbye  .  
 i think everyone will be coming  .  dave don  t come because he has to go to his parent  s home and they live in scotland  .  
 i hope you didn  t forget mine  !  
 that trend has already begun in my country  .  in particular  there  s a big demand for people to work in fitness centers  .  which kinds of jobs are less in demand  ?  
 that sounds great  !  have you eaten  ?  
 oh  right  .  i suppose so  .  as long as you promise to lose  !  
 in the last olympics  we did very well in swimming  cycling and ball sports  .  i think we  ll do well in those same events  .  
 two  .  french and spanish  .  
 yeah  you never look at the positive side of things  .  
 but i do n't even know what to study  .  
 but my friends will have jobs and lots of fun  while i spend all my time doing reading and writing  .  
 but if you go to university  you 'll still have time for fun  .  
 why do n't you go to bed and get up early  ?  you 'll have the same time for work  .  
 oh  he  s fine  .  kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays  .  
 no  they made him vicepresident in charge of sells  .  
 no  have they have another fight  ?  
 this is right  .  there is no doubt in my mind  .  
 yes  i do  .  i think that science is making us wiser  .  what do you think  ?  
 is that very likely in england  ?  
 i think the romans do what everyone else does  .  
 and roman really loves life  .  he knows how to enjoy himself  .  
 how can i go there to have a taste  ?  
 by air of course  .  
 you can take me to the bank if you want to  .  
 i  ve got a fever and really a bad headache  .  
 well  you  d better get some rest  .  
 bye  .  
 i like being able to buy newspapers and magazines at the post office  .  it means that i don  t need to go to two places 
 some restaurants allow you to take your own wine and just charge you corkage  but the don  t do that at  ginger  s   .  what was included in the seafood buffet  ?  
 no  i might have a soup if it  s a cold winter day  .  
 i can terminate my life insurance policy when i retire and use the money as a pension  .  
 i know what you mean  .  people would stare at you in amazement if you wore something like that in an everyday situation  .  i suppose only extravagant rich people wear them at cocktail parties  .  
 do you use your bank to pay your utility bills  ?  i use direct debit  .  
 yes  i do  .  it save me a lot of time  .  i also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines  .  
 that  s good idea  .  you don  t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that  .  i suppose you have a mortgage too  .  
 i wish i could be one of those people  but my budget simply doesn  t stretch that far  .  i have to limit the amount of money i spend on clothes otherwise i would go on a shopping frenzy  .  
 i look at myself in the mirror  .  sometimes  it  s not a pleasant sight  especially if i have been out late the late before  .  
 i shave every workday  but i only shave at weekends if i  m going out somewhere  .  if i  m staying at home  i don  t shave  .  
 my friend and her fiance had a really good idea  .  they have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook  .  the picture are of things they want  .  people sign their name by the item they will buy  .  
 most of the things were household appliance  .  you know  everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker  .  i think it  s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home  .  
 what did you argue about  ?  
 yes  but i got angry with him too quickly  .  he probably thought that i mistrusted him  .  i shouldn  t have got angry  .  
 if everyone turned up  it would be a squeeze  but a few people said that they couldn  t go  so i think it should be ok  ?  
 well  don  t be late  .  i  ll see you on friday at helen  s  .  
 you 're right  .  i love it very much  .  
 let 's enter it  !  
 no  .  i  m serious  .  i  m going to quit my job  .  
 well  i 've lost my wallet and my id card  .  
 it 's an easy way to get hurt  let me tell you  .  
 really  ?  that 's wonderful  !  
 cool  fellow  what 's the date today  buddy  ?  
 do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar  ?  
 brain locker  ?  no  i do n't think so  .  what does he look like  ?  
 yean  .  around five feet five inches tall  .  
 yes  i took off 4 kilos  .  i am glad you notice it  .  
 no no  i just changed my eating habits  .  i eat a balance meal  .  and i eat less than before  .  
 well  i swim and run every day  .  
 um  ?  
 no thanks  .  i have had enough  .  
 that sounds ridiculous  .  why  ?  
 that is just an excuse  .  you can always find some time to exercise  .  
 how about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night  ?  
 well  jim  .  it is a combination of how much you eat  the type of food you eat  and when you eat your meals  .  
 oh  i see them  .  some are doing taijiquan  some are performing swordplay  some are practising the chinese wushu  .  
 well  it pays off for her  .  how old is she anyway  ?  
 me too  .  i like the festival best of all  .  
 hey  do you know any mystery belief serve the festival  ?  
 why  ?  to welcome the new year of course  ?  
 and also to frighten away evil spirits  .  
 so romantic  .  young people must have lot of fun  .  
 no i am free  i will be there  what time the thing starting  ?  
 do n't worry  i will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty  .  
 got it  .  
 wow  all this for forty dollars per month  ?  
 wow  i didn  t know  !  probably because i flunked history in school  .  
 is that why you missed work today  ?  
 i was so dehydrated that i drank like a gallon of water  and my head has been pounding all day  .  i swear  i  m never gonna drink again  !  
 too bad man  tonight is tracy  s going away party and she asked if you were gonna go  .  
 i guess  .  
 well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon  !  
 oh no you didn  t  .  you didn  t just insult the salsbury seals  did you  ?  why don  t you just  .  just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over  ?  
 uh huh  .  .  .  
 this is very beautiful  .  though i have to confess  i don  t know the first thing about farming  !  
 oh  !  my grandmother used to say  raising pigs  raising kids  .  .  .  at least you can eat the pigs  .   
 how old is he  ?  
 i will  !  i could use some good luck  !  
 oooh  !  one for each of the zeros in 2000  !  wow  !  
 uh  just for fun  .  happy easter  mom  .  we got you these easter lilies  .  
 of course i 'm pale  .  it 's just now the beginning of spring  .  i do n't have my summer tan yet  .  
 and after church they come here for lunch  ?  
 the kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these  .  hide away  yijun  !  
 believe it  !  
 um  holly  ?  look behind you  .  they 're coming this way  .  
 no wonder you 're such a wacko  .  .  .  
 yes  it is  .  look at the little light  !  it blinks off and on  .  
 i would look so cool carrying this around  !  
 you 'll never guess what happened today  !  i went to the doctor after work and the doctor told me  .  .  .  
 but they 're just ads  .  .  .  
 but it 's so thin  .  there 's no way that it comes with a cdrom  .  
 your boyfriend  bryan  wanted to toss the football  .  i think he wore me out  .  
 yeah  you look a little shaky  .  and pale  .  you seriously need some time in the sun  .  
 we 're just worried about you  taylor  .  
 is that a kind of alcohol  ?  
 it 's a clear spirit we drink any time of the day  .  you will love it  !  
 sorry  .  this is a oneman job  .  i 've got the grill just how i like it  and i 've made up my own special sauce  .  
 no  it 's just that it 's a holiday  .  with everyone out partying  there 's a lot of drunk driving  .  
 hello  ?  is the real taylor in there  ?  
 they played ball at school  .  here we go  .  yijun  go out for a pass  !  
 ummmph  !  
 the touchdown lines are there and there  .  ok  let 's play  !  
 is that what people usually do on memorial day  ?  
 yes  something called  george w  .  bush  .   an hour later  all i see are pictures of george w  .  bush in women's clothes  .  
 ok  but they better tag lightly  !  
 you 're embarrassed  are n't you  ?  you gotta loosen up in little italy  .  the lady at the cafe will kiss you when you meet her  .  .  .  
 you 'll find some of those here  too  .  but not if you do n't shake it up  !  there 's an african saying   if you can talk  you can sing  !  if you can walk  you can dance  !   
 well  that seems easy enough  .  
 so you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next  ?  
 i was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed  !  then they are sold on the black market  .  
 why would that be funny  ?  
 well  i would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday  !  
 that seems reasonable  .  we should get together and watch the ball drop in times square  .  
 sure  as long as you do n't try to kiss me at midnight  !  
 really  !  let 's go back upstairs and get back to bed  .  that way  we can let santa do his job  .  then when you wake up  it will be christmas already  !  
 why  ?  i don  t want to have nail polish or anything like that  !  
 oh  hello  mr  .  campbell  .  i 'm fine and jack 's doing well  .  how are you  ?  
 good  well we can discuss this more then  but i think the figures are looking very good for this quarter  .  
 yes  me too  .  
 interesting  !  i am amazed how big and delicious thanksgiving dinners are  !  
 i don  t know  .  i didn  t really feel like going out  .  i guess i  m feeling a little homesick  .  
 i was  .  it  s just that the holidays are coming up and i won  t be able to home because i can  t afford the airfare  .  i  m just longing for some of the comforts of home  like my mom  s cooking and being around my family  .  
 well  sometimes i think of how things could have turned out if i had done things a little differently  .  
 you see  !  everything happens for a reason  !  we wouldn  t even have met if i hadn  t been in that car accident ten years ago  !  
 uh  .  .  .  yeah  !  i  ve told you a thousand times that i  m learning to play the drums  .  now that i know how to play well  i would like to form a rock band  .  
 i  m thinking of taking you back home  .  i thought we could have a nice evening  but you  re always so negative  .  
 well he  s more of a man than you are  at least he appreciates love stories  .  
 that  s just it  i  m not happy anymore  tim  .  it  s not you  it  s me  .  i know that i can be hard to deal with  and you are a great guy  !  you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for  !  
 so  what are you saying  ?  you  re breaking up with me because i  m perfect  ?  
 baby  come on  .  don  t do this to me  !  whatever it is  we can work it out  .  just give me another chance  !  i know that we can get through this  but we gotta stick together  !  don  t leave me  .  
 no  !  it is not considered to be a national holiday here in the us  but in other countries it is  .  
 well  as we say  the rest is history  .  .  .  
 yeah  yeah  but today  s lesson was all about the creation of the universe  .  
 it  s fine  .  i am actually from mexico  .  i was in china on a business trip  visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products  .  
 don  t get me wrong  !  it  s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas  !  
 i am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old u  .  s of a  although i have some colombian heritage  .  
 sure  honey  we  re talking now  aren  t we  ?  
 you know  i think you  re awesome  .  
 he  s doing well  .  we went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened  .  
 oh yes  .  she had a beautiful wedding in cozumel mexico and we all attended  .  
 same here  !  we will catch up soon  maybe over coffee  !  
 see you soon  !  bye  !  egg  .  .  .  i can  t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter  .  
 he  s really good looking  he  s quite tall  around 6  1   he  s in his early thirties  and he  s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes  .  .  .  
 that  s my brother  !  
 and you  re going to completely transform your eating habits  right  ?  
 but this time i  m going to stick to it  .  i really mean it  !  trust me  carol  i  m going to be a new man in one year  s time  !  
 don  t worry  shan always screws up free throws  .  
 you were right  !  he didn  t make the shot  !  
 actually  my office is right around the corner  .  
 don  t be mean  .  look here come the bridesmaids  !  their dresses look beautiful  !  
 that  s all you ever think about  food  !  oh  i think the bride  s coming now  !  she looks gorgeous  .  wait  what  s she doing  ?  where  s she going  ?  
 oh great  !  does this mean that the reception is canceled  ?  
 it 's still early  .  
 forget about it  .  
 much as i d like to  i am afraid i wont be free next week  i have a lot of work  .  
 it will be a rock and roll band probably  .  he  s a very good guitarist  .  
 nowadays  you can be a dj  .  you can mix dance music  .  you do n't need to be able to play music instrument or thing  .  
 thanks  .  that would be very helpful  .  
 ok  .  
 if you are free  maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party  .  it will be fun  you will get to know lots of people  .  
 great  have a good day  thanks again for the offer  .  
 i 'll be there on time  .  
 i have to exchange some money  .  
 you mean  if  they catch the murderer  .  i  m scared stiff about going into the city center at night  .  
 there must have been some good news in the newspaper  .  i can  t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited  .  
 may i know your name  please  ?  
 sure  .  that would be great  .  good luck  .  
 that  s very kind of you  .  but if i don  t go now i  ll miss the last bus  .  
 how about next time we meet at my place  ?  and i  ll treat you to chinese food  .  i know how much you like it  .  we can order in and watch video too  .  anything you like  i promise  .  
 good night then  .  
 i want to say goodbye  .  i  m leaving for america tomorrow  .  
 thank you  .  
 thank you  .  remember to look me up if you  re ever in washington  .  
 you  ll be a mathematician one day  .  
 oh  don  t go yet  .  let  s at least have one more  .  
 that would be great  !  actually  can i get your phone number  ella  ?  that  s assuming you don  t mind if i call you sometime  .  
 ok  got it  .  i  ll call you sometime next week  .  
 how was it  ?  
 great  !  it 's good to see you  .  goodbye  !  
 sure  !  it 's txybgmail . com  .  
 i think the government can afford it  .  besides  there are many advantages  .  homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address  .  they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement  .  
 everyone is looking at the issue in the short term  rather than the long term  .  it  s the same with the destruction of the rainforests  .  countries and companies just want the wood  .  they  re not thinking about the longterm damage to the forests  .  we should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life  .  
 i think i  d like to do that  .  i could take the things i learn here back to my country when i have finished my studies  .  
 summers are hot and usually lasts a long time  .  winters are short  but cold  wet  and windy  .  i love the summers in my city  but i hate the wintertime  .  
 what are spring and autumn like  ?  
 as you know  my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean  .  but people still go swimming all year around  .  i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning  .  
 i love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride  .  i love being out in the fresh summer air  .  how about you  ?  
 how many countries have been affected  ?  
 so far  less than 20 people have died  but over 100 are in hospital  .  
 there are a few in my country  .  we have deposit of gold  but they are very small  .  
 we have some inspections  but it is very hard to avoid pollution when extracting oil  .  there has been some damage  but it is under control  .  
 we import a little oil from venezuela  but we are fairly selfsufficient  .  we import some iron and a lot of aluminium from neighbouring countries  .  
 that  s unless there is a traffic jam  .  it could take three hours  .  
 more and more people like it now  .  fewer people play table tennis than before  .  many people like swimming  because it is fun and keeps you fit  .  
 yes  exactly  .  
 brazilian against ac millan  .  
 i bet ac milan will lose  .  
 thanksgiving day  independence day  .  
 i 'll stay at home and have a complete rest  .  
 could you please get me a takeaway  ?  i have some urgent work to finish  .  so i don  t have enough time to go out for lunch  .  
 i do n't believe ads . what s more  i 'm already in perfect health  .  
 congratulations  !  that 's really something beyond my imagination  .  
 are n't you tired  ?  
 well  of course i can  t miss it  .  which team are you for  ?  
 you 're right . make  up can only disguise my age  but exercise may delay it  .  
 i think i need a thorough checkup  .  
 so what  ?  
 wow  i like concerts  .  
 thank you  .  in fact  i am in a hurry  .  my wife is waiting for me at the parking lot  .  
 you moved to a new place  ?  
 yes  i have been busy emptying the packing boxes and cleaning up the mats  .  right now  it looks like a home  .  i would like to have a small celebration party  .  please do come  .  
 to thank you for helping me at work last week  .  if you would not have been so kind  i would not have been able to pick my parents from the airport  .  you really did me a big favor  .  thank you so much  .  
 sure  i have  .  will you join  ?  
 no  it will not be formal at all  .  it is a fun time  .  you will love the game show  .  please dress casually  .  usually there is an over abandon of drinks  so be careful with that  .  
 my name is paul . is mr . smith in  ?  
 it 's nice of you to invite us  .  
 good for you  .  today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world  .  
 no  thanks  .  i 've had more than enough . in fact  i must be running along  .  
 thank you  shall i open it now  ?  
 that is a good idea  i love it  .  what time do you think is convenient  ?  
 well  what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting  ?  
 thank you for your suggestion  .  
 in the front  please  .  
 sorry  i 've no idea  .  
 wow  you sound very professional  .  
 if you refuse to take risk  you can  t have better returns  .  
 sounds cool  !  but that is not what a lady should do  .  people are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk  .  
 i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you  .  
 sure he is  .  winter swimming does good to health  i hear  .  
 is the bus station close by  ?  
 yeah  it 's a block away down the street  .  
 how can you do that  ?  
 i will  .  see you later  .  
 yeah  my wife likes that one  too  .  personally  i prefer action movies  .  
 how about the yellow mountains  ?  
 do you need a hand with that  ?  
 do n't worry about it  .  
 thank you so much  .  you 're an expert  .  
 no  i think harry will get it  .  
 ok  loser buys pizza tomorrow night  .  
 he got a job and now he owns a small grocery in town  .  
 no  i am from south california  .  this is my first real winter  .  
 i came to see my aunt  .  
 yes  .  she lives on the next block  .  
 pretty well  .  i think the boss liked my ideas  .  
 great  so what happens now  ?  
 providence  rhode island  .  do you know it  ?  
 that ok  .  that 's happens all the time  .  
 well  i like to play the piano  .  
 that  s really interesting  you have to play for me some time  .  
 really good  !  you should try it sometime  .  
 me  ?  i prefer france  .  
 oh  really  ?  i went to china last winter  !  
 i agree  .  .  .  
 nothing that serious  .  she finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend  .  
 yes i do  usually  .  
 i do n't like spending time on commercials . there re too many commercials on tv  .  
 i think we picked the right line  .  this one seems to be moving more quickly than the others  .  
 i prefer a variety show without a host  .  
 yeah  everyday  .  and there  s only one choice . all the other buses are going the other direction  .  
 what does he look like  ?  can people tell  ?  
 of course  !  it 's the most wonderful natural works  .  
 maybe that 's true for some positions  but i think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree  .  they dress for success  !  you ca n't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans  .  it 's just not respectful to you client  .  
 it 's not as simple as that  .  people judge you by your appearance  whether you like it or not  .  so dressing professional is being professional  .  the image that you portray to others is so important in business  .  it 's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale  .  
 you 're right . he s a hard worker  easy to get along with  honest  and he never steals the credit on projects . the only thing he 's lacking in is experience  .  
 do you think the glass ceiling phenomena is because of traditional social customs  ?  or are there more issues coming into play  ?  
 yes it is  better than i expected it would be . the presenters have been first rate . is this the first conference you 've been to  ?  
 two  a boy and a girl . they  re already grown now  .  
 i manage one of the ski lodges . it s a great job  i can spend a lot of my time outdoors  and i also get to ski for free all season  .  
 wow  talk about job perks  !  that 's great  .  i would like to do something exciting like that . but i am only an accountant . not too much excitement there . huh  ?  
 that 's okay . if it were n't for you accountants  nobody would have the money to go skiing  !  
 management is n't looking on the labor unions too favorably  i 'd guess  .  i do n't blame them  .  .  .  labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives  .  
 they want raises and medical insurance  and i think they want to clean up the factory 's safety hazards  .  that 's probably the most important issue  .  
 are you planning on treating the investors to a fullcourse meal  ?  
 it happens quite often  actually . whenever there arises a dispute between the union and the executive group  the first thing they do is to call a strike  .  usually it only lasts a day or two before both sides can come to an agreement and we start work again  .  anyhow  it 's a nice  unanticipated holiday  .  .  .  
 it depends on the topic  the teacher  and the way the course is set up  .  yesterday  even though we only had a short time to discuss the issues  the workshop got us all thinking  .  we learned some very basic  but very useful methods of dealing with personnel issues  .  
 yeah  i guess you 're right  .  i think the trust game was my favorite  .  i think in order to have a strong team  we 've all got to learn how to trust each other more  .  
 you 're right  we do need leadership  .  but what we do n't need is too many people to lead us  .  you know what they say about too many chiefs and not enough indians  .  .  .  
 if they all unite on a certain issue  it 's the stockholders who have the final say  .  you 'd think it might be our ceo or the workers  but in fact  the stockholders control the money so they have the most power  .  
 it 's too difficult to park your car in the city  .  also  the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare  .  
 no kidding  !  when the last ceo left  we were worried about the future of the company  .  
 they are n't too familiar with doing business outside of japan  .  there are a lot of cultural differences to account for  .  
 how can you live without job in the future  ?  
 why can i learn it  ?  
 i  m looking forward to this film  .  i read a good review of it in this morning  s newspaper  .  
 how are your work now  ?  
 yes  but i don  t think it was enough  .  he looked disappointed  .  i gave him three dollars  .  
 i think that maybe chinese families are closer than your families  .  
 and what  s the problem  ?  
 and you want to know what to wear  ?  
 it was n't  .  it was birdseed  .  we do n't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it  .  
 oh  i am very sorry  hans  .  thank you for waiting for me  .  you must have been here a long time already  .  
 absolutely not  !  i refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on friday  !  
 that 's better  .  
 it should be  but there are too many options  .  my grades are good enough that i have a lot of choices  but after that  .  .  .  
 i see  .  well  do n't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school  .  he usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction . he gave me some information  and next week i 'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended  .  
 that  s cool  .  have you already found an apartment to live in  ?  
 i couldn  t even if i wanted to  .  my parents told me that if i went home  then  d have to find my own place  .  
 yeah  it sounds easy  .  how long does it take  ?  
 no  it  s easy  .  we  ll just take the shirt back to the men  s department and show them the sales slip  .  they  ll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund  .  
 yeah  but that 's what she did  .  
 ok  whatever  .  see  i 'm putting it in the garbage can  .  
 oh  i see  .  and can your family utilize 5 the health insurance  too  ?  
 congratulations  !  that  s wonderful  .  i bet both of you are quite happy  .  
 i agree  .  that  s why christopher is already looking for a job in maine  or wisconsin  .  
 i think the government fined him a small amount  and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts  .  he  s still a millionaire  .  
 wow  !  that  s great  .  i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals  but it  s difficult for me to keep up the exercise  .  also you know  old habits are hard to break  .  
 why  ?  you pay so much for such a tiny space to live  .  
 i can read the subtitles . my set is a hugescreen one  .  
 that 's more convenient  .  
 will you come to join us at dinner this evening  ?  my family will be happy to see you  .  and father misses you very much  .  
 i want to see all places of renown in suzhou  .  
 you  re almost 70 years old  mom  !  don  t you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us  ?  
 no way  !  i like my apartment  and i like to be independent  .  
 that  s not the end  .  they were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck  .  
 oh  really  ?  i go to the rye every day  .  
 i wish i had been there  !  
 yes  .  
 shall we go downtown for a movie this friday evening  ?  
 is your brother older or younger than you  ?  
 he is five years older than me  he got married last sunday . my brother and my sisterinlaw are the same age  .  
 by the way  my name is liu wei  .  
 jogging and bowling  .  do you know how to practise bungfu  ?  
 no i do n't but l do taijiquan or shadow boxing . people everywhere in china usually do taijiquan early in the morning . it can help people keep fit . it has a history of over three hundred years  .  
 thank you  .  i can teach you how to bowl  .  
 have you any definite idea  ?  
 i think you 'd better try an active job  .  
 oh  you may call him uncle  or henry  .  
 yes  a little breeze and a lovely moon  .  
 and it 's calm  .  i like the peace  .  
 marvelous idea  ?  
 so let 's get registered tomorrow  .  
 you look so lovely  .  
 i hope so  .  
 neither . the game ended in two all  .  
 but the brazilian is tougher  .  
 anyway  i dislike summer here . there s too much rainfall  .  
 what  s up  ?  
 let 's hope this stroke of good luck lasts  .  i hope we are over our financial difficulties for good  .  
 oh  great  !  i hope i can spend this spring festival with you here in beijing  .  
 do you mind if we watch it  .  i  d really like to see it  .  
 oh  i am sorry  .  what 's on channel 2 at 10 pm  ?  
 i did n't know you liked old movies  .  
 impossible  !  well  i 'm not giving up yet  .  it 's not over till the fat lady sings  !  
 yes  i do  .  the look of a picture is very important  .  
 i want a rematch  .  let 's play again  .  
 the godfather and the godfather ii  of course  .  they were both directed by francis ford coppola  .  
 well  did you know he was also the director of the terminator  ?  
 i 'll go by myself then  .  
 she 's not bad  .  she 's a bit bossy  but i 'm sure i 'll get used to her  .  
 have you ever thought about becoming a freelance it consultant  ?  
 yes  .  i 'm pretty outgoing and friendly  .  
 i 've sent my cv to dozens of companies but nobody has got back to me  .  
 did you write a clear objective in your resume  ?  
 thanks  i will  .  i 'll see you tomorrow then  !  
 if i get the promotion  i will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer  .  
 she 's pretty easy to get along with  .  she listens to her employees and treats everyone equally  .  
 you 're lucky  .  not everyone has such a great boss  !  
 that 's true  .  she 's highly esteemed among everyone at my company  .  
 i see what you mean  .  he  s really cute  .  how old is he  ?  
 just fine  karen  .  i  m just taking a breather from all this paper work  !  
 no  i do n't  .  
 if you want something manly  stick with the espresso  .  
 yep  !  and take it with me anywhere  !  and the music is free  !  
 how high did the price go  ?  
 i do n't know  .  i dropped out at  250  .  
 you know all about coffee  .  i need your advice  so i wo n't look stupid when i order  .  
 if you want to be macho  order a double shot of espresso  .  
 snipers  ?  
 sniping is when someone makes a bid at the very last minute to steal something for a bargain price  .  
 count me out  .  i can do without shills and snipers and turbobidders  .  
 they 're awesome  !  i was browsing through the ebay auction today  and i found the cutest fat little copper buddha  !  it 's over a hundred years old  .  
 why not  ?  
 if you did  you probably got ripped off  .  
 you might make a few enemies this way  .  
 yeah  .  but it 's fun  .  look at those two ugly old ladies  .  .  .  or are they men  ?  
 this watch is supposed to be worn on your left hand  .  
 it 's a camera  .  
 if i were on as many steroids as he was  i think i  d be powerful  too  .  
 what are you talking about  ?   !  he  s passed every drug test he  s taken  !  
 i 'll take it too  .  
 thank you and take care  .  
 he has a fever  .  
 so you 're quite happy with your new job  ?  
 they do n't have toilets at the campground  ?  
 yeah  and every high school student in town is banging on your door  right  ?  
 yeah  are you surprised  ?  
 not at all  !  that explains everything  !  
 hello  !  we 're supposed to be getting back to nature  .  
 but it is unjust to judge a book by its cover  .  if they  re not happy or comfortable with their clothes  they can be less productive  .  
 no  it will not be formal at all  .  it is a fun time  .  you will love the game show  .  please dress casually  .  usually there is an over abandon of drinks  so be careful with that  .  
 yes  please do  .  
 to thank you for helping me at work last week  .  if you would not have been so kind  i would not have been able to pick my parents from the airport  .  you really did me a big favor  .  thank you so much  .  
 fine  i know a good hotpot place in the downtown area  food there is pretty spicy too  .  shall we try that one  ?  
 thank you for inviting me  .  sounds lovely  !  i would like to come  .  where is your new apartment  ?  
 have you thought about it seriously  ?  
 ok  did you find a new company  ?  
 that is true  .  some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way  .  for example  it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people  .  to show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off  .  
 actually  i  m interested in all of them  .  the more choices we have  the harder to make a decision  .  
 i wouldn  t be able to make it without your help  .  
 what  s wrong with climate  ?  anyway  i think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before  .  can  t people do something to stop it  ?  
 working at weekend is something i hate to do most  .  
 i think it is good if we know enough about career planning  .  we will make wiser choices  .  what else did he tell you about it  ?  
 how regular  ?  
 cool  !  
 no wonder you 're such a wacko  .  .  .  
 that 's madame psychic to you  .  
 i 'm waiting  .  .  .  
 what was your childhood like  ?  
 what is your current occupation  ?  
 whatever you choose  make sure they are neat and clean  .  
 first of all  they have an excellent benefits package for all employees  even the maintenance staff have health and dental coverage  .  
 let me guess  from sarah  .  it looks like something she would drive  .  
 you guessed right  .  besides  the color violet is a little girly for me  .  
 logan  !  why on earth are you hiding here  ?  white hat  !  come on  !  do n't tell me you 're the guy  !  it ca n't be true  .  
 with susan leaving  we should probably look to someone new on board  .  
 yep  .  and it breathes  see  !  
 yes  it is  .  look at the little light  !  it blinks off and on  .  
 i would look so cool carrying this around  !  
 if the new girl is competent  maybe they will promote her when that time comes  .  
 i don  t know  .  i think i did well in the paper exams  .  i was prepared to answer a lot of questions  but they didn  t ask those as i expected  .  to my surprise  the manager tried to talk about the chinese poesy with me  .  
 that  s what you get for working in a maledominated field  .  i think you  ll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way  .  you probably won  t be able to change him  .  
 thanks  .  let  s go for a celebration this evening  .  are you free  ?  
 really  ?  are you sure  ?  
 yeah but  it is something that you will have forever  !  they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment  .  on top of all that  i have heard it hurts a lot  !  
 then our entire job could be done by telecommuting  .  
 do you import any food items  ?  
 generally speaking  food items are difficult to import  .  food with the short shelf life is liable to spoil in the time it takes to ship from one place to another  .  the only food items we import are specialty canned or preserved foods  .  the shelf life is longer for these products  .  
 anything worth doing takes work  .  money does n't grow on trees  .  .  .  most of us have to work for it  .  
 because whoever let the cat out of the bag was breaking client confidentiality  .  
 do you often go home  ?  
 no  thanks all the same  .  
 thank you very much  .  we really had a good time  .  
 well  .  thank you for coming  .  
 you are right  .  i am not boasting  but she is really as beautiful as she is intelligent  .  
 i will  .  
 i really wanted to watch the star wars on the opening day  but the presale tickets were sold out  .  how did you manage to get hold of them  ?  
 a friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of pepsi  which is a major sponsor of the movie  .  he was able to get the tickets for free  and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece  .  
 wow  !  i am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake  .  i really appreciate that  .  so  what time are we going  ?  
 all right . that  s very nice of you  .  
 pretty good  !  how are your parents these days  ?  
 oh  they are fine  .  they are enjoying their retirement  .  
 where did you go there  .  
 this is my first  i only met jane last week  .  she and i teach at the same school  .  
 nice to meet you  i 'm jim taylor  .  
 who  s that  ?  
 sure  .  but i still liked it  .  
 no  .  although motorcycle is nice  i  d like to buy a bicycle  .  
 but why  ?  since you like it so much  .  
 if i have time  i will come again  .  
 well  as a matter of fact  i 've got a lunch date with bob thomas  .  
 really  ?  he looks so young  .  
 i 'm planing to go bolling tonight . tomorrow i was hoping to see a movie . what about you  ?  
 how about the new bar across road  ?  
 great  !  work is really busy now  but it 's fun  .  
 sure  here you go  .  
 yeah  i think so  .  oh  by the way  i need to ask you something  .  
 could i get back the sweater you borrowed  ?  
 you know  just giving me lots to do  .  i 'm really busy right now  .  
 why not  .  if i were you  i certainly would  .  
 as the saying goes  work value work  play value play  .  all work and no play make a juckydull boy  you know  .  
 that  s should be fun  .  
 well  yes  .  there are something wrong actually  .  perhaps you can give me some advice  .  
 oh dear  .  what a pity  .  are you sure you lost your wallet in theatre  ?  
 oh  i  m afraid i can  t  .  i  ve had a date already  .  
 well  you 'd better get some more warm clothes  .  
 no  just bring yourself  .  i hope to see you there  .  
 he was also assassinated because of his views  .  
 that 's the spirit  .  never give up on your dream  .  
 that 's shortsighted  .  by the time the workers are experienced and contributing  .  they are likely to go  .  
 i understand that  but you 'd feel better if you took a break  even for just a short while  .  
 do i  ?  oh  no  .  
 you too  .  oh  i forgot to tell you one thing  .  a girl called this afternoon  .  she said she was your exgirlfriend  .  she wanted you to call her back  .  
 did she mention anything else  ?  
 it 's certainly a tight schedule  .  
 at what time  ?  
 pretty well  .  i think the boss liked my ideas  .  
 and how do you like working for ibm  ?  
 it  s challenging  i feel i have learned a lot  .  
 so  wily  you have been with ibm for two years ready for change  ?  
 i 'm sorry  i did n't quite catch that  .  
 noirin  noirin  it 's an irish name  .  
 good  .  i was thinking that i  d like to invite you to watch a movie  .  i can meet you at the cinema gate  .  
 six thirty  tonight  .  
 he is five years older than me  he got married last sunday . my brother and my sisterinlaw are the same age  .  
 by the way  my name is liu wei  .  
 i come from china . are you american  ?  
 certainly not . here it is  .  
 thanks a lot 
 thank you very much  by the way  is it quite expensive to take a taxi  ?  
 i 'll be please to if i can  .  what can i do for you  ?  
 yes  i 've got the address  .  
 which kind of food do you like  chinese food  western food or sea food  ?  
 hi  jason  !  long time no see  .  how 's the hotel  ?  
 so soon  !  well  i 'd really like to see you again before you leave  .  would you like to go out with me on friday  ?  i 'd like to take you to dinner and maybe a movie or something afterwards  .  
 luckily not . the silent i meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss  .  
 nothing  .  i am just asking  .  
 no  .  why  ?  
 that 's a big question  .  well  if you are in love  maybe you  ll take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all  .  
 yeah  .  i got sick and tired of her nagging all the time  .  
 yeah  it 's must for me  .  
 i wo n't  mom  .  
 new york times is better  ?  
 do you think the music is wellmatched  ?  
 yes  i think so  .  it 's very emotional  .  
 certainly it is  .  it 's worth an academy award  .  
 why  ?  
 yes  and would you like to have seats in the front or at the back  ?  
 in the front  please  .  
 can we get tickets now  ?  
 yeah  !  it reminds me of the previous star wars scenes  .  
 let me have a look  .  everything i do i do it for you  unchained melody  my heart will go on  .  oh  and i  d like to try everything i do i do it for you  .  
 is it easy to locate it  ?  
 seven thirty  .  there is only 10 minutes left and look at the long line  !  
 it 's very thoughtful of you  .  wow  it is so beautiful  .  could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas  ?  
 do you want to add some baby  s breath for that  ?  they are equally popular now  .  
 of course  .  can i have it delivered to my girlfriend 's house this afternoon  ?  
 thank you  .  same to you  .  
 my roommate  s having a party  .  
 is she coming  ?  
 oh  they are playing the wedding march  .  here they come  .  
 i am so happy for them  .  
 wow  is n't that dangerous  ?  
 tell me about it  .  
 500 feet  !  i would never be able to do that  .  
 you can say that  .  
 there were six of us  .  
 really  ?  me too  .  
 i guess you can  t do anything until after dark then  .  
 i met him through a computer bulletin board  .  
 i knew there would be a shower  but i did n't realize it would rain cats and dogs today  .  
 let 's hear the weather report later  .  what 's the weather like in your hometown  ?  
 neither too cold  nor too hot  .  
 that 's quite a lovely weather  .  
 my car did n't want to start either at first  .  
 does it ever get that cold on here  ?  
 it feels like ten degrees below zero at least  .  i do n't mind the cold weather but i do hate it when it gets slippery  .  
 i would n't say that  .  it looks fine to me  .  
 you  re darn right  .  i am out of style  .  so what what 's the point of keeping yourself in style 
 why not  ?  why ca n't we go back to the way things were  ?  
 yes  certainly  .  i know her mother and father  and brother and sisters  too  .  
 that sounds terrific  .  
 what  s wrong  ?  i want a break from this horrible job  .  
 then  buy a bottle of soft drink  .  
 and i  m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn  t truly worthy  .  
 i feel exactly the same way with you  .  
 i know  i know  .  well  is there some  is there someone else  ?  oh  that woman on television  sydney ann  .  
 neither am i  .  it 's just that the bestlooking girls are in that club  .  
 oh  come on  .  that 's no reason to do something you 're not interested in  .  
 wasn  t it cold on wednesday  ?  
 it  s so nice and quiet in the woods  .  
 yes  .  and he used to play the piano with a jazz group at the university  .  
 yes  he  s a millionaire in houston now  .  
 oh  no  .  he  s an executive for a large computer company  .  i saw an interview with him on tv yesterday  .  they were asking his opinion about future uses for computers  .  
 that  s not true  .  dark angel is a good show  .  
 do you like my carpet  ?  be honest  !  tell me what you really think  .  
 that sounds like fun  .  
 why  that 's very kind of you  mrs  .  johnson  .  i 'm sure my wife will be glad to  .  
 the people don  t really work out there  .  they just stand around and talk all the time  .  
 yeah  is your club different  ?  
 yeah  they have all the machines  a pool  and a steam room and sauna  .  
 sounds nice  .  what about classes  ?  
 the rockets  .  
 all right  see you later  .  
 yes  .  it 's perfect  .  
 i could n't have asked for more  .  
 i really ca n't say  .  both teams this year seem really good  .  
 maybe you 're right  .  but i just still ca n't understand  .  .  .  
 five and a half years  .  we moved here on the first of november  .  
 i know  but i 'm really hot  .  
 cheers  !

 i 'll be sure to do that  .  
 that 's more like it  .  
 yes  .  i needed a large one  .  before  i had a separate refrigerator and freezer  but this has both combined into one  .  
 it 's so faraway  .  
 i 'm number seven  .  what about you  ?  
 hah hah  !  you have to go before me  .  
 oh  you are too conservative  .  it 's just realistic  .  
 people think it 's funny  .  
 it 's a good way to save money  .  
 saving money  ?  how much money can you save by those 1 or 2 dollar discount coupons  ?  
 eight to twelve in the morning  two to six in the afternoon  .  
 no  it  s last year  s model  .

 i trust you  re keeping well  ?  
 well  we  ve already done our part  .  
 maybe not  .  dust is no longer a big problem in beijing  .  
 why is that  ?  
 i see  .  the fall in beijing is really beautiful  .  
 you got it  .  oh  by the way  it may be really cool in the evening around this time of the year  .  do n't forget to put on more clothes  or you might catch a cold  .  
 thanks for reminding me  .  
 but you  re crazy about him  ?  
 yes  i am  .  
 i  m afraid that  s not my cup of tea  .  i just find skindiving attracting  .  
 welcome to beijing  .  this is my business card  .  i 'm an engineer  .  if you need any help in beijing  just give me a call  .  
 oh yes  that was the best job in most farm families  .  that 's where many of them learned to play the flute  .  
 so he became a selftaught man  ?

 ok  i  ll sing san francisco then  .

 oh  yes  it is  .  thank you  .  i was looking for it just now  .  
 have you  ?  
 just two blocks away  in that tall building  .  
 no  i  m going to the airport to meet some friends from beijing  .  
 luckily that was nothing serious  .  
 are you crazy  ?  
 seventysix  i think  .  
 well  tell me  .  how was the labor and delivery  ?  
 i wouldn  t say that i had the time of my life but at least everything went without a hitch  .  
 don  t hold your breath  !  
 i  d love to  but you know i  ve got another appointment  .  i  m really sorry  .  
 easy  .  it  s on me  .  
 oh shame  !  i have a class tomorrow  .  
 well  it  s not like that  .  we just email  it  s really nothing  .  on top of which i am definitely thinking about stopping because it  s getting  .  .  .  
 parker  .  
 barker  ?  with a b  .  of course  .  
 that  s too bad  .  i  m sorry to hear that  .  
 do n't bother  .  those are a dime a dozen where we are going  .  
 i 'm sorry  sir  .  this is not a full service gas station  .  i will help you fill the gas  but we do n't wash windows here  .  
 that  s correct  .  it  s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in florida several years ago  .  the main characterthe police invesigatoris based on the man who investigated the case  .  
 how do you research your books  ?  
 there  s a real mix of stories in the book  .  i haven  t finished all of them yet  though  .  many of them are short detective stories  but there are also horror stories and scifi ones  .  if you give me your 
 thanks very much  .  i  m sure it will sell well  .  i can  t wait to read it  .  here  s my card  .  thank you for you time  .  
 i think you  re right about that  .  i  d need a good manager to be my spokesperson  .  i could do a lot of charity work  which would help a lot of people  .  
 i bet they love it really  .  sure  they complain about it  but that just gets them more publicity  doesn  t it  ?  
 i think you should give them some credit  .  they  re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn  .  they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves 
 i 'm really looking forward to reading your column  .  
 art isn  t for everyone  .  i  m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery  .  it  s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture  .  
 i 've never really thought about it before  .  i guess it does n't bother me  .  
 i actually try to avoid namebrand items  .  i ca n't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place  !  
 i know that advertisers are experts at persuading people to spend their money  i think brilliant items are usually higher quality than  grounds  .  
 to each their own  !  
 that 's the one  .  it 's an actioncomedy  .  what do you think  ?  
 one glass of red wine coming up  !  
 that 's too bad . they re such good company  .  
 your future husband  !  
 it gets better on sunday  though  .  the storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night  .  it will still be rather cool  with highs in the low 50s  .  the west coast will be experiencing some 
 yep  .  the steaks and chicken are marinated and i also bought hamburger buns  .  
 we should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs  .  
 sure  !  how about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches  ?  
 yeah right  !  i  m serious  !  you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well  .  you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup  !  it  s really not healthy  !  
 what  ?  why do we have to do that  ?  
 that  s bogus  .  i do n't feel any stress at work  and my love life is practically nonexistent  .  this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense  .  
 i have no idea what you  re talking about  .  the only sporting event we watch at home is the super bowl  .  
 all i know about soccer is that you can  t use your hands and that players are always falling down  trying to get a free kick or penalty kick  .  it seems like a sissy sport to me  !  
 whatever  i  m going to go watch the opening match  .  
 yes  .  .  .  
 i hope it will stay fine tomorrow  .  i 'm going to have a picnic with my family  .  
 any rain  ?  
 very well  thanks  .  nice to see you again  .  i have n't seen you for a long time  .  what have you been doing lately  ?  
 oh  nothing much really  .  and how is everything with you  ?  
 what have you been doing  ?  
 really  ?  good luck for them  .  
 goodbye  .  see you again sometime  .  
 what is that  ?  a jellyfish  ?  jeremy  put that down right now  !  it could sting you  !  
 when do you leave  ?  
 i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train  .  
 i 'm sorry to hear it  .  what 's wrong with her  ?  
 you need a babysitter  .  
 yes  i 'd ask jill  the girl i 've had before  but i need someone overnight . maybe even for two nights  .  
 why not  ?  
 great  .  then call me and let me know if she 's free  .  
 i do n't know  .  
 okay  .  check you later  .  
 whoa  that  s a lot of cash  !  let  s go to the course and see how tiger woods is doing  .  
 really  ?  in new berlin  ?  
 and the second stage is called a  tornado warning   .  
 what do you mean  a loud train   ?  
 that is what tornadoes sound like  .  they sound like trains  .  they 're very loud  .  
 aw  come on  it was nothing  .  i 'm just doing my job  .  
 that  s it  my lease is up  .  i have to move  .  
 what  ?  why  ?  can  t you renew it  ?  
 i think i might move in with my parents for a couple of months until i can find something  .  you know how hard it is to find a decent place around here  .  i  m gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while  .  
 well  i don  t want to be ripped like you  !  i just want a good physique with weights and carpio  .  
 got it  !  wow is that the weight you are lifting  ?  my goodness that  s a lot of weight  !  
 we have a guy who plays guitar  and another who plays bass . although we still haven  t found anyone to be our singer  .  you told me that you had some musical talent  right  ?  
 great  !  wait here  ?  you don  t have enough room for the amplifiers  microphones or even your drums  !  by the way where do you keep them or practice  ?  
 what do you mean  ?  
 for example  ?  
 good  because my friend wendy is getting married and i  m organizing her party  !  
 duh  !  i would say yes  !  eric is the most popular kid in school  !  okay  my turn  .  what would you do if you won the lottery  ?  
 my dad will freak out if i even mention a trip like that  !  
 alright this is a good one  .  what would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married  ?  
 and these two  ?  they are husband and wife  ?  
 i wanted to  but i ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block  !  i was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place  .  
 i  m awesome  .  well  i guess that  s my answer  isn  t it  .  
 oh baby  i  m so sorry  .  
 thank you dick  .  today we are going to talk about the movie lion king  .  tell me dave  what is your impression of this film  ?  
 how can it be cliche  ?  it  s a fable  !  it  s telling a timehonoured story  !  the movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption  and teaches children the value of respect  life and love  .  
 it  s fine  .  i am actually from mexico  .  i was in china on a business trip  visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products  .  
 i am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old u  .  s of a  although i have some colombian heritage  .  
 what  s the weather looking like today  kenny  ?  
 xu spikes it  !  wow  what a great hit  !  the brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in  !  
 brazil calls for a time out and we  ll be right back  after a short commercial break  .  
 jennifer  there  s something i wanna ask you  .  
 what is that they 're doing on the couch  ?  
 wait for me a minute  .  i 'll go over to the gym too  .  
 it sounds like a good plan to me  .  i 'm still  .  .  .  i mean  .  .  .  
 i 'm still just surprised you really want to do it . it does n't seem to go with your character  .  
 listen  ryan . catholics welcome people who are n't catholics to visit the church . you do n't have to pretend to be catholic  .  it 's okay if you just come to listen  .  
 yes  .  and he is the president of the company  .  
 any time  .  if you have a good idea  do n't be afraid to speak up . this is a company that appreciates initiative  .  
 no  i do n't think so  .  
 yes  .  why not  ?  
 no  it is n't strange at all . many people from taiwan move to america too  you know . do you think it is strange for them  ?  
 no  .  well  i do n't know . but taiwan is so crowded  .  do n't you miss life in america  ?  
 did mr  .  lin put you in charge of marketing  ?  
 well  i hope it all works out  john  .  i think if you 're part of the team  things will go well . but you know we 'd all miss you here  .  so i wo n't say i 'm happy to think that you 're leaving  .  
 that 's very nice of you to say . but if we set up an office there in the states  maybe you could try to become part of it  .  
 alright  .  see ya  !  
 yes  honey  .  .  .  
 yes  i 'm not really scared  .  maybe only a little  .  
 do n't believe what you see on tv  .  you will have a good time in new york . what things do you want to see  ?  
 relax  it was just a goat  !  
 you know what  ?  i don  t think i can hack it here out in the countryside  .  i  m going back to the city  !  
 we work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary  .  
 what  s the point  ?  we always make a new year  s resolution and by february we will have forgotten about it  .  it  s pointless  .  
 let  s think this through  .  first of all  you cannot leave amy at the altar  .  not only will she be humiliated and kill you  but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams  !  why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this  ?  second of all  you are just getting cold feet  .  you know deep down inside that you want to marry her  so cut the crap and do it  !  
 great  !  phew  !  that was a close one  !  you had me going there for a minute i thought i was gonna have to slap some sense into you  .  
 come on . we  ve been through this already  !  look  i know the adjustment was hard when you first got here  but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it  .  
 not at all  !  it be fun  !  it will be like a boys  night out  .  .  .  well kinda  .  .  .  
 you  re in america now  my british friend  .  we just call it football  .  
 i  m standing in front of an exquisite work of art  !  
 what  s the big deal  ?  it  s just a picture of some woman  .  
 it was a great idea to spend a day watching a game  .  
 well  you should come this weekend  .  i think you could do the climb  .  
 that must have been wonderful  .  do anything interesting  ?  
 sure  !  let  s have some nachos and mozzarella sticks  .  
 it  s so hot at lunchtime  i  d rather run in the morning  .  
 i have no idea  .  it was completely out of the blue  .  
 okay  now you really have to fill me in  .  what  s he like  ?  
 of course i miss grandma  too  .  i bet she  s gonna teach me how to play mahjong  !  hey  dad  are you going to buy me firecrackers this year  ?  we  re going to have the best fireworks  !  i  m really looking forward to lighting them  !  
 no  fireworks are awesome  !  
 oh  and i can  t wait to watch the dragon dance  !  dad  can i sit on your shoulders this time  ?  
 okay  .  .  .  end of the first quarter  .  .  .  alright  i  m gonna make a beer run  .  
 perfect  !  
 me too . you look so beautiful tonight  !  i wish this night would never end . there  s something i have to tell you  .  .  .  
 i  ve heard this one before  .  
 don  t be mean  .  look here come the bridesmaids  !  their dresses look beautiful  !  
 oh  no  !  i  m so sorry  !  are you all right  ?  
 oh  wait a second  you seem really familiar  i think i know you from somewhere  .  
 whatis tomorrow night something special  ?  
 the new bar is all techno music on friday night . you really want to dance to that  ?  
 it 's not all techno music  .  it 's not a special techno night  .  
 it 's fine with me if we go to the latin club  .  i like latin music . the only thing i never want to do again is listen to country rock . what was that bar called  ?  
 it 's true  .  i would never go there again either . country music is a nightmare  .  so is it the latin club  ?  
 maybe  .  
 oh  i did n't actually teach in the schools  .  i taught after school  .  i taught in english institutes  .  
 hmm  .  that sounds pretty oppressive for the kids  .  do n't they ever relax  ?  
 i do n't know  .  in costa rica  i taught adults . so it was a very different thing  .  so i really ca n't compare  .  
 i 've heard about enrail passes . so those europeans really depend on trains a lot  .  
 i know  .  our train system is lousy . and besides  americans love their cars too much  .  
 i agree  .  and probably the automobile companies are too powerful . they never allowed the government to develop trains  .  
 maybe you 're right  .  they will have to develop alternative transportation . but it will be hard in america  .  too many people are used to cars . even in our movies cars are very important  .  
 do you want me to give you a ride  ?  
 well  i hate the noise in the city  but i love being around lost of people  .  the problem is that you can  t have lots of people and have peace and quiet  .  the tow just don  t go together  .  
 well  i  d certainly come and visit you  .  it would be great to take a working holiday on a farm  .  i  d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while  .  
 is the traffic bad in the city centre  ?  
 i see  .  are there any building more than 200 years old in your city  ?  
 sure  .  a ufo is just a space vehicle from another planet  .  if you think about it  our space shuttles are ufos  .  
 need a new  .  girlfriend  huh  ?  
 ok  catch you later  .  
 it gives me a lot of pressure and i feel depressed  .  
 on second thought  i think i 'll join you  .  
 sure is  .  waiter  bring us two drafts  please  .  
 yes  we called  but it is booked up  .  the only choice is the regent beijing but we have n't made up our minds yet  .  
 i guess you 're right  .  i can help you ask other hotels  .  i am sure there are probably some available  .  
 are you doing anything this weekend  ?  
 you 'll just need roughly  10 for food and gas money  .  my friend is driving  so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money  .  
 even those  .  it 'll be very romantic  i think  .  you 'll have loads of fun  .  
 i think we  ll be better off if we are apart  .  
 i heard they were just married for 5 months  .  
 yeah  .  we chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners  .  
 i do n't know about that  but i do think that it helps people relax  .  
 what other kind of music do you listen to  ?  
 yes  it 's one of my hobbies  .  
 this is a very nice place  .  how long have you been living here now  ?  
 i 've got white wine  red wine  gin and tonics  ginger ale  lemonade  orange juice  and sprite  .  
 so how many people are coming for the dinner tonight  ?  
 well  if you can wait until tomorrow night  i 'll go with you then  .  
 sorry  i 've got people coming over tomorrow night  .  
 sounds that way  .  maybe some other time then  ?  
 i see how that can get a bit annoying  .  
 what would you do if you were me  ?  
 i 'd call it one of my hobbies  .  do you know much about photography  ?  
 yes . in fact  maybe we could go together  .  
 sounds great  .  see you then  .  
 were n't you scared  ?  
 i think so  .  after i jumped out of the plane  i realized that i should just enjoy life  .  worrying about it or not doing things out of fear is just plain silly  .  
 so  you 're into 80s music then  ?  
 i usually go to see a live band about twice a month  .  what about you  ?  
 i love going to live gigs  .  are there any good local bands playing around here that you 'd recommend  ?  
 let me know if you hear about any good bands playing on the weekends  .  i have more free time then  .  
 no  not at all  .  which one would you likethe new york times or the guardian  ?  
 his excuse was familiar  .  he said his car died again  .  
 where are you from  ?  
 i can imagine  .  
 i believe it  .  hoo  this car corners like it 's on rails  .  
 exercised over and over  .  exercise is a key  .  
 this is no laughing matter  nick  .  
 well  talk to him  and let me know what happens  ok  ?  
 just kidding  mikel  .  why do n't you come work out with me  ?  
 well  that 's not for me  .  
 it was n't as good as you think  .  
 well  i have to drive to school for a meeting this morning  and i 'm going to end up getting stuck in rushhour traffic  .  
 is there anything else bothering you  ?  
 that 's really cool  !  i 've always dreamed of going somewhere like tibet  seeing something unique  .  
 nothing particular  .  
 oh  tibet sounds great  but i 'm afraid it 'll cost too much  .  last time i traveled to india  and it cost me a fortune  .  
 i do n't really have time to learn anything new  .  i need to spend my time studying  !  
 to be honest  i was just dumped  .  
 ok  .  then i can make up my mind  .  
 yes  .  how about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass  ?  
 great  let 's go  !  
 yeah  i think so  .  
 ok  .  i 'll make the arrangements  .  it will be great  .  
 well  i did n't think so at first  .  but as we started talking  i found his extremely funny and witty  .  i could n't stop laughing at his jokes  !  we have so much in common  .  we like the same teams  music  a 
 good idea  !  i 've always been interested in that  .  how much is the entrance fee  ?  
 i believe most of them think of it as good public relations  .  they can promote their product and make their company betterknown  .  
 by the way  how long does it take  ?  
 that 's nice  .  having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage  eh  ?  
 good luck  !  
 art galleries  cathedrals  statues  fountains  palaces  bistros  there 's really too much to say  .  
 yes  at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun  .  however  on the third day of traveling in the city  i felt sick  .  i think i had something bad to eat  but it passed by the evening  .  
 that is great  .  everyone says french food is wonderful  .  
 how many gigs of music can it hold  ?  
 that 's one of the problems with having an ipod  .  though an ipod might have an above average battery life  once the battery is dead  so is your ipod  .  
 sure  .  i 'd like to see the smallest camcorder that you have first  .  
 how about night vision  ?  can you use it in the dark  ?  
 how does that compare with other models  ?  
 in that case  you need to turn on your airport  .  
 well  you can always block them  .  when i do n't feel like talking to certain people online  that 's what i do  .  
 do n't mention it  .  
 sure  .  here you go  .  
 do you want to listen to your messages first  ?  
 no  it 's ok  .  check your email first  i 'll check my unbox later  .  
 if you get the promotion  what will your new title be  ?  
 i could really use a 5  rise  .  
 that sounds reasonable  .  how about this  from now on  you can be responsible for scheduling  .  that means that if you ca n't find someone to cover a shift  then you 'll have to do it  .  
 no  of course not  .  go ahead  .  
 i went to a small school in connecticut  .  it has a very good reputation for its languages department  .  
 oh  did you study a foreign language  ?  
 it is  but it 's very rewarding  .  
 you are really happy and able to achieve high scores at school  .  
 oh yeah  i saw the tea house the other day  .  i think i might go and have a look sometime  .  it 's a nice neighborhood here  .  
 to be honest  i would n't  .  
 yes  .  it seems she can never accept a childless marriage  .  we had a fight last night  .  
 definitely  .  
 i think tv is a great waste of time  so i would only have one small tv in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning  .  
 no problem  .  
 yes  .  it was so crowded  .  i 'm wornout  .  let 's find our seats  .  
 yes  i went there once last summer  .  
 do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent  ?  
 how long is your contract for  ?  
 maybe you should invite her over for dinner  so it 's just the two of you  .  
 it 's ok  .  it seems we have a lot in common  .  
 come on  mary  you 're a total catch  .  i bet he will call you  .  do n't worry  .  
 thank you  steve  .  you 're always so encouraging  .  
 yes  .  i hope it pans out  .  cross your fingers  lily  .  
 please do n't be so fussy  !  i did n't just meet him yesterday  .  
 yes  i am the guy  .  
 let me explain  .  i did n't mean to hurt you  .  .  .  
 yes  .  he said i 'm his dream girl  .  
 how do you know so much about food and dieting  ?  
 how about your tongue  ?  does it still hurt  ?  
 i scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago  .  
 zach  what 's that on your arm  ?  
 sure  .  have you got anywhere in mind  ?  
 that depends  .  what is it  ?  
 of course  .  is the dinner still on  ?  
 i wish it was n't  but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here  .  
 nothing else has happened to me  but i have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close  .  
 and he looks like a typical jog  .  
 ahha  i thought so  .  
 my dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quite village in england  .  
 just how am i supposed to do that  ?  
 my aunts studied in the american universities . they say that extensive reading for fun is the most effective way to improve your english . that s what they learn here in america  .  
 you bet it  !  
 my grandpa  .  he has the final word about almost everything  .  my grandpa is  president   and grandma is  vicepresident  .   my parents  uncles and aunts try to arrive at a consensus on important questions  .  
 it is good to have goals in life  .  if california does n't work out  come and visit me in korea  ok  ?  
 can i help you pack  ?  
 we must go to a dance soon  or we 'll forget how to dance  .  
 oh  i did n't watch the football match  .  i wanted to but my wife preferred to see the old film  .  
 i 'm going to the english class . it ll start in five minutes  i 've got to run  .  
 ok  next time you  re here  .  
 sounds great  !  
 that sounds great  !  i  ll take you up on that invitation  .  
 at first  i 'll write about my life there  .  like interesting things on the campus  travel stories  special english words that i come across  .  sometimes  i 'll post my pictures on my blog so my family an 
 sure  since i came back from the us  i 've been keeping the habit of blogging  simply to share my personal insights on any topic i like  .  
 ca n't bear it  right  ?  i 've been there before  .  i 'll feel comfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages  like there is something missing  .  
 now i can tell you 're definitely addicted to the overflow of information  .  
 does jim make a lot of money  ?  
 jim likes to travel around the world . that s expensive  !  so he tries to make a lot of money  .  
 why  ?  
 look at the girls in the street  .  they all have bunch of flowers . is it valentine 's day  ?  
 i know  .  however  jazz always annoys me  .  i really do n't enjoy music in a movie  .  
 he 's coming by car on the twentyfourth  .  he 's staying from thetwentyfourth to the twentysixth  .  
 mother  i do n't remember the girls  .  how old are they  ?  
 because the houses look so nice at christmas time  .  
 yes  we are  .  we can neither play football nor do our homework today  .  
 no  but i can learn  .  what are you going to do this summer  ?  
 well  so long  mary  .  have fun  .  
 awhat  ?  
 kobe bryant  of course  .  
 he is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers  but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand  .  
 indeed  no man can be perfect  .  he is just soso in crashing the boards  .  usually he plays shooting guard  .  rebounding might not be his strong suit  .  
 who would n't  !  my friend lee went so far as to get an autograph from him  .  
 i only want it for the kitchen  .  i like to listen to the news at breakfast time  .  
 he appeals to the fans thanks to two things 
 certainly not  .  what really counts is to play as a team  passing the ball amongst each other  dodging defenders  .  free kicks are a result of all the teammates collective efforts  .  however  a few free k 
 yeah  .  .  .  it seems what we have on tv now are either repeats  or commercials  or lowquality shows  .  there 's really nothing to watch  .  
 cool  .  
 yeah  .  
 really  ?  what 's the series about  ?  
 as far as you could see  is dining at a chinese table a distinct experience  ?  to what extent does it differ from that in your homeland  ?  
 it will be a rock and roll band probably  .  he  s a very good guitarist  .  
 i wish i could play a musical instrument  .  i love music  .  
 so do i  .  i don  t like cats  .  
 i can  t bear being near cats  .  they don  t seem to like me either  .  
 your parents will be choosing your girlfriend if you aren  t careful  !  why don  t you try being more decisive  ?  start with some basic ones  .  when your friends are discussing which restaurant to eat at  mak 
 you have to be realistic  .  not everyone is going to agree with you  but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion  .  
 how might you spend the weekend  .  
 you  re right  .  by the way  did you hear that tom inherited some money recently  ?  
 i  m very pleased with their performances  .  timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds  .  that  s very fast for a kid his age  .  
 he  s not very good at the long jump though  is he  ?  
 it seems that they really enjoy to go faster  higher and further  .  
 well  i nearly always get up at dawn  .  i don  t like sleeping in late  .  the days are longer in summer that in winter  so i get up in summer  .  i usually do some exercise when i get up  .  
 that  s right  .  that  s one reason why it  s so important to protect every species  .  
 most people like football  .  more boys like football than girls  .  a few girls play it really well  .  some people like playing basketball  .  
 in my country  many people enjoy golf  but it is too expensive for some people  .  a few people like extreme sports  but i think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them  .  
 i think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment  .  
 the european union has sent several plants with relief supplies  .  several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies  .  refugee camps have been set up across the region  .  
 so did i  .  that 's why i did n't take my umbrella  .  i got cold in the rain in the afternoon . it was raining cats and dogs  .  
 do you usually go on a summer holiday  ?  
 in other parts of the world  especially in africa  there is a problem with desertification  .  climate change and overfarming are causing farmland to turn into desert  .  in means that people cannot grow e 
 yes  .  i like wearing shorts in summer  .  my legs would freeze  !  
 they  re people i met during the trip  .  that  s the ship we traveled on  .  
 yes  i have  .  
 yes  i have  .  i was there in april  .  
 paris in the spring  eh  ?  
 it was spring  but the weather was awful  .  it rained all the time  .  
 conrad reeves  the actor  ?  it can  t be  .  let me have another look  .  i think you  re right  !  isn  t he her third husband  ?  
 what 's the climate like in your country  ?  
 your secretary seems to think she is being harassed  .  
 i wish i were  but i am deadly serious  .  she said you invited her to dinner last week  .  
 not really  .  besides  there is a separate dress code for casual day  .  people ca n't just wear whatever they want  .  
 it seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity  .  
 what 's the climate like in your country  ?  
 what 's the weather like in spring  ?  
 what 's it like in summer  ?  
 is it cold or warm in autumn  ?  
 it may be cheaper  but it takes a long time  .  
 no  not yet  .  he 's still here  .  he 's going to move tomorrow  .  
 he 's a very nice person  .  we will all miss him  .  
 i don  t want a mink coat  !  i want to see the world  .  
 but mine equals yours in economy  .  
 what do you mean by on the whole  .  
 yeah  i agree . every wall has two sides  .  
 really  nothing big  .  i just heard about your ideas on employee motivation and i wanted chat with you about a few things going on in my department  .  
 well  i 'm afraid not  .  i think the hero has much more to be believed in  .  
 i do n't think so . it s impossible to equate wealth and happiness  .  
 could i understand what you said as the poorest is the happiest  ?  
 yeah  we were classmates when i was in university  .  
 no trouble  .  i enjoyed helping you  .  
 i am afraid not  .  i have no interest in them at all  .  
 don  t chicken out  !  come on  !  
 yeah  .  how are you these days  ?  
 unfortunately  i missed a chance to see a classic movie  .  
 that depends  .  what does she look like  ?  
 what 's the tattoo on her foot like  ?  
 what 's her personality like  ?  
 she 's a lot like me  .  
 romantic  ?  i am afraid i like thrillers better  .  
 do n't you think it 's too bloody  ?  
 it 's instructive and inspiring  .  
 does it enjoy popularity among the young generation  ?  
 they 're both very well  thanks  .  
 don  t sweat it  .  we will land safely  .  
 thank you  lisa  .  
 here is a present for you  .  i hope you like it  .  
 any rain  ?  
 we can pig out on potato chips and cookies  .  they are very cheap  .  
 right  drink as much as you can  .  
 you really like brains that make you think  do n't you  ?  
 does n't everyone  ?  which games are those  ?  
 do you still like playing those games  ?  
 sure  many times  .  it 's an exciting game for spectators to watch  .  
 i 've never really understood the game  .  
 not for a while  but we could watch an old one on the internet so i can explain the game to you  .  
 what happened  ?  
 me  too  !  do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place  ?  i 'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together  .  
 thanks  !  we love it  .  
 that must have been horrible  .  did you go out at all that day to see what was going on  ?  
 did they mention that in the article  ?  
 i agree  .  so many celebrities waste their money on sports cars  expensive clothing  and luxurious hotels  .  
 they 're also one of the richest couples  .  they have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want  .  
 i would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you  .  
 on top of that  there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs  which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city  .  
 i know what you mean  .  however  there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming  .  if it 's not the pollution  then it 's the natural disasters  deforestation  or the greenhouse 
 homeless youth can easily become involved with drugs and prostitution  .  do you do anything to help them  ?  
 they are  .  the reason why they did n't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards  .  
 which one is that  ?  
 it 's almost exactly the same  .  i think it 's a hilarious show  .  
 actually  the woman playing ophelia is a past classmate of mine  .  
 that 's only part of it  .  i absolutely adore this director  .  every play he works on turns out great  .  
 where are you from  ?  
 religious people blame it on premarital sex  not on abortion being illegal  .  
 i know this is going to sound sexist  but i do n't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children  .  
 that 's easy  .  everyone knows that there are nice  .  
 i hope not  .  i think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on earth  .  
 all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty  .  
 you have to give them credit  though  .  it 's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking  .  
 who 's the director  ?

 you know what  ?  you and i had no plans  so i made plans with mark  .  what 's the problem  ?  
 want to go see a movie tonight  ?

 0h  good  .  i have a long day and it 's good to get here  .  
 good  .  i think i 'll hire one for 7 days  .  
 yeah  you should have  .  it was really exciting  .  
 the score was 10198  .  
 i 'll make sure and make it to the next one  .  
 i was unable to make it  .  
 our team was victorious  .  
 it was a great game  .  
 i wanted to go  but i could n't  .  
 so tell me the final score  .  
 i would love it if it was n't always so unpredictable  .  
 it 's the middle of summer  it should n't rain today  .  
 that would be weird  .  
 yeah  especially since it 's ninety degrees outside  .  
 me too  .  i ca n't wait until winter  .  
 i 've been trying to call you all day  .  
 you 're talking to her  .  
 did you need something  ?  
 you 're right  .  i think it 's going to rain later  .  
 i know  you 're absolutely right  .  
 it would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather  .  
 i wish it was a nicer day today  .  
 it would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather  .  
 i got a promotion at my job  .  
 thank you very much  that 's kind of you  .  
 it 's the truth  .  i am really happy  .  
 i think that i might  .  
 nobody told me  .  
 wow  how exciting  .  
 heard what  ?  
 deborah already had her baby  .  
 is that shrimp in the soup  ?  
 mine are the same way  .  it seems like they 've been overcooked  .  
 who taught you how to cook this well  ?  
 i took a cooking class at the culinary institute  .  
 yes  there is shrimp in there along with sea vegetables and lemon grass  .  
 i appreciate you bringing the wine  .  it goes well with the chicken  .  
 good  .  i 'll just stay here until you get back  .  
 so the total is  36 . 00 for our dinner  .  
 my first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip  .  
 mine are n't so good  either  .  
 thank you  .  i just got this outfit the other day  .  
 i think i know who you 're talking about  .  
 i think that a tip of  3 . 60 will be the right amount to leave  .  
 seriously  it looks really nice on you  .  where did you buy it from  ?  
 those are great  .  how much were they  ?  
 your shoes look really nice  .  how much did you get them for  ?  
 i 'm going to go get a pair for myself  .  
 i have n't seen her yet  .  
 i think that she is very pretty  .  
 what height is she  ?  
 of course  .  did you  ?  
 no  i have n't  .  why  ?  
 no  i think i 'm going to go to the movies  .  
 what 's stopping you then  ?  
 yeah  but i 'm still waiting for my invitation  .  
 no  i did n't feel like it  .  
 thanks  sir  .  you too  .  drive safely  i hear there  s a lot ice on the roads  .  
 i  m fine  thanks  .  just trying to get adjusted  .  it  s hard to keep track of everything around here  .  
 this waitress has really been on top of things  has n't she  ?  
 no  i 'm good  .  all we need now is our check  .  
 let 's take a look at our bill  .  the total price for our dinner is  36 . 00  .  
 it absolutely was a great meal  .  we 'll have to return here for lunch sometime  .  
 yeah  why not  ?  i  ve got a little free time on my hands  .  where do you want to eat  ?  
 great  thanks  .  what  s up  ?  
 yes  the service was quite good  .  
 so  let 's look at the check  .  the total is  36 . 00  .  
 usually people leave 15   but this was exceptional service  .  i am thinking that maybe 20  would be appropriate  .  
 ok  so that will bring her tip to  7 . 20  .  add it to the  36 . 00 and the total is  43 . 20  .  
 i can eat my bacon and eggs while you are exchanging my pancakes for waffles  .  
 that would take care of it  thank you  .  
 of course  i will tell her  .  
 i would really prefer an outside table  .  would that be possible  ?  
 that 's ok  .  i will eat my eggs and bacon  and you can take my pancakes back  .  
 i would appreciate that  .  
 thank you  .  the last name is foster  .  
 can you tell me what night you will be coming  ?  
 we will be coming to your restaurant on tuesday night  .  
 we need to have them there at 11 
 okaybye  !  have a nice christmas  .  
 ok  we could look at that  .  
 what do you think the problem was  ?  
 i do n't think that the service was good  either  .  
 would you like to return to this restaurant  ?  
 i really liked it  !  
 it is a new restaurant  .  i do n't think they have their act together yet  .  
 i felt that the food was pretty mediocre  .  
 i 'd like to cancel a reservation  .  
 may i have your name and phone number  please  ?  
 hello  i would like a room please  .  
 all right  .  we have quite a selection for you to choose from  .  there are double rooms with twin beds  suites  if you 'd like  we have presidential suite on the top floor  .

 how about the next one  ?  
 thank you  .  will you be paying in cash or by credit card  ?

 of course  .  what room are you in  sir  ?  
 i 'm in room 215  .  
 what attracts you most  ?

 well  you have to let your flu run its course  .  you must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest  .  usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery  .

 it 's important to do proper exercises  .  
 i 've heard that  .  does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit  ?  
 that makes sense  .  probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper  .  
 you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise  .  
 no way  .  alisan darling just got hitched in vagas  .  
 grm 789051

 three  doctor  .  
 how many plates of ice ream did you eat  young man  ?  
 and you do n't feel any pain anywhere else  ?  in you legs  for example  ?  
 let  s have a look  .  mmmm  .  this doesn  t look too good  .  i think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth  .  it  s pressing against your molars and that  s one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain 
 first we will take some xrays and see what we  re dealing with  .  i also noticed a small cavity up front here  so you are going to need a filling  .  
 do you know what the problem is  ?  
 have you had it a long time  ?  
 i can do a chest xray to check for congestion  .  
 the blood test is for cholesterol  white blood cell count  and blood sugar  .

 i sprained my wrist  but the doctor says it will be fine  .  
 i haven  t ever tried that  but it sounds like a good idea  .

 i  ve been under stress  but no more than usual  .  
 have you been getting enough sleep lately  ?  
 yes  i would like to schedule an appointment for you to come in and talk with me  .

 i want to see you right away  .  
 i know for sure that something is wrong  !  
 can i sit down now  ?  
 it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills  .  
 alright  .  i 'm sorry  miss  .  according to our file  this prescription has already been refilled twice  .  
 well  it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription  .  
 a prescription must be valid  .  it cannot be an expired prescription  .  i 'm sorry  miss  .  it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you  .  
 miss  i just ca n't help you on this  .  i 'm a pharmacist  not a doctor  .  and there are other customers i need to help now  .  i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it  .  i 'm sorry  .

 now  let me have a look at you  .  i  d like to listen to your chest  .  breathe then  deep breath  that  s it  .  cough  now again  .  i want to exam your throat too  .  open wide  say a  .  
 did you lose any weight  ?  
 yes  .  i  ve lost quite a few pounds since last month  .  
 the pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic  .  
 james taylor  23  march 301982  .  
 health insurance company and policy no  ?  
 about two months  .  i did n't pay much attention to it in the beginning  but you see  i got fired this morning  .  i dozed off while we were having an important meeting  right in front of the boss  .  i was very embarrassed  .  
 the first problem is supposed to be solved after the investigation  .  about the second problem  i admit it 's our fault  so we will exchange all merchandise that falls short of our sample  .  
 your starting salary is 3  000 yuan a month  but if you work well we will put you on our regular staff after six months time and your salary will be raised to 5000 yuan a month  .  
 can i mail the book if it is a large file  ?  
 you can divide it into several documents to mail  .  or you can download the mentioned software from the warning  .  
 mr  .  richard  this is henry  .  i was interviewed by you last tuesday  .  
 we hope to make a decision in the next few days  .  we 'll notify you of our decision by mail  is this convenient for you  ?  
 yes  of course  .  what is it  ?  
 i 've worked here for two years  .  and i want to do something different  .  
 that 's terrible  .  
 well  i lost my grandpa when i was only ten  .  i often recall the period when he fed me  .  
 well done  !  another question  !  when will you start work  if you are hired  ?  
 let me see  .  it 's  800 per set cif london  .  
 usually the commission is three percent of the net invoice amount after deduction of discounts  .  
 well  .  i have nearly forgotten  .  mr green from abc company had an appointment with me  but i will be very busy at that time  .  if he calls  you can tell him the appointment will be changed to next week  .  
 twenty prints and five plain  .  that makes 5000 rolls in all  .  
 six weeks  did you say  ?  
 we could manage the plain rolls in six weeks  .  the prints might be put off to eight weeks  .  
 that might be acceptable  .  i shall have to cable our beijing office to get their approval  .  you can definitely supply in the time you 've given me  i suppose  .  
 yes  i 'll see that you get those delivery  .  shipping by s  .  s  .  american as usual  is that all right  ?  
 that 's right  .  
 good  .  can we ask you to put a country of origin mark on each container  ?  
 sure  no problem  .  as i said  cartons are good enough for goods like this  .  you do n't have to worry about it  .  
 is that you  janice  ?  just speaking  .  
 but on our part  our government is reluctant to approve of l  c payment for our imports  .  and there is the licensing problem  .  
 i do n't think we can make it  .  
 by the middle of october  .  
 do you still remember we already have a new year celebration on january 1st  ?  
 do n't be rush  .  it is suggested to write a letter for the personnel department of future clothes company  .  
 sounds like a good idea  .  and i think this can leave deep impression to hr  .  how can we write a suitable letter  ?  
 just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company  .  and you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you  .  
 what can i do next  ?  
 let me affirm this again  the first shipment of 1000 cases  to be delivered in 27 days  by june 30  and the second shipment of 2000 cases by august 15  .  right  ?  
 actually not so good  .  that 's why we made a special trip to see you  .  
 ok  let me hear it  .  i 'd be glad to help if i can  .  
 it can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight  .  
 all right  .  but we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us  .  
 well  we can proceed with the order until after the christmas holidays  .  our factories will be closed for another week  .  
 that 's all right  .  we will send you a purchase order in one week  .  i hope you will be able to take care of it  .  
 well  actually in most cases we do n't talk about special deals  but since this one is so new i will listen to what you have to say  .  
 we want to make this a trial order  .  if we can sell all the products in two months  we will pay for them  if not  we will send them back to you  .  
 i ca n't agree to that  .  my company will have to pay for both sending them and bringing them back  .  
 of course  just five minutes ago i got the phone call from future clothes company and i was told to start my trial period in that company next monday  .  
 well  i am worried to death right now  !  there is still no news from the company for me  .  
 well  please look at the employment contract  .  i 'd like to go over the main details again before signing  .  first  you will be getting a monthly salary  and no probation is involved  .  
 yes  i get it  .  will the medical plan cover me while on duty  ?  
 well  sir  i am busy in market development  .  so i am worried whether i can do this  .  
 i am aware you have been working so hard  .  before hiring more employees  you are still needed to do this  .  
 working with my colleagues  we were able to increase the production efficiency by 5   .  
 just use your head  .  if you were definitely making some big mistakes  you would be informed  .  
 yes  .  and you also overworked in last month  when steven asked for leave  .  i have been very satisfied with your performance  .  and your dependability has been a great asset  .  
 what 's wrong  ?  we have been working overtime recently  .  
 the holiday is coming so we need to finish our task  .  
 do n't worry  .  i will tell him about that  .  
 really  ?  when will she come back  ?  
 good idea  !  the pictures will illustrate the performance of our products vividly  .  
 a  do your best  it 's very important  .  
 please trust me  .  i will finish it very well  .  
 maybe you could hire me on trial  if i  m not qualified for this position  you can let me go  .  
 hi  jimmy  good morning  .  
 we really believe that you are a highly qualified person  .  but the other candidate has several years of related experiences  .  
 sure  .  
 i have prepared name cards to be put on the conference table for everyone to sit by  .  what time would you like to provide the refreshment  ?  
 hush  !  the wall has ears  you know  .  
 i will be there after 20 minutes  .  
 why not  ?  you 've done so well for the company  .  she should give you a prize  .  
 i do n't think the thing can be that serious  .  you should face the result  .  besides  i do n't think the position is the best for you  .  
 hello  i 'd like to speak to mike please  .  
 yes  123 456 789  mary from happy travel  .  have you got that  ?  
 forget it  .  good luck  .  i hope you can make it  .  
 when you start to work  i  ll give you  3000 a month  .  
 why do you plan to change your job  ?  
 i 'm now a secretary in my present work unit  .  my work is not interesting  .  i have to type  make copies  book tickets and so on  .  everyday i follow the routine  .  furthermore  i have studied english for four years at university  but i can  t use it there  .  they are the reasons i plan to change my job  .  
 yes  i applied with another company  but that was just to get experience in being interviewed  .  
 yes  one customerone file is essential  .  and remember to update them timely  .  
 correct  .  
 i took accounting as my major  .  
 i was in charge of cost price and sales revenue  .  
 correct  !  i have threeday visit to shanghai on december 10th  .  
 yes  madam  .  
 well  everything we 've discussed seems to be here  .  
 do you mean that we are responsible for putting them together  ?  
 sounds good  .  
 can you give me a wholesale list  ?  
 working under pressure is exciting and challenging  .  i don  t mind working under pressure  .  i work well under that circumstance  .  people can  i can  .  
 i 'm afraid he 's having an important meeting now  .  can i help you  ?  
 it takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures  so i can not bear it anymore  .  it is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills  .  
 again  ?  
 to be frank  you are not the only one who applies for an agent for us in your country  .  i 'd like to know some ideas of terms on which you would be willing to operate as our agent  .  
 you may have known that we have competitors from south korea and other countries  .  at the beginning of our campaign  there is sales resistance to overcome  we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and tv programs  .  a 20  commission will not leave us much  .  
 yes  sir  .  most of us had positive review in last quarter  .  take fred and david for examples  .  both of them try their best to achieve the best  .  their progress is distinct  especially in last quarter  .  
 come on  !  what are you nervous about  ?  
 but we still have to find one  .  can we find arden to check whether this is true or not  ?  
 i 'm sorry  but to be frank  considering exploiting the market in your country  we have already supplied you at very low preferential price  .  
 another question  .  could you tell me the earliest possible time of shipment  ?  
 to have this business concluded  i should say a reduction of least 10  would help  .  
 i ca n't agree with you  .  we have quotation from other sources too  .  their prices are lower than yours  .  
 that 's wonderful  .  i appreciate your efficiency and cooperation  .  
 now we should design our booth  .  do you know the number for our booth  b  ?  
 we can also consult some from these volunteers  .  
 would you sit down and write down your name and address here  ?  
 this is the latest design for our products  .  the design of iseries keeps the fashion in a close way  .  the sales volume of the new product is about 50000 per month  .  and we received many orders from many clothes companies  .  new functions and attractive outlook are the key points for our products  .  
 yes  i need to talk to him  .  
 hi marry  this is tom  .  
 one moment and i 'll check  .  
 sure  just a moment  .   .  .  .  i 'm sorry no one answer the phone  .  
 we 're here today to present to you the results of our marketing research regarding the consumer behavior  .  
 oh  .  i 'm sorry but i just accepted another offer which i feel is better suited to my needs  .  
 based on what you said  does it mean that we can not have a trademark like genova  right  ?  
 yep  !  i heard that your company is registering a new trademark  .  
 ok  i 'll try her back then  .  
 could you put it in detail  ?  
 that 's a bit more than i was prepared to pay  .  
 what did you say  ?  
 that  s sex discrimination  .  when will you get the reply  ?  
 possibly  subject to quality and delivery guarantees  .  
 yes  marry  ?  
 i see  .  
 i 'm sure you are  .  
 ok  .  make sure the power is switched off then tighten up all the bolts on the unit and replace the broken blade  .  why is there oil all over the floor  ?  
 perhaps one year  i 'm not sure  .  
 i understand  .  when do you think i can come and see him tomorrow afternoon  ?  
 please let me check  .  tomorrow afternoon  yes  he 'll be free from 200 tomorrow afternoon  .  do you think it 's convenient for you  ?  
 well  i do n't like it  but i guess i do n't have any choice  .  
 ok  .  keep me informed  .  jt must be ready on time  .  
 that 's excellent  .  how have you managed that  ?  
 what does that mean exactly  ?  
 well  we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers  .  
 we have n't had any problems so far  .  they offer a 24  hour technical backup service  .  we 've called them in three times this month  .  they always arrive within a couple of hours  .  
 i 'm an apprentice with a local engineering firm  .  my training lasts for two years  .  two days a week i study engineering at a local college  .  if i pass all my exams  i hope the company will take me on as an engineer  .  
 yes  .  i have a great team working with me  .  
 sure  we provide semiannual bonus  a small bonus at spring festival  four weeks paid vacation a year  .  
 i told you so  .  i kept having problems with it yesterday  .  i do n't know what 's wrong  .  
 well  you sound ill over the phone  .  
 yeah  i 'm in the office till 10 every night  .  i ca n't take it anymore  .  the pay just is n't worth it  .  
 why do you choose our company  ?  
 what do you know about our company  ?  
 the motor vehicles division  .  i work in our belgian factory  .  we manufacture components for our car production plants in europe  .  
 where are dak headquarters  ?  
 i appreciate you frankness  .  do you know anything about our company  ?  
 yes  .  it 's a korea company and it was built in beijing five years ago  .  
 so how do you develop good relationships in the office  ?  
 i am in charge of the trading department  .  
 please tell your name  company and the nature of your business  .  
 yes  it is really hard  .  but you must believe that you will find a suitable job finally  .  when you work  you can accumulate a lot of experience  .  besides  you need to learn a lot of things while you are working  .  
 i 'm glad you could come to see us off  .  i have enjoyed your interpreting  .  you have done a wonderful job  .  i hope you be my interpreter again next time i 'm here  .  
 what does cabs stand for  ?  
 oh  great  !  let 's discuss it together  .  now  when am i off then  ?  
 of course  .  a twoweek paid vacation a year  a fiveday workweek  .  
 yes  .  that 's the company policy  .  
 besides the official holidays  our company offers a ten days paid holiday every year  which makes it possible for you to visit your parents  .  any other questions  ?  
 why do you want to resign  ?  
 why  ?  
 i am in charge of the trading department  .  i 'm handling invoices  shipping bills and computing freight costs  that 's most of the documentation  .  
 so if i do n't print out very much  it could last a lot longer  ?  
 that 's fine  .  do n't forget to update the inventory  .  
 i 'm glad you 're replacing it  .  we need more space to work on things  .  how deep will the new workbench be  ?  
 it 's quite a delicate piece of equipment  so i hope it was wellpacked  .  it 's oblongshaped  about 50 cm long  .  it 's made of metal  .  
 they 're setting up the machine for a new run  .  
 about twenty minutes  .  
 what does the unit consist of  ?  
 what about your use of raw materials  ?  
 all right  mr  .  smith  .  i 'll be sure he gets your message  .  
 he 's not in  i 'm afraid  .  
 mr  .  smith  did you have a good journey  ?  
 i just feel a little tired  .  you know  it took me 16 hours to get here  .  
 i believe i will  .  
 let me check my diary  .  er  .  i 'm afraid i ca n't make tuesday  .  i 've got to go to beijing for a conference  .  i 'll come back on thursday  .  
 how do you do  mr  .  smith  ?  let me help you with your luggage  .  
 did you have a good trip  ?  
 yes  i did  .  besides  here are all the reports and materials handed out in the meeting  .  i think you 'll have to do some replies  .  
 what should a secretary do to prepare for a meeting  ?  can you tell me a bit more about it  ?  
 of course  she should take minutes  .  
 certainly  mr  .  baker  .  
 yes  we have a showroom not far away from here  mr  .  black  .  are you free now  ?  
 take your time  sir  .  i can wait  .  
 you 're welcome  .  this is my duty  .  anything else  ?  
 ok  .  would you like this report done in a formal or informal style  ?  
 i 'll get the first aid box  .  there 's some antiseptic cream and a bandage in there  .  
 mainly plastics  .  plastics aren  t bio degradable  they don  t break down easily in the environment  so they should n't be thrown away  .  
 455623  .  
 that 's right  .  
 thank you  .  
 thanks  .  i 'll look into it and let you have our firm offers tomorrow  .  
 thank you for allowing us 3  reduction  but still we find your price is on the high side  .  
 if so  we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks  .  
 do n't you agree with me that in the long run  moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit  ?  
 we 've already cut down our price to cost level  .  
 great  i 'm glad we 'll be able to do business together  .  i 'll have some quotations ready for you by tomorrow morning  .  
 we have trained analyzers to do quality analysis at the end of each part when we make the product  .  this means that no mistakes are made  .  
 i still have no idea what to do now  .  
 but what  ?  you always act like this  when you face difficulties  .  
 raise the alarm by breaking the glass of the nearest fire alarm  .  call security  say fire and give your name and exact location  .  at night you should phone the fire service from the nearest telephone  .  
  afternoon  miss liu  .  are you typing my report  ?  
 nothing  .  i just tell you take care of it when you type  especially the address and telephone number of those new guests  .  you should make sure that it 's no mistaken  .  
 have you had any previous experience  ?  
 may i know about the office hours  ?  
 we 'll give you about 3000 to start  .  there 'll be a trial period of three month  .  after six months  we 'll have a job performance review and consider giving you a raise  .  
 when will i know your decision  ?  
 i 'll call you in a day or two  did you write down your phone number on your resume  ?  
 well  shall we get down to business  .  
 yes  we finished the evaluation of it  .  if the price is acceptable we would like to order now  .  
 what 's your best price for that item  ?  
 very good  .  it 's been a pleasure to do business with you  mr  .  smith  .  
 the pleasure is ours  .  can you deliver the goods by march 31  ?  
 sometimes  the narrowminded people make me frustrated  .  
 i am afraid that is not acceptable  .  your contract says that you will deliver a product with a reject rate of less than six percent  .  
 i was responsible for helping patients restore their organic functions  training them in speech and organism  carrying our massage and physiotherapy  taking care of patients nutrition and diet  .  
 they are sense of post  mentality quality  first aid ability  emergency adjustment  and law consciousness  .  
 no problem  .  
 let me say something about the falling australian dollar  .  we 're both hurt by the rising u  .  s  .  dollar  .  we will have to pay more renminbi for u  .  s  .  dollar to buy wool from you  .  
 ok  .  i need to discuss it with our manager  .  we 'll let you have our firm offer next week  .  
 and anything else  ?  
 i have just left school  but i am well acquainted with office work  .  
 yes  .  to develop my knowledge  i studied economics  business administration and accounting through selfstudy  .  nowadays  i have passed three courses on cpa  .  
 thank you  .  it 's a pleasure to meet you  .  
 when do you expect it to be finished  ?  
 all right  .  
 what else do you have to prove your english ability  ?  
 i stick to my principles and keep to the rules  .  sometimes  they just lack enthusiasm  .  when i get them involved with something constructive  some of them change their attitude later  .  
 do n't mention it  .  oh  this is a small gift for you  .  
 am  .  no  i have an urgency to talk with him  .  
 thank you  !  i will  .  when and where will the dinner be  ?  
 it 'll be a national campaign starting next week  .  
 i suggest that we focus on slice of life  showing how you can beat the summer heat by biting into a cool icecream sandwich  .  
 ok  !  how long dose it take you to deliver if we order 1000 pieces of silk  ?  
 within 2 weeks once we receive your orders  .  
 we 'd like to visit the factory  .  can you show me the way  ?  
 we established the strict qc standards and we have followed it for about five years with good results  .  
 where are the workers from  ?  from the villages nearby  ?  
 i will try my best  .  here is the draft  .  would you please go over it and see if any modifications are needed  ?  
 let me have a look . well  it contains basically all we have agreed upon  .  
 if you totally agree  i 'll type the agreement this evening and have it duplicated for signatures  .  
 that 's fine  .  
 ok  .   sign  once a contract is signed  it has legal effect  .  
 you 're right  .  thank you for your cooperation  .  
 yes  but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible  .  
 we can provide you with standby letter of credit established by bank of china  .  
 yes  i have received an engineers qualification certificate and a drivers license  .  
 that 's too bad  .  we could really use someone who is bilingual  .  
 i studied english in junior and senior high school  .  and in college  i took english conversation lessons  .  they were given by foreign tutors  .  
 great  .  can you file in english  ?  
 yes  i think i can  .  i often talk to foreigners at english corner held twice a week at my college  .  they say my english is pretty good  .  
 ok  !  i 've noted it down  .  and any others  ?  
 oh  !  i 've almost forgot the location was transferred to the a county in the east of the city  .  
 just what are you proposing  ?  
 i hope so  dana  .  my instructions are to negotiate hard on this deal  but i 'm trying very hard to reach some middle ground  .  
 then you 'll have to think of something better  robert  .  
 we are faced with the problem that part of the consignment is unacceptable  .  we assume that damage occurred during the consignment was in your care  .  
 we deal with kid 's clothing  women's clothing  and men's clothing  .  you name it we deal with it  .  
 for the substantial regular customers  we offer 5  commissions  .  
 i 'm afraid you 've got the wrong extension  .  
 now mr  .  tylor 's on the line  .  go ahead  please  .  
 that  s a good idea  .  you have plenty of experience in marketing  don  t you  ?  
 by the way  i saw a job in the paper this morning that you might be interested in  .  
 really  ?  what is it  ?  
 anyway  it is worth trying  .  
 how can we protect our patents and trade market abroad  ?  
 your price has gone up sharply  has n't it  ?  
 that 's ok  .  
 i understand your position  .  
 the last two years we have seen an increase in sales of about 30  to 40  each year  so i  m very pleased  .  and our sales projections are quite good for the next two years  .  
 how do your experiences benefit our company  ?  
 i know the marketing from top to bottom and i can develop a new market for you  .  
 then  what starting salary do you expect  ?  
 i 'd like to start at rib 4000 a month  .  
 good  .  let 's iron out the remaining details  .  when do you want to take delivery  ?  
 but even with the overhead out  the export overhead must be put in  .  finally  it comes to the same thing  .  anyway  this is a quality item and should be sold on its value  .  
 do you have anything published  ?  
 could you tell me the particulars  ?  
 certainly  .  
 tariff provides the government with extra tax revenue  .  
 tariff raises the price at which the goods are sold in the importing country and therefore makes them less competitive with locally produced goods  .  
 how should i know  ?  it 's not my responsibility  .  
 i have been playing football since high school  .  at present  i  m a member of a community football club  .  
 it depends on the type of work  .  usually i prefer to work alone  because i  m selfmotivated  .  but i can work either way  .  if necessary  i don  t hesitate to join the team  .  
 are you more of a follower or a leader  ?  
 certainly  .  a letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted  .  a memorandum is a communication within an organization  .  
 oh  yes  miss chen informed that the monthly management meeting has been changed to july 11 and i 've marked your diary accordingly  .  
 to maintain a high standard of nursing  we should take experience and education into consideration while considering a nurse 's level of expertise in caring for various patients  .  
 well  to begin with  i would say she needs to be diligent  and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative  .  finally  she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing  summary writing  keep minutes at meetings  and so on  .  most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average  .  
 that 's fine  .  what about operating the fax and duplicator  ?  
 above all  i have learned that what is good for the company is good for me  .  so i follow the instructions strictly and always keep my boss informed  .  
 very good  .  
 my main duties include designing survey sheets  transferring them to the dispatchers  making telephone covering on blurred information and processing the data and doing the primary analysis  .  
 that 's good answer  .  i appreciate your being frank  .  
 how do you do  jack  .  nice to meet you  .  
 what 's your proposal then  ?  
 what 's your counteroffer then  ?  
 well  to encourage future business  i 'm prepared to reduce the price by 10   .  we ca n't go any further  .  
 so are we  our counteroffer is in line with the world market  .  
 some of them are of the latest style  .  now i have a feeling that we can do a lot of trade in this line  .  we wish to establish business relationship with you  .  
 your desire coincides with ours  .  
 that sounds interesting  !  i 'll send a fax  .  as soon as i receive the definite answer  i 'll give you a special answer  .  
 that would be great  !  how about 230  ?  
 yes  i had a look just now  i feel we can do a lot of business in this line  .  
 nice to meet you  !  
 that sounds reasonable  .  
 i want to be in a higher managerial position in the field of international marketing  .  i  m very interested in the european market hopefully  in brussels  .  
 what are you looking for in your next job  ?  
 my experience in my last job showed that i have the talent to motivate people  .  it could be seen from the low absentee rate in my team  .  i want to continue that kind of contribution and to further develop this potential  .  
 no  i haven  t had any professional experience  but i have always been interested in creative writing  .  
 have you ever had a foreign instructor in english composition  ?  
 i would be glad to do routine work sometimes  if i could be assured of making advancements in the future  .  
 i am new to the work and i will appreciate your guidance  !  
 i will try my best to assist you if you need any help  .  
 oh  yes  i do  .  my present job is similar in that respect  and i think i  m doing a good job  .  
 yes  the main stockholder is international business machines corporation  namely  ibm for short  .  
 what section would you like to work in if you enter this company  ?  
 what ideas do you have if we employ you  ?  
 i  ll report it honestly  .  i  ll give a correct analysis  .  i may quit the job  and pay compensation  .  but i have my way to judge whether i fail  .  
 getting more experience with a widelyknown company like yours  .  using my speciality in marketing and management  .  and getting advancement in salary and position  .  show my enterprise  confidence and character in passing  .  
 we got the contract  !  
 yes  it is  .  but we 'll be making a decision on it pretty soon  .  why do n't you come in and fill out an application  ?  
 well  i 'm already in this field and know most of the companies  .  before i come in to fill out an application  i need to know who it 's with so i know whether or not i 'm willing to work with them  .  
 i think the only reason is that i was too nervous during the interview and i could n't express myself the way i wanted to  .  
 get your hair done at a good hair saloon  .  tell them you are going for a job interview  .  
 you were right  .  it was from a headhunter  .  she would n't tell me anything without a contract  .  
 great  so are you going to sign a contract with them  ?  
 ted  .  oh  and could you give her this document for me  ?  
 well  first you have to turn this switch on  .  
 thank you  i 've learned so much from you  .  
 thank you  sir  .  
 pardon  ?  
 gladly  8962105 2  .  
 your products are very good  but the price you ask is much too high  .  
 they are reports of our company  .  
 can you find last month  s report for me  please  ?  
 sorry  we have two smiths  robert smith and jim smith  which one would you like to speak to  ?  
 don  t boast and don  t be modest  .  
 what do you mean by this  ?  you can  t do the two things at the same time  .  
 i see  .  
 is that right  ?  wonderful  wonderful  .  i 've been in king dao for two years now  .  a great place  .  nice people and great beer  !  well  i guess we  d better get started  .  
 that  s right  .  
 please take a seat  .  
 thank you  madam  .  
 are you more of a follower or a leader  ?  
 what kind of personality do you think you have  ?  
 are all these helpful for the interview  ?  
 nice to meet you  mr  .  peter  .  i  m wang sian  .  i  ve come for an interview as requested  .  
 i majored in public relations  .  
 the export business section  .  
 yes  very much  .  
 there is a reason in what you say  .  
 i want to work in the english department  as i am an english major  .  
 you mean the network connection  ?  
 i have the same question  .  i can  t send out mails  .  we  d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately  .  
 though our company doesn  t have a return policy  limiting the personal use of internet  i don  t think the boss will like us to do that  .  
 what do you think are the capacities for a success as a translator  ?  
 get your hair done at a good hair saloon  .  tell them you are going for a job interview  .  
 that 'll do it  .  the best way is to find the dressing color code of the company  .  
 black is good  .  
 how about make up  ?  
 where are you working  ?  
 ok  .  do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken english  ?  
 yes  .  
 well  they  re older  and they don  t understand today 's fashions  .  when they see someone dressed like that  warning bells go off  .  they don  t like that style at all  and they don  t like dealing with people who dress like that at work  .  
 i see  .  
 it  s a very important experience for me  .  first  it improved my organizing ability  and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective  .  second  it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who i like or dislike  .  
 maybe i should try looking on the web for work  .  
 but there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net  .  you might have no chance  .  
 yes  i know i am excellent  but i pay no attention to the etiquette you  ve told me  .  
 oh  we need your resume  health report  three photographs and several letters of recommendation  .  would you please send them to us by next wednesday  ?  
 how do you do  mr  .  james  ?  thank you for asking me to come in  .  
 i am smith  the personnel director  .  please have a seat  son  .  
 of course  here you are  sir  .  
 i live in beijing  .  
 it 's only a couple of dollars more  .  for that much money you can afford to risk it  .  
 this is for registration  .  after you have given us your personal details  we 'll match these against new jobs as they come in  .  and we  ll contact you when there is a job that suits you  .  
 i see  .  thank you very much for your advice  .  bye  .  
 well  no surprise there  .  
 as a newcomer  you are going to be responsible for some basic tasks first  including certain routine duties like answering the telephone and typing  .  later  you will be assigned to the sales department  .  
 sure  here is my business card  .  i 'm james wilson  .  let me explain to you how things are  .  in recent months  the demand for residential properties has become extremely high  .  the price of residential properly has risen almost twenty percent  .  
 i would like to ask for four point five million hong kong dollars  .  
 i 'm not sure  .  i ca n't agree  dan  .

 you should never chew gum or smoke during an interview  even if you are allowed to do so  .  
 sure  .  
 as long as it is n't too far from this city  i do n't mind  .

 pay more attention to the external expressions  because they are important for the first impression  .  good manner and style of conversation can let other feel your good selfcultivation  .  good gestures and mien can let other feel very comfortable  .

 of course we can  .  we can provide the quantity you ask for  .

 thank you for saying that  .  but what 's the unit price  ?  
 your price is rather out of line  much higher than we expected  .  we ca n't buy with your offer  .  
 but the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
 that 's much higher than i expected  .  can you come down a bit  ?

 here is our brochure  .  it 'll help you get acquainted with our products and company  .  
 a month before the time you want the goods to be delivered  .  
 it sounds reasonable  .  the clause should be like this  any disputes arising from the execution of this contract shall be settled in a friendly way  .  if no settlement can be reached through consul  nation and conciliation  the disputes shall be submitted for arbitration by a mutually nominated arbitrator  .  the arbitrator 's decision on the dispute is final and binding on the both parties  .  
 no  you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment  .  
 i see  .  by the way  how do we prove the ownership of our goods  ?  
 because you need a senior production planner who is good at mathematics and fluent in english  .  i think i am fit for the position  .  
 yes  i have learned japanese as well  .  
 no  .  i only wish that you could give me a definite answer to my application as soon as possible  .  
 i 'm sure  .  you know my major is statistics and i get excellent records in all of the courses i have taken  .  
 thank you  .  
 ok  .  let me see where to start  .  
 yes  .  and do n't forget to list them by date  .  besides  you should begin with the most recent and then move backward  .  
 no  it 's also necessary to list a few related interests that are in some way connected to the jobs you want to take  .  
 oh  good point  .  you mean here i should show off my special skills and talents to impress the boss  .  
 you are the leading company in the computer industry  .

 but if i do n't pass  will you call me  ?  
 ladies should wear professional suits  either classical style or free style  .  it would be appropriate to wear a little or no makeup  .  
 but those fashionable and shiny clothes should be avoided  .  
 in a word  dressing and appearance are indeed important  but it should never be all  .  
 that 's great  .  you need to prepare for it  .  
 buy an expensive suit  .  
 yeah  fine  .  and dressing leather shoes  .  
 it does n't matter  .  just do your best to sell yourself  .  
 people here desire mediumpriced air freshener only  .  please carefully consider my proposal  which will lead to a larger business between us  .  
 yeah  that 's what i thought  .  but  i 've heard that the perks are better  .  i was wondering if that was really true  .  
 we 'd better take it up with them  in that case  .  
 actually  i have applied to several companies recently  .  but i am most satisfied with your company  .  
 if you succeed in doing that  you must attend the interview on time  .

 i stayed in l  .  a  .  and it was sunny the entire weekend  .  we spent most of the time at home but we did go see king kong on christmas day  .

 please allow me to introduce myself  .  my name is li hua  .  nice to meet you  .  
 so you do n't have much related work experience  .  
 admittedly  i do n't  .  but i still beg you to give me an opportunity  and i 'm willing to learn with my best effort  .

 i can also speak a little japanese  .

 i  d like to bring to abc company not only my technical skills  ambition  enthusiasm  but also my loyalty  .  a sincere desire to become an administrative assistant is the heart of my career plans  .  
 ok  please first fill in the form and return it to me  .  you can do it in the next door  .  
 what about the 3rd round  ?  
 i 'm offering them to you at 150 yuan a piece  .  is that all right  ?  
 really  ?  are you willing to recommend me for the position  ?  
 are you sure you 're not reading too much into what he said  ?  
 well  i think you may be overreacting  .  mitch likes to give everybody constructive criticism and i think that 's what he was doing  .  
 i said i am informing you of the interview  .  
 yes  .  i think it is now a moderate volume  .  
 please ask  .  
 i was wondering what kind of resume do you prefer  an eresume or a paper one  ?  
 yes and no  .  let me see if i can clarify that  .  the terms are the same except that the contract for training has a clause that allows for the cancellation after the first six months  .  
 the stock exchange where i worked was too small my further promotion was impossible  .  i am able of more responsibilities  so i decided to leave  .  
 hello  everybody  .  i am monica and this is my first day at work  .  i am working in the finance department  .  i am very happy to meet everyone and i am looking forward to working well with all of you  .  i am very happy to be one of the team and i will do my best to get into the working situation as soon as possible  .  by the way  call me monica  .  everybody calls me so  .  
 listening carefully can show you understand and respect the speaker  .  
 to show that you have understood what is said  you can nod or ask simple questions at the right time  .  
 yes  that is me  .  nice to meet you  monica  .  welcome on board  !  
 well  we have nicer things than that in this company  .  you will find out soon  .  
 really  ?  what could that be  ?  
 well  i bet you will love them too  .  if you need help  just ask me any time  .  i am in the next door  .  you can also reach me through the extension 508  .  
 in the interview  use polite words  such as thank you  or please  .  
 to encourage the staff increases  .  
 what about the afternoon  ?  
 state your opinion or argument first  and then go on with details  .  
 never should you give an answer completely beside the point  .  
 confirm the question if you do n't catch it clearly  .  
 it can help you leave a deep impression on the interviewer  .  
 working conditions are very relaxed  .  you may work whatever hours you want  provided you get your job done properly  .  
 do you have training program or plan for employees  ?  
 try to show the best of yourself with decent words and manners  .  
 you must have confidence in yourself  .  
 that 's great  .  thank you very much  .  
 well  that is the chart showing our company  s organizational structure  .  
 ok  .  on the top  mr  .  thomas  the managing director  is responsible for running the company  .  
 ok  .  who should i report to  ?  
 i just had a complete physical examination and passed with flying colors  .  
 i feel my greatest asset is perseverance  that is  the ability to stick to things to get them done  .  
 why do you say that  ?  
 it is 15 minutes drive  .  
 it  s such a large firm  .  do we have our own staff restaurant  ?  
 other company rules also need your attention  .  
 you can win a good impression of the interviewer in this way  .  
 finally  at the end of the interview  make acknowledgments to the interviewer again  .  
 i propose a toast to your pleasant tour in china  .  
 what range of salary do you have for this position  ?  
 how will you solve the problem  ?  
 you can nod or ask questions at the right time to show that you have already understood or you are quite interested in his words  .  
 do n't move from time to time  .  it is very impolite and will make you nervous  .  
 throughout the interview you should maintain patience  .  
 just say goodbye to the interviewer before you leave  .  
 the company introduction  our mission  vision  various policies  insurances  pension plan  company id  batch  telephone  email setup and training  .  
 no  i do n't  .  please  .

 nice to meet you  too  .  let me show you around  .  
 it certainly has been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories  .  
 it was fun for me  too . it gave me a chance to get away from my routine and do something a little different  .  
 no one  .  
 how did the business trip go  ?  
 no  should i have  ?  
 sure  .  
 i thought you 'd be a bit more excited about this  .  everything will be paid for and i 'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you  .  all you have to do is to get on the train tonight at 7 pm  .  
 oh  no  .  we 've bought your return ticket for you  .  i think you 'll find it comfortable  .

 when she first walked into the room to greet us  she did n't shake our hands or introduce herself at all  .  i thought that was a bit unprofessional  .  
 that 's true  .  i guess we  ll have to keep looking for a manager then  .  
 that 's it  .  i am maria smith  .  you must be zhang lin from tianjin sports facility co . ltd  .  
 you are very modest  .  best luck in your new position  .

 i went to yale university  .  
 and could you tell me what other jobs you have had  ?  
 en  ?

 i know i should be pretty happy here  but i 'm not finding the kind of job satisfaction i need  .  i 'm a good graphic designer  .  .  .  
 that 's kind of you to say  .  but  .  .  .  the stuff we do here has n't really challenged me very much at all  .  
 well  i know brown's biscuit factory are looking for a porter . they pay  200 a week  .  
 as i see it  he lacks the proper vision  .  his style is more about survival  and he 's not taking the company anywhere . he s treading water instead of swimming  .  
 i 've been with this firm for 26 years and i 'd hate to see it go down the drain due to poor leadership skills  .  
 interesting idea  .  you might be on to something  .  
 good  .  i 'll take care of it  .  
 wait a second  vince  .  you know what  ?  why do n't you let me handle it  ?  
 i saw your green postit notes  .  nobody else has them  .  
 you would n't do that  .  would you  ?  
 so you 're really planning to quit invoking and switch over to webtracker  ?  
 right  .  and that would be a total gigabummer  .  
 they 're small fry  .  tonight i 'm going to la to negotiate with stars . com  .  that 'll be big  .  
 exactly  .  
 look  we need to have the stars . com account  right  ?  
 that 's all right  .  i 'm almost finished . do you need my help  ?  
 i told you to get this consignment out last week . we ca n't very well run a light bulb conference without any light bulbs  can we  ?  what am i going to do with you  ?  
 how long do you think she 'll be  ?  
 can i leave a message  please  ?  
 thank you very much  .  
 what 's the matter  ?  
 did n't we make that appointment a long time ago  ?  
 great  .  then i 'll be at your hotel at two  .  
 how could i get there  ?  
 an impressive officer is vital to the image projected by the company  .  
 there are people everywhere . what s that girl doing  ?  
 she is dealing with customers and driving up new business  .  the guy next to her is in charge of their office computer network  .  
 i see you have a coffee bar for a water cooler  .  the staff here must be comfortable  .  i think it really helps morale when people feel supported by their employers  .  
 what working experience have you got  ?  
 frankly  some part of it i enjoy very much  but i prefer something more professional  .  it happens that i have a friend working here in this company  .  she told me the export department was to recruit an assistant  .  i felt very excited at this news  .  that 's why i 'm here  .  
 did i  ?  well  anyway  you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up  .  
 i 've been here for 3 years  and i have n't had a raise in all that time . if you like my work  it should be reflected in my pay  and i feel it is n't  .  
 yes  .  i was wondering if i could take another two weeks off  .  
 i want to leave the department  .  do you think i could put in for a transfer  ?  
 that 's nice  .  
 besides chinese  i can speak english and french  .  
 you mean you can read and write both of them  ?  
 what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy  ?  
 i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends  .  a person ca n't live all by himself i think  .  a friend in need is a friend in deed . the more really close friends i have  the better  .  
 what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking  ?  
 do you know how to use a pc to process the management information  ?  
 why do you think you be a good fit or this job  ?  
 yes  we do  .  we like it very much  .  
 all right  madam  .  when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store  .  i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent  .  
 where would you like to be in 5 years  ?  
 do you have any different ideas  ?  
 yes  very  .  i thought the last speaker was especially good  .  
 well  i 'm not too happy about it  .  
 well  i 'm afraid it 's not at all what i wanted  .  you have n't really followed my instructions . it ll have to be done again  .  
 you  re welcome  .  i  ll see you tomorrow at 2 00  .  
 345 stony creek avenue  .  
 i met with the supervisor just this morning  .  i do n't know  but i am a little worried  .  who do you think will get sacked  ?  
 well  actually i want to tell you that i 've put in notice  .  
 i know  .  but i 'd like to try  .  look  here are some advertisements that i 've cut out  .  
 yes  my name is brian and my phone number is 5294870  .  
 how did he know that he had bad mouthed him  ?  
 your duty is to keep a check on those prisoners from now on  .  
 yes  i  m quite satisfied with your qualifications  .  
 and how well can you speak them  ?  
 i see  .  well  we have a lot of spanish customers  but you would n't need to write any spanish here  .  
 what 's your unloading port  please  ?  
 is there any possibility for you to ensure prompt shipment  ?  
 why didn  t we choose an office in the cbd  ?  
 i think i  m very good at planning  .  i manage my time perfectly  so that i can always get things done on time  .  
 i don  t try to go ahead of people and lead them  i  d rather cooperate with everybody else and get the job done by working together  .  
 let  s see  .  .  .  these numbers are off the charts  !  what 's going on here  !  
 yes  i overlooked some facts  .  i  ll be more sorrow  .  
 it  s challenging  i feel i have learned a lot  .  
 i get along well with people  and i enjoy working with others  .  
 it  s hard to commute a long way  .  
 actually  i received that kind of training when i was in college  .  
 very useful advice  i will try them right now  .  
 thank you for saying so  .  i don  t know  probably because i like sharing my experience and knowledge with them  .  i think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues  .  
 that is true  .  some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way  .  for example  it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people  .  to show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off  .  
 i had meetings back to back all morning  .  and phone rang off the hook from the minute i walked into the office  .  
 thanks  vivian  .  
 sounds like our boss  .  typically him always late with important information  .  anything i can help  ?  
 was he unhappy with you not attending the meeting  ?  
 then how about a salesman  ?  
 that  s the way to go  .  
 ok  .  
 i 'm sure you 'll pass it  .  
 hi  i was just coming to see you . but since you made the trek to my office  you get to go first  .  
 i 'm supposed to have this package ready for mailing out tomorrow morning and i 'm miles away from being ready . can you edit this product study i wrote while i do these  ?  
 give me the study  .  i 'll start as soon as i get back to my office  .  
 asap  in writing of course  .  
 the usual guys  so you better use a sharp pencil  .  
 thank you  .  
 then i will see you in my office at ten wednesday morning  .  
 what a pity  !  
 thanks  .  actually  i was really surprised  .  i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there  .  
 all right  .  
 ok  see you 10 o 'clock next monday  !  
 2781703 1  .  sure  .  i 'll make sure he gets the message  .  
 he 's dancing with jack  !  
 gross  !  
 no  .  he 's so far away i can hardly see him  !  let 's keep eating  !  
 i 'll call him and tell him you 're here  .  
 the accounts department  i think  .  
 actually  there 's a way to keep the kitchen god from telling the bad things you did  .  
 i think so  !  just serve a lot of sweet dishes next week  .  that will make the kitchen god say sweet things about you  !  
 other than the employees  our boss jack invited some friends of the company  .  
 hmm  .  we do n't exactly have the best seats in the house  do we  ?  
 he 's away on a business trip  .  he wo n't be back until some time next week  .  
 thanks  .  and could i have his email  just in case i ca n't get him by phone  ?  
 our red underwear did n't do any good at all  !  
 okay  so  .  .  .  to whom it may concern  i am writing  .  
 um  tracy  ?  i think that s a little too formal  .  i know you want to be polite but you 've already made contact with them  so in english you can be more relaxed in the opening  .  .  .  
 almost twenty years  .  we were the first total pr services company of our kind in california  .  
 that 's wonderful  .  is n't your company part of are corporation  ?  
 that 's not bad  .  how long have you been in pr  ?  
 i figured i might as well send one or two of them out  .  maybe my luck will get better  .  
 i see  .  and how about the working hours  ?  
 i don  t think so  mr  .  parsons  .  i think you have covered all the main points for me  .  
 yes  of course  .  that  s quite an important point  isn  t it  ?  as a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150000 hk dollars per annum  .  this doesn  t include a generous housing allowance also  .  
 well  anthony  this is not going to be an easy conversation . the company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment  .  
 what  ?  why  ?  i mean  .  .  .  just like that  ?  i  m fired  ?  
 what  !  i resent that  !  
 yeah  well  that was some good advice  .  you made some really good points  .  
 certainly  may i take your name  ?  i  ll let her know you  ve arrived  .  
 sure  it  s josh o  neil  .  
 well  i guess so  .  
 well  the thing is  we ran into a lot of problems  .   .   .  
 i  m not going to put this off any longer  casey  !  i want those photos asap  !  
 yes  .  i do n't want to be stuck in a rut  .  i want to move on  .  
 oh  that sounds terrible  .  would you be happier with higher pay here  ?  i  m sure something can be worked out  .  
 i 'm sorry to say that we have to let you go  john  .  
 ok  .  i need to think about that for a while  .  
 i 'm happy to hear that  but publishing is more than just talking to writers  .  it involves a lot of work  patience and responsibility  .  most of the work is boring  .  
 do you have any complaints  ?  
 maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss  .  
 oh  i always have difficulty in getting along with the staff  .  
 our copying machines are too slow  our telephone system is limited in function  and our offices are not wellequipped for us to work efficiently  .  to improve the offices for higher efficiency  we have to change all the chairs and some of the desks also  redesign our office so that we may have more space  .  
 come in  please  .  
 hmm  .  .  .  tell me more details about our jobs  .  
 oh  really  ?  would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected  ?  
 i don  t think so  .  as the saying goes   a great oak needs deep roots  .   i  m really interested in this job  .  
 that  s fine  .  thanks for coming to see us  .  i hope to be able to let you know about the job within the week  .  
 i really love this kind of atmosphere  .  
 yes  .  are there chances for employees to be transferred to overseas branches of the company  ?  
 certainly  .  this is an international company  and ther 're good chances for you to work overseas  .  
 ok  your work experience is impressive  and i think you sound right for this position  but i do have 3 other people to interview  so you 'll be hearing from us within a week  .  
 yes  i see  .  in my previous job  i did typing and filing everyday  .  
 what kind of software can you use  ?  
 i hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field  .  since my major was international banking  i really hope to work at a bank  .  
 i expect to work hard  madam  .  
 how often do you have meetings  ?  
 i  ve met some of my colleagues already  .  i  m sure we  ll get on well together  .  
 that  s right  .  make sure you give the accounts department all your bank account details as soon as possible  .  
 do you plan to pursue further education  ?  
 i hate dealing with complaints  .  was it a legitimate complaint  ?  
 they are all listed here on this sheet of paper  .  
 unless it  s marked differently  it  s their home numbers  .  
 they should have then listed on their resumes  .  
 and if there aren  t any email addresses  ?  
 then send them a sms on their cell phone  .  
 ok  .  that sounds easy enough  .  have you called any of them yet  ?  
 yes  .  i called the first three people on the list  but they didn  t pick up  .  
 ok  so  maybe i should call her again  .  
 see you  .  
 so  you are leaving  are n't you  ?  
 that will be very nice  .  you 're too kind  .  
 i 've already made a hotel reservation for you  let 's go to the hotel first and drop off your things  .  then  i 'd like to have a drink so that we can get better acquainted  .  i 've booked a table at an exclusive restaurant downtown  .  afterwards  i 've made arrangements to take you to see the city lights  .  seattle  s nightlife can be really quite exciting  .  how does that schedule sound to you  ?  
 i 'm usually too busy to take a bunch of coffee breaks and gossip by the water cooler  .  anyway  i am sure the memo never got to my inbox  .  i 'll have to talk to our secretary about it  .  
 yes  sir  .  .  .  
 this should go out as an intraoffice memorandum to all employees by this afternoon . are you ready  ?  
 can i leave a message for him please  ?  
 well  i am not sure  .  lets me check my agenda 
 well  i guess you will meet many people in this field  .  so don  t forget to pack enough business cards in your suitcase  .  
 ok  there is no cash advance anymore for short trips  .  you have to pay out of your own pocket  so save all the receipts from your business trip  .  and then attach them to your expense account  .  when you get back  our company will reimburse everything  .  
 i see  .  what about the maximum purdy and rate  any change  ?  
 er  ?  i am driving right now  .  can you call back in 30 minutes  ?  
 thank you for calling  .  i really appreciate your kindness  .  but right now  i  m very busy preparing for an interview of another company  .  i don  t think i am available for this opportunity  .  
 you  re welcome  .  bye  .  
 no problem  .  good luck  .  
 where are you  ?  
 very useful advice  i will try them right now  .  
 i just sense  .  but i cannot grow anymore  .  my boss is not really supporting me  .  i am interested in some positions in other jv companies  but i need to do some more instep research before i send my application letters out  .  
 ok  good luck to you  .  
 sorry  i am not sure  .  can i take a message  ?  
 i  ll do that  .  meanwhile  could you give me an indication of price  ?  
 the basic salary for this position in our company would be 4800 yuan to start with increases giving according to your performance  .  
 so if we did allow the laboring force to go home early  how many people are we talking about  ?  
 we will provide you wit life insurance  health insurance  accident insurance  housing benefits  heating allowance and transportation allowance  .  
 do i have training opportunities  ?  
 you  re welcome  .  
 fine  .  we will handle domestic shipping  but what about customs  ?  will we have to pay tariff on our imports  ?  i hope we do n't run into any problems with the border control  .  
 yes  that is me  .  nice to meet you  monica  .  welcome on board  !  
 really  ?  what could that be  ?  
 no  i am afraid not  .  i just arrive in town today  .  
 have a seat please while i call  .  
 i said  is mr  .  thomas there  ?  
 not really  i  m in a meeting  .  can i call you back in  .  .  .  say  .  .  .  15 minutes  ?  
 sure  speak to you later  .  it isn  t urgent  .  maybe it is easier if i send you an email  .  
 how do you work with a team  ?  
 what  s your long term goal  ?  
 yes  except the personal mail  .  and i also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the email box regularly  .  
 yes  i want to restate one more time the importance of reinventing our company 's image to appeal to different customer bases  .  i want to end with a true story that has to do exactly with what we 've been talking about today  .  .  .  
 no  they are filed according to dates  .  
 no problem  here you are  .  
 i think you are looking at the wrong line  .  the rapid drop in sales was n't our hair products  .  you are correct  the hair product sales decreased slightly  but not dramatically  .  the one that did n't do so hot this month was the cleaning products  .  i think there was a problem in the marketing plan  .  some people were offended by our advertisements for the cleaning products  but it was already too late to mitigate the damage  so our mistake shows up in the sales  .  
 ok  no problem  .  we do it ourselves  .  
 we got numbers back from our offices in beijing  hong kong  taipei  singapore and tokyo  we 're waiting on bangkok and kula lumpur  .  
 what do the preliminary figures tell you  ?  any kinds of trends going on for the branches in the far east  ?  
 for example  ?  
 hello  lucy  .  
 yes  i have decided to work with your company  .  
 it  s my honor to be one member of your company  .  i  d like to begin to work any time as you like  .  
 you  re welcome  .  
 i was wondering  i have heard many of my cowokers that your knowledge and experience in international markets is phenomenal  .  also  i  ve heard the rumor that you speak fluent japanese  .  is that right  ?  
 what percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings  ?  i 'm guessing not a large percentage  .  .  .  
 so  how much say do the stockholders really have  ?  
 what about the senior account managers  ?  do they count  ?  
 the classes have him out of the office  so that is stressful for him  .  but as far as homework goes  it is a breeze for him  .  
 it 's just a piece of paper  you think that they can tell if i am a wellrounded person by looking at it  ?  
 well  that is the chart showing our company  s organizational structure  .  
 i felt after five years in one place  i was ready for something new  .  i would like to have a job that is challenging  something that i can see and do new things every day  .  i loved many things about my former job  and i left with amiable feelings on both sides  .  i was just ready for something new  .  
 i hate to tell you this  but it seems that every shred of evidence that would help us to convict were destroyed in a laboratory fire  .  there 's nothing left  .  i 'm so sorry  .  .  .  
 yes  i have several copies  but they 're all different versions  .  .  .  the latest i have is version 12  is that current  ?  
 no  .  later we decided to opt for the prior outline  version 7  .  
 yes  he knows i 'm coming  .  our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock  .  
 that would be very nice  .  thank you  .  
 what docking station  ?  
 i have the same question  .  i can  t send out mails  .  we  d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately  .  
 though our company doesn  t have a return policy  limiting the personal use of internet  i don  t think the boss will like us to do that  .  
 certainly  work always comes first  .  
 it is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate  .  it is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices  .  
 so you have to open all the envelopes  .  
 do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them  ?  
 no problem  here you are  .  
 that  s normal after a tense work evening  .  working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either  .  once  i worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend  .  that really broke my rhythm and i got a little sick later  .  
 you seem to have a very relaxed outlook  .  
 never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder  .  
 don  t mention it  .  
 sure  what i can do for you  ?  
 totally agree  .  by the way  the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506  .  you can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor  .  
 sorry  i don  t know the rule about punching  .  
 that  s ok  .  i should have told you earlier  .  this is a company rule  .  
 from 11 thirty to 1 o  clock  .  
 but remind you  there are some forbidden activities  .  
 how long will the tour take  ?  
 ok  i will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure  .  is there anything else we need to order while i am at it  ?  
 let me key in your information into my computer  .  i will pull up our records for you  .  do you have an order number  ?  what name is the order listed under  ?  
 wonderful  .  thanks very much  .  
 shall i see you on friday morning  ?  
 that  s not good for me at all  .  it  ll have to be another time  .  
 that  s all right  .  then see you on friday afternoon  .  
 that  s great  .  what are the prizes  ?  
 ok  .  next thing is laying the cornerstone for the new plant at 10 am  .  at 12 am  back here for lunch  .  
 at 2 pm  give a presentation here with the press  .  at four o  clock sharp  have dinner with mr  .  smith  manager of ncc  .  
 yes  sir  .  
 yes  it will print immediately  .  
 well  all right  .  there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents  information and other things  .  
 check with somebody from the it department  .  they are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment  .  
 i  ll get them for you at once  .  and could i file the report for you  ?  
 yes  but i need the report copied on transparency paper  .  
 i 've been offered another job with higher salary  .  and it also gives me the opportunity of promotion  .  
 yes  i do  .  i like traveling very much  .  
 what about next monday  ?  
 yes  i will see that the room is ready by friday  .  and i will check there are enough chairs  and the lighting and airconditioning are all right  .  
 mr  .  black  i don  t think my boss will talk to you  .  it  s a chinaman  s chance  .  
 you think so  ?  let  s take a chance  !  
 does mark wyatt work there  ?  
 well  um  sir  the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control  .  look at these bills for example  .  just this month we  ve paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges  !  
 why do you think you might like to work for our company  ?  
 well  i am always energetic and enthusiastic  .  that 's my strongest personality  .  
 would you tell me something about your family  ?  
 what personality do you admire  ?  
 i suppose i 'm a reasonable student  .  i passed all my tests and enjoyed studying subjects that interested me  .  
 sure  it  s josh o  neil  .  
 ms  .  stevens will be with you momentarily  .  can i offer you something to drink  ?  
 i know  !  it  s an amazing growth opportunity  !  they  re true industry leaders  and it would be so interesting to be part of an organization that is the undisputed leader in business process platform development  .  
 so  let  s see  you did your research on the company  right  ?  
 interesting  .  and  your postgraduate studies  ?  
 i know  and i apologize for the delay  .  but some things were just beyond my control  .  i had trouble booking the photographer  and then michael was sick for three weeks  so i couldn  t include him in the photos  and the design team lost all the files  so i had to redo the pictures  .  
 that 's all right  .  but could you tell me how often and how many hours i should work overtime  ?  
 mr  .  smith  i 's like to ask you a question  .  
 yes  .  i specialized in english secretary studies at college and that 's one of the main parts of my present job  .  
 i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary  .  maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position  .  
 are you in good health  ?  
 i 'll try to speak in another language or i 'll try my best to use gestures and draw pictures  .  
 i see  .  
 can i give her a message for you  ?  
 what are your responsibilities in your present work  ?  
 good morning  .  you are mr  .  sun  are n't you  ?  take a seat  please  .  
 that sounds fine  .  why did you choose to apply to our company  ?  
 why are you interested in this occupation  ?  
 if a passenger had a accident  what would you do  ?  
 if you are hired  when can you start work  ?  
 now press this button  .  
 i have been a production manager  .  
 wonderful  .  then how many employers have you worked for  ?  
 yes  .  after my graduation from university  i worked as a customer service coordinator in a foreign representative office  and then i transferred to a joint venture as a market development manager  .  so i am familiar with the market in china  .  
 what have you learned from the jobs you have had  ?  
 i learned to be patient when dealing with customers complaints and try my best to solve them  .  in addition  i learned at my previous jobs how to cooperate with my colleagues  .  
 does your current employer know you are looking for another job  ?  
 very good  .  
 i like to be paid more than that  .  hopefully  120000 yuan per year  .  
 i think you 'll find i 'm worth that  .  
 i think salary is closely related to the responsibilities of the job  .  shall we discuss my responsibilities with your company first  ?  
 i expect to be paid according to my abilities  .  
 come on  what have you got to lose  ?  
 i 'd like to start this interview with some questions  .  why do you think you are qualified for this position  ?  
 according to your advertisement  you want an experienced software engineer  .  i think my background meets the requirement of this position  .  
 yes  can you tell me what 's my responsibility in this position  ?  
 good  .  have you got any other questions  ?  
 ok  i will contact you in a week  .  see you  .  
 well  i was born in shanghai and went to school there  right up through college  .  my father is a lawyer  and my mother is a teacher  .  
 that right  .  one of my sisters is a doctor and the other one teaches at a university  .  
 yes  good morning  .  this is mr  .  suzuki from video tv  .  may i speak to mr  .  johnson  ?  
 from video tv  .  
 yes  video tv  .  
 ah  never mind  please  .  
 ok . there are four persons in my family  my parents  my elder sister and me  .  
 are you mr  .  wu  ?  
 nice to meet you  too  .  did you have any difficulty finding our company  ?  
 nice to meet you  too  .  
 do you feel comfortable with the new system by microcosm  ?  
 yeah  just fill out this form and choose a password  .  the computer will do the rest  .  
 i see  .  the problem  however  is that i ca n't be confident in giving you a good priceless i am confident your product will last  .  
 well  can you be more specific  ?  there are a lot of websites about that  .  
 for detailed information  however  you should read a history book  .  
 do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow  ?  or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too  ?  
 i 'm afraid  .  .  .  
 all right  all right  .  he 'll get them as soon as possible  .  
 i got laid off today  .  
 all right  i  ll leave her the message  mary  .  thanks for calling  .  
 nice meeting you  too  .  goodbye  .  
 what was the most significant project you 've worked on  ?  
 they 'd say i was a handworker and a real team player  .  
 what are your salary expectations  ?  
 i have 10 years financial industry experience  working for several companies  .  for the past two years  i have been working in an investment banking  .  in addition to my analytical mindset  i have a background of solid accounting principles  .  i am a team player and have great communication and interpersonal skills  .  i thrive on challenge and work well in highstress environments  .  
 i 'm not finding the work as challenging as i used to  .  i want to find a job that is stimulating  where i can grow  .  
 i 'm sure whatever you offer will be a fair amount for a person with my qualifications  .  salary is not the most important factor to me  .  i 'm looking for opportunity  .  
 what are your future plans and what kind of expectations do you have of the company  ?  
 how often  ?  
 what is your greatest weakness  ?  
 i have worked on a variety of projects and jobs in the high tech industry  .  i wanted to have the experience of working for a dotcom and have learned something about being in on the ground floor of a business  .  
 why did you leave your last position  ?  
 do you have any questions  ?

 thank you  .  yes  i am dunlin  .  
 after a few years of gaining experience in the company and furthering my professional qualifications i 'd like to put my experience and skills to use in management  .  i want to become a supervisor in your r  d department  .  
 yes  .  if you undertake additional courses  provided these are approved  and you complete them successfully  you can claim back part  quite a large part  75  of the costs you incurred  .  not just the fees   traveling and other expenses too  .  
 anything else  ?  
 i am a senior mechanical design engineer  .

 of course  please hold the line mr  .  hunter  .  
 a reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company . any extended illness will be covered by insurance . have you read the other terms of the contract  ?  
 do you have any other questions  ?  
 just one  .  i noticed an item about flextime . is that a possibility for me  ?  
 i am sorry  but i do n't have one with me right now  .  
 yes  it is really hard  .  but you must believe that you will find a suitable job finally  .  when you work  you can accumulate a lot of experience  .  besides  you need to learn a lot of things while you are working  .  
 you have no choice  so you 'd better adjust your thoughts to be ready to learn anything at any time  .  
 nice to see you too  mr  .  brown  .  won  t you sit down  ?  
 good  .  is there anything you find changed about the fair  ?  
 we are glad to hear that  .  what items are you particularly interested in  ?  
 i  m hoping you can sort a few things out for me  .  could you pull up my account  ?  
 that 's quite all right  .  
 not too worry  so tell me about yourself  .  
 wait for my instructions and then proceed accordingly  .

 i had to complete an end of quarter report once while i was on the road for two consecutive weeks . the amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible  because i could't bring my office files with me . luckily i had a great secretary and a logical filling system  so we located everything we needed  .  
 i 've always given priority to work with established clients  because they offer a better risk  return value . the last thing i do is general correspondence  especially internal correspondence  which i take care of at the end of the day or week  .  
 yes  .  but he is meeting a client  .  
 oh  that 's very kind of you  .  thank you very much  .  i 've got to go  .  
 good afternoon  could you connect this call with mr brown  please 
 i 'm afraid mr wilson would like to speak to mr brown right now . he s got an urgent matter to discuss with mr brown without delay  .  
 what do you expect  ?  i 've been working for you for three years  and you 've never given me a holiday  .  i do n't feel well today  because i have a terrible headache  .  i am not in the mood for being gentle and polite  .  if you ca n't stand it  it 's your problem  .  i am not going to change  because i think it suits you best  .  
 i apologize for forgetting myself  but i do need some time off  .  
 good morning  !  i am anna lu  .  i 've come for an interview which was arranged  .  
 i do n't mind that  .  
 our employees receive 15 days of paid vacation every year  .  if you do n't use the full 15 days  they carry over to the following year  .  
 yes  we have an excellent retirement plan and medical insurance as well  .  
 if you have a few minutes  i 'd like to talk to you about my future at this company  .  
 yes  of course  .  
 hello  mr david richton  this is min wang calling from network  i am calling about the reporter position you advertised on the internet  .  
 that is wonderful  .  
 the work is rather hard  but it 's interesting  .  
 well  i need a hand with the fax machine  .  my fax is not going through  .  
 ok  i 'll try and put you through  .  please hold  .  
 let me repeat that back to you  .  that 's zero  double seven  eight  seven  three  six  seven  double six  double eight  .

 i got it  .  when should i have her call you back  ?  
 i need to talk to you about that new secretary you  ve hired  .  i think i  m going to have some problems working with her  .  
 thanks  .  i can wait here  .  
 i  ll have to think about that  ms  .  solomon  .  
 certainly  sir  .  we can wait another day or two  .  
 i  m sorry  jeff  .  please don  t interrupt me right now  .  i  m in the middle of a conversation  .  
 oh  i  m sorry  ms  .  montgomery  .  i  ll come back later  .  
 all right  mr  .  jones  .  do you think we  ll need anything else  ?  
 no  liz  .  i asked you specifically  .  don  t you remember  ?  
 i  m really sorry  mr  .  samuel  .  i really don  t remember that  .  
 that  s okay  martin  .  if you could just bring it in tomorrow  i  d appreciate it  .  
 not until next week  i think  the 15th  .  
 i  m sorry  janet  .  i left it at home  .  i  ll bring it back in the morning  .  
 the sooner  the better  sandy  .  i don  t think he  ll sign anything till he  s got that in his hands  .  
 i  m concerned about your lack of marketing experience and  frankly  your age  you  re pretty new at all this  .  
 sounds good to me  .  you make up the invitations  i  ve got run  .  i  ve got a meeting in five minutes  .  
 hi  susan  .  what can i do for you  ?  
 i  d like to take tomorrow off if that  s all right with you  .  
 i was hoping you would write a letter of recommendation  .  i want to enter a master  s program in marketing  .  it  s all on weekends and evenings  .  
 good news  !  i  ll be glad to  .  when do you need it  ?  
 that  s fine  as long as you can get that report typed up before you leave  .  
 how so  ?  i thought it went fine  .  
 no  that  s all right  .  paula  .  why don  t you get something to eat  and i  ll see you this afternoon  .  
 yes  .  ms  .  gray  .  is there something wrong  ?  
 sure  .  why don  t you sit down for a minute  ?  you haven  t taken a rest all morning  .  
 certainly  ms  .  ransom  .  do you have an order number  ?  
 great  .  are you a qualified teacher  ?  
 can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 1000  ?  
 i 'm sorry  but mr . tomas left here just a few minutes ago  .  
 great  .  i will make my reservations as necessary  .  
 just make sure to turn in all the necessary paperwork to ensure there are no problems with the days you want to take off  .  
 our standard package includes health insurance  two weeks vacation and a company car  .  
 no problem at all  .  to tell you the truth  i could use the extra time in my schedule to catch up on some paperwork  .  
 sure  .  doing your homework and preparing for an interview really pays off  .  
 i  ve researched the company and think i  m perfect for the job but i  m not sure how to get it across to them  .  
 to be honest  i don  t plan in that much detail  .  my goals tend to be general  i define success according to the job at hand  .  i see myself advancing as i succeed  but i don  t necessarily dwell on 
 that depends a bit on the problem at hand  .  there are certain situations in which a manager can give a general directive  and expect his employees to know how to take the initiative on the detail 
 yes  but when you send in your expense report  you also have to file a report summarizing your trip  .  it  s not just a big vacation  you know  .  
 yes  i packed it myself  and it hasn  t been out of my possession  .  
 oh  right  .  you  re in our system  .  i was just looking under li  .  so  we  ve got you down for a business suite for three days  .  if i could just have your credit card  i  ll process your checkin while 
 actually it  s a common practice to overbook  as passengers often don  t take their flight as scheduled  .  most of the time there is no problem but today  more passengers arrived than we have seats  
 ok  .  i  ll volunteer  .  i could use a free ticket  !  
 i  d like to use my master card  if i could  .  hey  wait a minute  !  this is a bit more than i expected  .  why is it so high  ?  
 i had no idea  and look at these charges for movies  !  
 those are for payperview movies  .  each time you selected a movie  the entertainment system prompted you to confirm that you really wanted it  right  ?  
 yes  please  .  and i want some glue  .  
 i only have small boxes  .  do you want one  ?  
 what else do you want  ?  
 yes  that  s correct  .  
 i understand  .  so that  s one ticket to new york  and you  ll be departing tonight  .  will that be oneway or round trip  ?  
 umm  .  .  .  you know  .  .  .  actually i was thinking of trying another airline  .  no need to hold my seat  .  
 wonderful  .  i  d like to know why you  re interested in this position at our paper  .  
 i don  t think he  s back today  .  
 oh  that  s right  .  go ahead anyways  .  i  ll fill him in  .  we can  t lose this order under any circumstances  !  
 she had a very impressive resume  but she seemed to lack the confidence that i think a good manager needs  .  
 oh  no problem  .  
 ok  .  ask away  .  
 first  i  d like to know if you offer employees sick leave  .  
 i see  .  i guess that makes sense  .  
 yes  please  .  
 it 's my mother  .  she 's sick and needs someone to take care of her  .  i 'm the only one who can do it  .  
 it was horrible  !  it was just one thing after another  .  
 have you updated your cv  ?  
 well  i wanted to let you know that i 've put in my notice  .  
 the head office is in new york  but i 'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time  .  
 i 'm sorry to bring this up  but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go  ?  
 thanks  .  i appreciate that  .  
 if you gave him another 30 days  do you think he could figure it out by then  ?  
 that 's perfect  .  i 'll let him know tomorrow  .  thanks  !  
 oh  .  i had hoped she would have called me back yesterday  .  
 she 's terribly sorry about that  .  she had to leave the office suddenly and wo n't be able to return until next week  .  she hopes you understand  .  
 she asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today  .  when are you free today  ?  
 of course  .  i spent so much time at my old workplace that i got to know them all very well  .  they were like family to me  .  
 do you like working in teams  ?  
 that 's a good idea  .  you have plenty of experience in the tourism industry  do n't you  ?  
 it 's a job at a recruitment agency  .  
 sure  it 's the ad circled with a red pen in the middle of the classifieds  .  good luck  !  
 yes  .  my name  s mark benson  .  i just started a couple of weeks ago  .  
 thanks  i appreciate that  !  
 i 'm in between jobs at the moment  .  
 what kind of job are you looking for  ?  
 not if you are good at networking  .  do you like to meet new people  ?  
 do you have experience in the it field  ?  
 great  !  
 i did n't know that before  .  
 smile at the interviewers and look them in their eyes while trying to persuade them to select you  .  try to act natural  let your personality  ability and interpersonal skills shine through the interview 
 that 's true  .  beijing is the political  economic and cultural center of the entire country  .  
 and there 're higher salaries there  .  
 i 've considered that  .  i 'll share an apartment with others to save the rent  and the cost of living wo n't be too much for only one person  .  
 you certainly had a busy day  .  
 that  s not all  !  i also had to finish writing a sales report for my boss  .  in the end  i finished everything  .  i wonder what will be waiting for me tomorrow morning  .  
 thank you  .  is your company going to move to other cities  ?  
 why is that  ?  
 could i first ask about the remuneration package  ?  
 i don  t think so  mr  .  parsons  .  i think you have covered all the main points for me  .  
 i hope to hear from you very soon  .  
 well  as you know rebecca  in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five  .  you could be on call at any time  .  we do have to work very unsociable hours at times  .  
 yesterday  !  but no  we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month  .  
 well slowly but surely i proved myself  and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer  .  
 well  you know journalism is a highly competitive world  so you do need to keep pushing yourself it  s true  .  okay  well let  s move on to talk about the job position here  shall we  ?  
 that  s right  .  we  ll finish them just in time  .  the macy project can wait for the time being  .  we need to spend several days on that project  but it isn  t due to be finished until the end of the month  s 
 don  t say that yet  .  a new project could suddenly appear  .  
 i  ll stop by if i have time later  .  make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines  .  
 i will  .  enjoy your meeting  !  
 i  m not sure that  s a good idea  .  
 how can a business maximise revenues  ?  
 yes  i do  .  i don  t like it very much  .  
 yes  .  we  ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries  .  we hope to sign another three this month  .  
 has and advertising campaign been prepared  ?  
 that  s right  although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there  s something important to do  .  the lunch break is flexible  .  you can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer  .  
 you are entitled to a company car  .  have you seen it yet  ?  
 ok  .  this is your cubicle  .  at first  you  ll be responsible to me  .  later  you  ll be working more independently  .  
 no  that  s all  .  i already have your resume  .  
 i got my connections  !  just tell me what you want and i  ll even give you one ounce for free  .  
 yes  .  
 i see  .  but  many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking americans  .  
 she has blond hair and blue eyes  .  
 each mp belongs to a political party  right  ?  
 what  s a cabinet  ?  
 how do people choose which party or candidate to vote for  ?  
 oh  dear  .  did you lose a lot of money  ?  
 you must tell the embassy about it  .  and i think they  ll issue you with a new one  .  
 yes  .  i  ll do it tomorrow  .  
 about 12 o 'clock  when i came home from work  .  
 probably  .  let 's check the inside then  .  
 yes  i already have one  .  
 try it and if you ca n't do it  one of us can always help you later  .  
 yes  well put your name on it after you have downloaded it off the company website  .  ok  ?  
 just make sure you show your total  sign it  and turn it in  .  
 you are a quick learner  .  i do n't think you 'll have any trouble with this  .  
 you can always look an extension up on the company website  .  
 yes  i can help you with that  .  pick up the receiver and hit one of the buttons  .  do you hear a tone  ?  
 to call a number on the outside you now just dial the number  .  for inside calls  punch in the extension number  .  has someone given you an extension list  ?  
 well  when you hear it change  that means you have an outside line  .  where are you trying to call  ?  
 all right  please take this message and call this client  .  
 yes  i understand the numbers  .  
 i will try  .  my apologies  .  
 i appreciate you saying that and would like you to join us in our meeting  .  
 i have no idea what the entertainment should be  .  
 i 'm not sure . medium  i suppose . maybe a little on the heavy side  .  
 cow while boots  .  
 no  i did n't  .  i 'm innocent  .  those are n't mine  .  whatever you found is someone else 's stuff  .  you ca n't prove anything  .  i was n't there when you went in  and you ca n't prove it 's my stuff  .  
 i would like to help you with both  .  
 that will work out fine  .  do you think that chinese or continental food would be best  ?  
 everything sounds great then  !  i 'll meet you back here on friday to discuss the details  .  
 yes  .  i had a bad traffic accident . look  my car looks like a squashed coke can  .  
 did you see the car before it hit you  ?  
 ok  please move your vehicle off to the side of the road  .  we will check on it  .  do you feel like you need an ambulance  miss  ?  
 no problem  miss  .  
 five i think  .  all three candidates are presenting their campaign platforms  .  
 it 's not that serious  .  
 how ay years have you been working with him  ?  
 about 15  .  i 've seen him work hard for a lot of good changes  .  
 he would be good  .

 we have a requisition form on the company web site  .  what type of supplies do you need  ?  
 i need all of my supplies right away  .  
 an understanding of the basic workings of a company and the services or goods it provides is essential  .  do you have that  ?  
 there are different ways of conducting a job search  .  do you know what you want to do  ?  
 schedule an appointment with a counselor and you can get more information  .  would that work for you  ?  
 everything that you need for a successful job search is here  .  happy job searching  !  
 i want to work in a restaurant  .

 i want to speak to you about this year  s election  .  
 i feel that history is about to be made  and i want to be a part of it  .  
 yes  i am going to vote  .  
 thank you and good luck  .  
 what do you want to speak to me about  ?  
 oh  you do  ?  
 what made you decide to volunteer  ?  
 good for you  .  
 what am i supposed to do now  ?  
 i 'd like to put some valuables inside  you know  documents and jewellery  things like that  .  
 i 'll have to ask my wife how long she 'll need it for as it is mainly for her belongings  .  i 'll come back after we have discussed it  .  thanks for your help  .  
 you can have more than 1 key if you 'd like  but we must have signature cards for each box  .  
 you 'll need to deposit 1500 rib initially  .  there will also be some small additional charges for this service  .  
 i hope so  .  i 'm in the process of applying for a credit card with you  and ms wang asked me to drop off these documents  .  
 the minimum deposit is 1500 rib  .  but you will need to pay some small additional handling charges as well  .  
 what if i require a loan for a short period of time  ?  
 what if i repay it early  .  any perks  ?  
 so  the quicker i pay it back  the more i can save in interest  ?  that 's excellent  .  thanks so much for your information  .  i 'll come in shortly to take the relevant steps for the loan  .  
 it 's our pleasure  .  we are always happy to have another satisfied customer  .  thanks for calling  .  goodbye  .  
 i 'm just fine  thanks  jane  .  i 'd like to make a withdrawal from my current account  please  .  
 i need some advice about my fixed deposits  .  
 of course  .  as we provide many different services for all of our valued customers  we like to give than a special place to do their business with us  .  
 there are all kinds of deposit services and also the calculations of the interest  .  it 's specific to different accounts and different circumstances  .  
 the list goes on and on  !  
 can i give you some advice on a loan  or  .  .  .  
 i would like to cash my undue largeamount deposit certificate  please  .  
 mmmm  .  .  .  yes  many investors do n't seem to be into stocks at the moment  .  too risky  !  how about openended funds  ?  
 it 's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember  your certificate is due in 2 months  .  if you can hold on to it  it 'll be much better for your finances  .  
 absolutely  jenny  .  thanks very much  i think you 've saved me quite a lot of money today  .  
 i need to have a credit check done for my company  .  
 that 's no problem  .  do you offer any other consulting services  ?  
 that 's excellent  .  well  for our personal automobile consumer loan we offer some really competitive rates  .  the maximum repayment period for this type of loan is 5 years  .  
 of course  the interest rates depend on what is announced at the time  but at the moment  the interest for a 2  year loan is 5 . 29  
 i usually put them into my bank account  .  i think that is a little secure  though the interest rate is low now  .  
 are you an existing customer  ?  
 i 'd like to apply for a credit card with you  .  
 my salary is pretty high and i 've never had a problem with my credit rating in the past  .  are there any perks of the platinum card  ?  
 really  ?  
 yes  .  as long as you keep making regular monthly payments  paying the minimum is just fine  .  of course  your credit limit will be lowered accordingly  .  
 is there anything else  ?  
 the lady at the desk  shelly i think  told me you offer many other consultancy services  .  
 we do indeed  .  such as making trade investments  financial consultancy  and of course the service you requested  .  
 10 years ago  maybe yes  .  but nowadays we are a global village  it 's easy to deal with any foreign country  .  
 that does sound good  .  i 'm already an account holder  have been for many years  .  and i already have your existing card  .  
 yes  that 's one of the main things we are interested in  .  when do you think i can get hold of this report  ?  
 as it 's confidential there is a certain amount of red tape  but it should n't take too long  .  there is  of course a service fee of 300 rib to be paid  .  
 so quick and easy  !  thanks very much  .  
 nothing  thanks  .  i again apologise for the misunderstanding  bye for now  .  
 oh  i see  .  i thought maybe it was just the time of the day  although it is n't usually busy at 230 in the afternoon  .  
 thank you  .  here 's your card back and your money  .  please double check it for me  .  
 shall i come in and collect it  ?  
 what seems to be the problem  ?  
 here it is  .  i usually use the machine  but there seems to be such a long queue at the moment  .  
 ok  done  .  when will it show in my account  ?  not for withdrawal  i mean just registered  .  
 that 's fine  .  ok  .  thanks  .  
 a direct debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account  no fuss  no hassle  .  
 but how will you know how much i should pay  ?  i mean  i receive my bills  not you  .  
 yes  i 've found a wonderful property i wish to buy  .  unfortunately  i just do n't have access to the cash  .  
 so  you 've already made a large initial deposit  ?  that is good news  .  ok  let 's have a look at your credit details and get this started  .  
 i already have an account with you  so it should be pretty straight forward  .  
 you can go to any branch of iba and request the emergency assistance service  .  everything will be taken care of  there 's no need to worry  .  
 thank you so much  .  i 'll find the nearest branch and come in tomorrow  .  thanks again for all of your help  .  
 just calm down  sir  .  ok  when do you think you lost it  ?  
 i 'm not 100  sure  around an hour ago i guess  .  i had it in the hotel lobby bar  i used it to charge something to my room  .  i obviously did n't pick it up again  .  
 yes  i 'm here  .  what details do you need from me  ?  
 please  go right ahead  .  
 i 'm mike kowalski and my card number is 5211678 44  but there are some other numbers at the beginning  .  i 'm not sure what they are  .  
 before i verify those  i need you to fill in some forms  .  then  as i said  i need to see valid credentials  your occupation and income details  .  .  .  
 you are authorized to borrow up to 20000 rib  with a repayment period of up to 1 year  .  
 and then i just sign here  ?  you 're right  !  it certainly is simple and extremely convenient  .  
 everything is right here  .  if that 's all in order  just let me know where i sign  .  
 certainly  sir  .  i 'd be happy to  .  the personal pledge loan is a loan secured by undue certificates  time deposits  for example  or visible treasury bonds  .  
 the initial amount is just 2000 rib  but we can go up to 100000 rib  .  but remember  it cannot exceed the amount on the certificates you are using as collateral  .  
 i  m not sure where to pick up my ballot  .  
 i have it right here  .  
 i had to mail in an absentee ballot  .  
 i  m not going to be able to vote this tuesday  .  
 oh  i understand  .  
 i sure did  .  how about you  ?  
 you voted for him  right  ?  
 i am so happy that he is our new president  !  
 you do  ?  
 our country really could use some work  .  
 i believe that change has already begun  .  
 what do you feel about gay marriage  ?  
 you can always just check online  .  
 i hope you voted for him  .  
 i made sure to vote for him  .  
 i am really excited about this  .  
 yeah  .  i am so excited that obama won  .  
 i am  too  !

 i applied for the job online  .  
 i  m working at the polling place  .  
 i  m on my way to work  .  
 where do you work  ?  
 how much do they pay  ?  
 it doesn  t matter how much  .  
 we go door to door asking for donations  .  
 you should try other fundraisers  .  
 that  ll help you make more money  .  
 you think so  ?  
 i can  t believe people voted for him  .  
 that doesn  t make any sense  .  
 how could the news get any worse  ?  
 i was only kidding  because obama won the election  .  
 i hope so  .  
 i can  t believe i  m actually speaking to a candidate  .  
 you can ask me questions  if you  d like  .  
 i think that is really cool of you  .  
 is that right  ?  
 i also agree with all his policies  .  
 hopefully  he will be  .  
 i would like to talk to you about this year  s election  .  
 i am a volunteer for this year  s campaign  .  
 i am so excited to be voting  .  
 sure  you can  .  
 i understand  .  
 yeah  but what day are the elections  ?  
 i can  t believe you didn  t know when the elections were  .  
 did i hear about it  ?  i saw it happen  .  
 that 's insane  .  
 he did n't even make it out the door  .  
 could you come to the station for more questioning  ?  
 look closely at the five men in this lineup  .  
 i was in the bank during the robbery  .  
 what about my rights  ?  
 i was n't aware that i had to go to court  .  
 could you explain what you saw  ?  
 what kind of case do you have  ?  
 i charge  150 an hour  .  
 that  s my rate  .  
 there is a warrant out for your arrest  .  
 i have a court date coming up  .  
 that  s what i charge  .  
 where did the breakin happen  ?  
 i 'm not sure yet  .  
 what makes you think there was a breakin  ?  
 it happened last night  .  
 what 's wrong  ?  
 i got robbed  !  
 do you want me to take you  ?  
 what 's going on  ?  
 did he hurt you  ?  
 your left brake light is out  .  
 i 'm not sure  .  
 really  ?  i 'm sorry  .  i did not know that  .  
 i 'm sorry  .  i did not know that  .  
 i have to write you a ticket  .  
 how much will the fine be  ?  
 you don  t have plans to end up back here  do you  ?  
 good luck with your life  .  
 good luck out there  .  
 i wish you luck  .  
 the police officer that pulled me over said i was speeding  .  
 to be honest  i really was n't  .  
 what speed were you going  ?  
 do n't worry about it  .  
 no  your honor  i was not  .  
 is the arresting officer in the courtroom today  ?  
 there was no picture taken  so i 'll let you go  .  
 when did this happen  ?  
 were you able to get a look at this person's face  ?  
 they did  ?  
 here are some leaflets detailing everything we 've discussed  .  
 what is it used for  ?  i mean  why bother to get this special account  ?  
 today i 'm here to find out about paying in foreign currency  .  you do that here  i suppose  ?  
 counterfeit notes these days can be very sophisticated and difficult to spot with the naked eye  .  but i must warn you that if it does show to be a counterfeit i have no option but to confiscate it  .  
 well  it 's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes  .  so  unfortunately you 'll lose this 50 rib  .  we 'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated  .  
 ok  here you go  .  
 i want to make a deposit  .  
 ok  just a moment  .  i 'll find the relevant data and help you with that  .  
 not just a thoughtful granddad  but a generous one too  .  
 i have a time deposit here and i 'd like to get the money now  .  
 i 'd like to withdraw 35000 rib from my corporate account  .  
 ah  yes  ms reeve  .  i have all of your information here  .  do you have the cash cheque  ?  
 i 'm sorry  we cannot make corrections on these  .  you 'll have to bring another one with the correct amount  i 'm afraid  .  
 you can withdraw money from your account either over the counter or via the atm  .  
 yes  but the problem is that i have a savings account with you  and i need to take some money from that  .  do i really have to give 90 days notice if i want my money  ?  
 you can use a type a agreement savings account the same was as a settlement account  .  
 of course  sir  .  what kind of currency would you like to deposit  ?  and what is the amount you would like to pay in  ?  
 and how long are you depositing for  ?  
 that should n't be a problem  mr fang  .  have you got your certificate of use of foreign exchange account and the foreign exchange account opening notice with you  ?  our most widely used currencies are us dollar  japanese yen and hong kong dollar  .  
 ok  do you have the relevant materials  ?  
 it 's correct  .  is there any way i can change it back before i leave the country  ?  
 that 's wonderful news  thanks for all your help  .  
 hello  .  i 'd like to send 600 rib in cash to my daughter  .  how long will it take for her to receive the money  ?  
 i can do that for you  .  could i see the remittance slip  ?  
 yes  that 's right  .  
 right  .  i 'd like to deposit 2000 rib into my current account  .  
 yes  please  .  70000 us dollars is being transferred into our account  .  
 you have an account with us  right  ?  if so  there should n't be any problem  .  
 i 've just had some money sent from germany  in euros  .  
 i 've lost my traveller 's cheques  all of them  .  
 ah  hello  .  do you have a service for buying traveller 's cheques  ?  
 we usually recommend our clients buy us dollar traveller 's cheques  as they can be exchanged for local currency all over the world  .  they are certainly the most versatile  .  
 but what if something happened to them  ?  what would happen to my money  ?  
 i think just 3000 rib will be enough  .  
 you mean  if there is any left over  ?  
 nope  .  that 's everything  thanks  .  
 i need to have some money transferred from the uk  from my company  .  it 's kind of an emergency  .  
 yes  .  here 's my card  .  do you need my id  ?  
 yes  yes  .  it seems that everything is settled  .  
 yes  .  and if you already have a current account with us  the insurance premium can be paid through it  which saves all of us a lot of hassle  .  
 it 's actually a deposit account that links to your margin account  the one you have with the securities company  .  you can transfer the money you have in your account into your fund account  .  
 how can i do that  ?  
 you can use your deposit book or your credit card  .  and of course  you can use our ebanking  .  
 yes  .  is that necessary  ?  
 that was a wise decision  if i may say so  .  our personal internet banking service offers online shopping transactions  payment of household bills online  account management  .  .  .  
 good morning  .  i have a bill of exchange against bank acceptance here  .  i 'd like to discount it  .  is that possible here  ?  
 do you have a copy of the id card of the person who took care of the legal aspects of this  ?  the legal rep  i mean  ?  we also need the loan certificate as well  .  do you have that  ?  
 no problem  .  could i please see the bill and all of the other documents  ?  
 yes  .  do you know what type of checking account you would like to open  business or personal  ?  
 not a problem  sir  .  if you 'd just fill out these forms  and of course with necessary clearance  we can get you the money right away  .  
 yes  .  i hope you can help  .  i 'm interested in obtaining a working capital loan  .  so  i was wondering what you offer here  ?  do you have various types  ?  
 well  we have no problems with our credit rating  i can assure you  .  
 that seems like a good idea  it 's for wages  you see  .  
 ok  just a moment  .  .  .  yes  it has arrived  .  the amount is 51998 us dollars net  12 us dollars has been deducted by the intermediary bank  .  
 in what denominations  ?  
 i see  .  so  i need to stamp it  .  and sign it too  ?  
 i would recommend it  yes  .  then you just need to complete that form  .  
 really  ?  have you checked everything carefully  ?  
 very carefully  that 's when i found the problem  .  
 the interest on this new account is higher than any of the accounts in our personal financing  .  
 that sounds better  .  also  can i use the one card for several accounts  ?  say  if i have two or three accounts and want to transfer money from one to the other  ?  
 right again  .  we can provide a tailored consultation service for you  giving you the latest quotes from the stock exchange and help you to plan what exactly you do with your investments  .  
 i see  .  what is it exactly that you are interested in  ?  
 that 's no trouble  sir  .  
 for every transaction you make  a statement will be drawn up and can be posted to you or sent via email  or if you want to be double sure we can do both  .  
 hi  .  i 've been sent over from turner interiors  .  they said i need to collect some sort of l  c  ?  do you have it  ?  
 well  i 've been very busy recently and i 'm having trouble keeping up to date with everything  so i just wondered what exact service you offer  .  
 how would i go about applying for this service  ?  
 really  ?  in that case  could i have the number of the service centre please  ?  
 of course  .  it 's 33234  .  that will put you in touch with a personal banker  .  
 that 's the beauty of the service  they can deal with everything  with total security  .  
 could you tell me more  ?  
 of course  .  financing link is a valueadded service  and can be tailored to suit your requirements  .  
 so  i can choose exactly what services i require  ?  that 's brilliant  .  can i use the card if i 'm overseas to withdraw my daily expenses  ?  
 i 'm from lexington software and i 'm here to collect an export l  c  .  
 no  you can take it away now  .  i just need you to sign here  .  
 b  miao eng  !  i 'd know that voice anywhere  .  what can i do for you  ?  any problems  ?  
 what do you recommend we do  ?  
 that 's it  !  all of them have firstclass quality and performance  .  besides  we adopt advanced technology  .  now we have developed new products  .  they are much better than what you have bought  .  
 what  ?  where does that five come from  ?  
 oh  it 's a service charge  .  
 sorry  but we ca n't do that  .  it 's store 's rule  .  
 certainly  .  just make them out to national bank  and sign and date them  .  
 please fill out this deposit form  first  .  
 yes  i do  .  here it is  and the cash  .  
 that 's good  .  is there anything else  ?  
 yes  our delivery fee could be waived  if you make an order of 50 units or more  .  we would have to insist on the annual contract  however  .  i understand it 's not the most convenient for you  .  perhaps we could shorten it to a sixth month contract if you are willing to take a lower rebate  .  
 it 's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms  .  they reached us two weeks ago  and were immediately examined after they arrived  .  to our astonishment  about 20  of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms  .  we ca n't accept them in this state  .  they are unfit for human consumption  .  and the medical officer of health has issued a stop notice on them  .  
 the mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags  sixty of these bags to a carton  .  it is stated on the surveyor  ?  s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact  .  so it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing  .  
 the rate was 1 australia dollar to 6 . 5 yuan yesterday  .  
 thank you very much  .  
 your price is reasonable but i wonder if you would give us a discount  .  you know for the products like yours we usually get 2  or 3  discount from european suppliers  .  
 that  s great  .  i  m glad we  ll be able to do business together  .  i  ll have some quotes ready for you by tomorrow morning  .  
 why  your price has soared  .  it  s almost 25  higher than last year  s  .  it would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price  .  
 there  s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses  .  that  s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones  .  to be frank with you  if it were not for the long  standing relationship between us  we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price  .  
 ok  .  how about the earliest possible shipment  ?  
 by the coming september  .  
 certainly  !  
 the iranians will give us a 10  discount if such a high order is placed with them  .  no doubt you know an incentive discount encourages the buyers and helps expand seller 's business  .  
 of course i know  .  but there is too high a rate  .  frankly speaking  the maximum discount we can make is 6   .  
 i see  .  how do you control the quality  ?  
 it  s much larger than i expected  .  when was the plant set up  ?  
 how many employees do you have in this plant  ?  
 that  s our latest development  .  a product with high performance  .  we put it on the market just two months ago  .  
 certainly  .  no one can match us as far as speed is concerned  .  
 you 've had a good trip  i hope  .  
 thank you  .  
 that is the result of our hard work  .  well  what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then  ?  
 oh  yes  .  we will give you a 5  commission on every transaction  .  
 if that 's the case  there 's not much point in further discussion  .  we might as well call the whole deal off  .  
 how about tomorrow morning at 9  ?  
 good  .  i 'll come back tomorrow  and we can then discuss it more specifically  .  
 i 'll come to that  .  my proposal is 
 well  as i  ve said  if your order is large enough  we  re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent  .  
 very well  i will  .  
 so do we  .  certainly it 's a step forward on your side  .  but the gap is still too wide  .  
 that wo n't do  .  you see  our profit margin is very narrow  .  it simply ca n't stand such a big cut  .  
 i hate to disappoint you  mr  .  brown  but if that 's the case  we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere  .  do think it over  please  .  we sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion  .  
 not too good  i 'm sorry  .  
 i 'm afraid i ca n't wait that long  .  can your office at least provide me with a ballpark figure  ?  
 that  my dear  was classic sales technique delivered by a professional  .  
 well  as you probably know i buy from a selected group of suppliers and do n't  as a rule  deal with new people  .  
 no problem at all  mike  .  just give me the chance  .  
 i can check that for you right now  .  would you mind holding  ?  
 okay  have you made a wire transfer at our bank before  ?  
 oh  that  s such a relief  .  i didn  t want the payment to be overdue  .  thank you so much  .  
 oh  thanks  .  mmm  hmm  creamy texture  very smooth  .  .  .  
 but you 'll have 90 days to pay your bill and i 'll tell you what  .  .  .  i 'll also throw in the discount of 10  on your up front deposit  .  
 done  .  .  .  
 i think my husband has some  .  
 that  s true  .  if something happened to my husband  i might lose everything  .  both of us have to work to keep our home  car  and our children  s education  .  i can  t afford that by myself  .  
 well  i suggest you just keep me posted . that should do it . that way the burden is on me to decide when to buy  not you  .  
 so it 's like you want me to be your eyes and ears into the industry  .  i can do that  provided the company i 'm working for is n't hurt  .  
 i see  .  could you make an exception and accept d  a or d  p  ?  
 well  mrs  .  wang  you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of cred it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er 's guarantee  .  we always require l  c for our exports  .  and the other way round  we pay by l  c for our imports  .  
 we 're getting ready to place our christmas orders and we need to know about how much it 's going to run this year . you know  so we can have the funds put aside  .  
 yeah  i 'm afraid so  .  i really need your help here  .  
 as to packaging  we 'll pack them two dozens to one carton  gross weight about 25 kilos a carton  .  
 could you use wooden cases instead  ?  
 that 's right  .  as soon as i get home  i 'll see about the opening of the letter of credit  .  
 that 'll be fine  .  i appreciate your cooperation  .  
 ok  i 'll show you how the packing is like  .  we have a showroom on the ground floor  .  let 's go downstairs and have a look  .  
 oh  the packing looks very nice  .  
 perhaps  .  general opinion is that the rear carrier should be offered as an extra  .  
 why not  ?  our cannedlichee and canned provisions have already been widely sold in various markets abroad  and the ma ling label has now been accepted by most of overseas customers and importers  .  is it quite impossible for you to use the ma ling labels as they are  ?  
 i 'd be quite willing to if i could  but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law  or we ca n't clear the consignment of lichee through the customs  .  
 what about the outer packing  ?  
 the cartons are comparatively light  and therefore easy to handle  .  they wo n't be stowed away with the heavy cargo  .  the stevedores will see to that  .  besides  we 'll reinforce the cartons with straps  .  silk blouses are not fragile goods  .  they can stand a lot of jolting  .  
 maybe you are right  but the goods are to be transhipped at hamburg or london  .  if the boxes are moved about on an open wharf  the dampness or rain may get into them  .  this would make the blouses spotted or ruined  .  
 i 'm sorry  but we ca n't take on any responsibility that is beyond our functions and powers  .  we 'll make sure that the packing is seaworthy  but we ca n't commit ourselves to being responsible for every kind of mishap  .  
 you may take it from me that the last thing we want to do is to disappoint an old customer like you  .  but the fact remains that our manufacturers have a heavy backlog on their hands  .  
 that seems a bit unstable don  t you think  ?  
 i  ve been thinking of doing that lately  !  i don  t want some banker to run off with my money  !  
 it sounds all right to me  but i will have to think about it  .  i 'll give you a definite answer tomorrow  .  if i choose seattle  will it be possible for you to ship the goods by the end of march  ?  
 i see  .  so let me get this straight  .  if i borrow let  s say  ten thousand dollars  how much will i have to pay each month  ?  
 oh  i see  .  that  s fine  .  what is the advantage of having higher deductibles  ?  
 hello  yes  i  d like to open a bank account  .  
 alright  then  with this chequing account you  ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book  .  will you require overdraft protection  ?  there is an extra fee for that  .  
 please fill in the slip  stating the exact amount you wish to withdraw  .  
 oh  yes  .  here it is  .  
 wait a minute  please  .  .  .  here 's the cash  .  
 which account would you like to open  ?  
 it is 3 . 2   .  you may earn a little interest on money  .  
 is there any minimum deposit for the first time  ?  
 ok  .  here you are  .  
 actually  i want to buy some traveler 's checks  .  
 of course  we 'd be happy to cash it for you  .  
 the service charge is 1  of the total amount of the check  .  
 sorry  sir  .  we ca n't cash the checks for you without your passport  .  
 thank you  .  and what amounts do you want the checks in  ?  
 i need some us dollars  .  
 what kind of currency have you got  ?  
 minus the fee  .  here are your dollars  .  please sign here  .  
 sure  .  do you have a minute  ?  why do n't you have a seat and let me show you how to operate this item  ?  
 how amazing  !  i have never seen it before  .  is it expensive  ?  
 ok  i will take one  .  
 we can discuss them detailedly over the meeting and choose the best way to promote our key products  .  
 i sometimes use traveller  s cheques  but sometimes i travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash  .  
 do you use your bank to pay your utility bills  ?  i use direct debit  .  
 that  s great  .  but i prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain  .  
  800  .  
 why do n't you send it by mail payment order  ?  
 sure  .  you can have a telegraphic or a swift transfer  .  
 and how long do those take  ?  
 both a telegraphic transfer and a swift transfer will normally be credited to the payee 's account within three or four working days  depending on whether the beneficiary 's bank is among our correspondent banks or we have to route the transfer through a third bank  .  
 oh yes  .  i 've got it written down here  .  just a minute  .  
 sure  .  how much would you like to change  ?  
 it is  .  our customers really like it  .  do you have any other questions about your new accounts  ?  
 then the difference between the asking price and the offering price is  2  .  it 's hard to take place today  .  
 would you like a savings or a chequing account  ?  
 right . could you fill out this form please  ?  
 is there any service charge  ?  
 it 's been a long time  has n't it  ?  how are you  ?  
 hello  miss wu  .  
 let me just make sure  .  you want to withdraw one thousand dollars  ?  
 let me see  .  i think maybe 600 usd at least  .  
 six hundred us dollars  .  
 yes  i would have to agree with you  .  it seems to offer more options than the others  .  but new product sometimes has a few troubles  .  how about yours  ?  
 any of our new products shall go through a 13 month testing period  .  
 your satisfaction is guaranteed  or we refund your money  .  
 you will receive the tender notice next month and you 'll find the information  .  
 ok  !  our company is very interested in the tender  .  i am sure that we will do our best to win the bidding in building the factory  .  
 good morning  .  i want to deposit a sum of money into my account  .  
 well  i want to deposit 2000 yuan into my account  .  
 would you please fill in a deposit form first  ?  please write down your name  your account number and the amount you want to put in  .  
 sure  .  how do you want it  ?  
 all right  .  here are the traveler 's checks and money  .  
 here you are  .  what is the rate  ?  
 hello  .  i 'm sorry to tell you that i 've lost my credit card this morning  .  i want to report the loss and replace a card  .  
 please pay 10 yuan  the handling charge  .  
 all right  .  i  ll open one of those  .  
 i want the one with the highest interest rate  .  
 that  s true  .  well  how much do you think i should get  ?  
 i am sorry to say it 's not on the way  but during loading  .  the tins inside the cases were broken evidently through rough handling  .  
 could you offer us a certificate issued by your health department  ?  
 seriously  .  the only tax i don  t mind them taking is social security  .  it  s only a few dollars every paycheck  .  
 thank you  .  actually  i could not believe it at first  .  you know  there 're so many outstanding people in our company  .  many of them are qualified to fill that position  .  
 so by then  you 'll be in charge of the whole department  .  
 yes  i  d like to deposit one billion dollars  .

 slide your card into the machine  .

 that  s fine  .  
 that  s all for today  .  
 i sometimes use traveller 's cheques  but sometimes i travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash  .  
 yes  .  my bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage  .  there  s a lot of competition between banks nowadays  .  each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others  .  
 not quite  .  you have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars  .  and sometimes the bank has service charges  .  but you don  t have to worry about that yet  .  let  s go make your first depot 
 ten percent  !  now that  s hefty  !  
 here you are mr  .  lee  .  will there be anything else  ?  
 i see  .  well for this amount i will have to get my manager  s approval  .  
 i do n't want you to misunderstand  miss briggs . we are very serious about hiring you  .  we want you to teach for us . we usually do contracts this way because it is more convenient  .  
 good  .  and your benefits will begin immediately  .  
 so  for now  you want me to keep a copy of the contract . but we wo n't sign it yet  .  that right  ?  
 so it 's the subjective criteria like team building and colleague support that you find hard  ?  
 great idea  .  and after all  that 's the whole point of an evaluation  .  i almost ca n't wait to give it a try  .  
 please put your name and address here  .  may i see your passport  .  
 yes  .  
 honestly  the flexible hours were the main attraction for me  .  the traditional working day does n't fit in with me lifestyle  i love being able to tailor my working hours  .  
 our monthly interest is 1 . 5  of the outstanding balance  .  would you please fill out the application the form  ?  
 really  ?  that 's great that you found a school that puts your need first  .  
 we ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained  .  
 that seems very impressive  .  good work  !  
 yes  i see that here  .  .  .  continuing education for the it department  a time management course for accounting  and team building for sales  .  anything planned for hr  ?  
 a holiday  i hope  !  no  really  we are looking into some courses on motivational techniques  .  we 'll add them to the list when we choose a lecturer  .  
 and  as well as being a pleasure to work with  you  ve been instrumental in helping us complete many key projects  .  
 my feelings are mixed on the issue too  .  by helping you i  m losing a valuable and trusted employee  .  however i think you are taking a step in the right direction  .  
 yes  it does  .  
 can you give me the specifics  ?  
 your monthly gross salary will increase by  500  .  
 that sounds fair  .  
 all right  .  in that case we are still willing to do business with you  .  
 yes  .  actually  both accounts come with cards that you can use in atm machines  so that you wo n't have to come in to the bank to make a transaction  .  
 thank you very much  .  
 well  .  obviously  you won  t want all risks cover  .  
 that 's right  .  on the other hand  a wa policy covers you against partial loss in all cases  .  
 oh  lots of them  .  for instance  war risks  tend and sicc  .  
 are you going to make an offer today  ?
