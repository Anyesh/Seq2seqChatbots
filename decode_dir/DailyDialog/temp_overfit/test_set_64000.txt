he is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
i think so too . he 's also very good at making the company .
i 'm not sure . he 's a bit bossy but i 'm sure he 's in a bit of a rough neighborhood .
that 's right . he is so funny and humorous .
you 're right . she s a fitness expert .
i guess so . i ended up finding out later that night when i saw her in the car .
i do n't think she 's very shy .
it 's complicated . but basically it boils down to one thing . this company is downsizing and i ca n't continue working for a company that may let me go .

that 's true .
would you care for a drink before you order ?

why do i have to pay duty on this card ?
if the cause is poverty there should be a programme to check and see the pyramids .
you did n't watch the end of the auction ?
i know . but it 's a deal .
i just want to think of something else .
my mom just wants to take care of everything and i really want to be a fourteen for the day .
i 'm sorry but i 'll take you to the station .
i thought it was too dull . i 'm too .

haha . . . so what are you going to do with her ?
when did it happen ?
cool down harry ! what are you really mad about ? did you get ripped off ?
yes . last sunday i went to a nearby market . it was on <unk> fair . i chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot without even trying to strike a bargain . and it was on the original condition of the original condition of the original condition and bought the original condition of the original condition and bought the original condition of the original condition of the original condition of the original condition .
is that so ? i 'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . it 's the norm of free trade . the seller sets
but do you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?
of course that 's something really irritation . and the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . i recommend you to consult the price tags in the superb
well then let 's go and have a look .
i wo n't be back so early .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too much fast food and that food is very fattening .
you see we are not familiar with the rules and the following name of your company .
no this has been a glass of days .
i go to bed at ten and get up at six .
that 's helpful for your health .
i know . but things have different ways of getting a little more quickly .
yes and i have already seen one of those things .
no . is that why you did n't listen to her ?
oh i 'm sorry .
are you going to cook it tonight ?
yeah you re right . i ll get a fax and ask you to help me .
do you want me to buy something ?
i m sorry but he s not in right now . can i take a message ?
sure . can you have her call me back on my cell phone number ?
she s my pleasure . i ll see you on thursday .
you mean the large one or the small one ?
i want to change the ticket .
i 'll have a look .
would you mind if i helped out in the kitchen instead ? i do enjoy cooking .
this is supposed to be your vacation we 'd like you to just relax .
cooking makes me feel relaxed . so what are we cooking ?
ok well we 're going to make a pan of lasagne a salad and some garlic bread . here 's the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?
no let 's just put some fruit and vegetables outside the door please .
that 's a good idea . can you set the oven to 200 degrees celsius ?
that 's a bit high for lasagne . i 'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there .
fine . i 'll just get out the casserole dish the <unk> the salad bowl and the baking sheet .
you know i could do this myself . why do n't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ?
i do n't think it 's broken .
can you do something about it ?
fine . i 'll go vacuum . let me know if you need any other help .
yes . turn right when you come to the second traffic and turn right .
where do i get off ?
the next bus will be here in four minutes .
thank you .
ok . i ll get your number for you .
thank you very much !
it 's a fortyfive minute to an hour ride .
thank you very much !
you re welcome .
of course . is the dinner still on ?
yes i was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .
we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .
that 's what i thought you would do . listen i live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . it 's just down the street from all the bars . you probably do n't want to be walking around after dark .
it ca n't be that bad .
but it is ! take this morning for example . the subway was so packed this morning i got totally squished by about a hundred busy <unk> on the way to work .
really ? i never would have guessed . the criminals must only come out in the evenings because i 've never noticed anything strange when i 've been at your house in the daytime .
the show is in the e building .
ok we will . how do you get around in the evenings ?
when i first moved in i walked everywhere . but within a week i had my purse stolen just a block away from the police station ! now i always take public transportation .
has anything else happened to you ?
nothing else has happened to me but i have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close .
well we 'll be careful . thanks for letting me know .
yes . i 've been through a lot today .
are there many accidents in the city every day ?
you are right .
i 'll tell you what .
any other ideas ?
i hope it will be .
it was my pleasure .
have n't i been able to sleep lately ?
hi i m just doing my work .
i have a flashlight in my closet .
what was the problem ?
i believe that two people did get hurt .
yeah . i heard he has been there .
i 'm sorry but the whole terrible is n't .
so what did you do about it ?
i do n't know . maybe they 're really crazy .
speaking . may i ask where to go ?
where are you heading sir ?
are you in a hurry ?
good choice !
i 'll be there in a minute .
i 'd like to get there on time .
no problem . do n't worry the taxi is faster than the bus .
you 're kidding !
you know i hate shopping more than anything else in this world .
i know . but we could get some exercise in and we could get some errands run too . windowshopping won t cost you anything .
what kind of errands do we need to run ?
you need to make one more choice .
i 'll only go if we can stop at the to pick up something to drink for tonight .
why do n't we go drink at the restaurant ? i do n't want to play poker .
sounds good . you have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . i know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms especially if the stores have special offers .
i promise . we re only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven t had time for .
ok let 's go !
wait a minute . let 's go !
i do n't have any cash on me .
well i want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday .

thank you ma 'am . it 's been a pleasure doing business with you .
i 'd like to buy a new mobile phone please .

they 're fine but i prefer chinese ones .
i do n't know . if you could try it on .

thank you .
the popular tour of the season is a 14 days sightseeing to venice . are you interested in that city ?
i see . do you have your card ?
from code 513 4326748 .
yes .
cindy you say hi .
um yes . i 'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni olives and extra cheese .
my name is judy wang .
thank you . i 'm susan heywood .
hello hong .
wow what a good idea . i did n't know you had a good time .
i 'm on route 80 a few miles east of the university of utah .
so you have to be more careful .
it 's red .
good . thank you very much .
one of those ?
i 'm afraid she 's fully booked .
oh is it ?
double room ?
this is mr . white speaking .
ok are you checking out tomorrow ?
yes . here is my card .
ok . thank you .
because i m not in the mood that s why .
well don t just sit there do something . come and help me in the kitchen .
help you in the kitchen i don t feel like it .
would you like to clear the table then ?
really ? do i have to do it ?
not if you don t want to .
really it 's so beautiful .
well thank you very much .
you must n't pick it in this place .
you 're right .
it s under the couch .
yes i 'd like to have a look .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
why not ?
because i don t think my husband would like it . thank you for inviting me anyway .
i 'm sorry . i ca n't .
it says no smoking .
sorry i 'm very near sighted .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do it again .
try to be more careful in future .
what ? i thought it was .
it says smoking is not allowed in any private offices . it might be the most terrible thing for you .
i am not surprised you eat too much .
and i suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office does n't help .
no i would n't think so .
i do wish i could lose weight .
well why do n't you go on the diet ?
i 've tried diets before but they 've never worked .
they 've really had great taste .
yes maybe i should .
that is just an excuse . you can always find some time to exercise .
but i work hard all the time for long hours . often i have no time for lunch . yet i am still getting fatter .
bill you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . and skipping meals will not help you lose weight . in fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals .
i know you 're right but what can i do ?
a lot of things are n't fair . that 's life .
but i 'll miss the news . it s important in my business to keep up with events in china .
i know i know . have you got a portable radio ? you can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time .
that 's a good idea !
just some water please . do you take some fruit and vegetables ?
thank you .
i like the kitchen . it is a little too cool for me .
2 pork chops and beef .
that 's right .
okay . i ll have them brought to you .
yes . honey . we have a nice day .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
well i swim and run every day .
now tell me what do you eat ?
well i do n't eat any meat but i do eat fish and eggs .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
oh yes and fruit i love fruit .
what do you drink ?
well i never drink alcohol coffee or tea .
what do you drink ?
you too . have you lost some weight ?
yes i took off 4 kilos . i am glad you notice it .
you are not late ?
no no no i just changed my eating habits . i eat a balance meal . and i eat less than before .
sounds reasonable .
ah yes that 's cool . what 's this ?
yes this is .
ah that 's susan .
do you have the same model as paying ?
all right . thank you very much .
no thanks . i 've had enough .
actually you have n't have much .
to tell you the truth i am on the diet .
that sounds ridiculous . why ?
well i am gaining weight these days and i have to watch my calories .
no do n't try to tend me . i 'm becoming chubby and i have to slender down .
you are not really chubby . you are actually thin enough .
i do n't think so . i know i 've put on weight this winter .
so you are watching your weight are n't you ?
yes to tell you the truth . i am on the diet .
where are you heading now ?
i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road . it is very close to your house .
is that the university next to the teachers college ?
that 's the one .
you mean we 'll share the taxi ?
yeah . if we share the cab it 'll be cheaper . besides that your chinese is better than mine . the drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though i practice my pronunciation carefully .
well . do n't worry about it i will be happy to share the taxi with you .
take me to the airport please .
are you in a hurry ?
you bet . i was supposed to call my mother an hour ago .

i 'll do my best .
here 's twenty dollars .
ok . here 's your change .

here is your receipt . thank you .
yes they all stop at this corner .
how long do you expect me to go there ?
you can take any bus except the number 9 .
well i do n't want to miss my friend .
they run about every five minutes .
fine . how long does it take to get to 82nd street ?
it 's about two miles away . that 'll be about 15 minutes .
yes i am . i arrived only three days ago from japan .
how do you like new york city ?
i like it very much but it 's a little confusing to me .
you 'll soon get accustomed to it . it 's not difficult . well here 's the bus . fortunately it 's not full .
thank you for the information .
you re welcome .
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .

yes . i caught a number 7 bus yesterday and they said i had taken a wrong bus .
thank you henry . i 'll get a number 13 .

well there s nothing we can t handle . i ll spray the and walls to get rid of the cockroaches but the termites will be harder to get rid of . we will have to cover the entire house and it . unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days .

well rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run please sit down . coffee ?

haha i could never do that . i d be a zombie if i didn t have my morning coffee fix . let s get down to business then .
yes . i ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . the demand for phone cameras is growing and pear has been falling behind in the market .
that s great ! i m glad to hear that pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . is pear still interested in having those ?
no we re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . we were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
surely . let s get started by drafting a new contract .

show me some classic high heels please .
ok right this way . what color did you have in mind ?
black .
of course . we ve got this style here that is very popular . because it s an opentoe shoe you can wear it any time of the year . they look great on everyone .
umm . too shiny . and i wear pantyhose with my shoes so let s look for a <unk> shoe .
ok these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a twoinch heel so they are very comfortable .
i don t like the pointed toes . let me take a look at what else you have . too high . that one looks like the back would cut into my heel . i have a high instep so i doubt that one will fit properly . i don t want . those might as well be . ah finally this is what i m looking for .
what size ?
size five .
do you own your own ?
hmmm . not good . they re too tight . the length is right but the shoe is too narrow and it s pinching my toes . and there d be no room for my . you know what ? i don t think i have the patience for this today . they just don t make shoes like they used to . i ll come back another time .
have a nice day ma am .
oh my cat likes that in the <unk> house .
who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
the house 's a bit under a lot of money . we had a few problems with the old house .
what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus our apartment is too small for that <unk> of dog .
ok . how about we get a cat or a ?
we re planning on having children soon i don t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
fine ! let s get a bird then ! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! a parrot would be awesome !
i ll tell you what i can get you some hamsters and we ll take it from there .
<unk> !
well since we are getting up so late i decided to make a big breakfast !

oh yeah ? tell me then smarty pants how will you go about setting up your garden ?
well first i need to buy some things such as fertilizer seeds and tools .
what type of tools ?
you know the basics . a shovel spade and a hoe .

i 'll give you a call .
i am going to change some money .
good luck to you .

i think it 's a very useful job .
what price would you like for a la cane ?
i was not aware of that .
yes i think that is great !
well off the record of course but i hear that he 's got terrible debts . he has his own company and it 's not going very well .
i 'll keep that in mind .
i really want to get in touch with my new carpet .
i m already in a hurry .
we are trying to buy a copy of the whole wheat bread and some fresh fruit .
what ? are you serious ?
do you like to get a motorcycle or a cat ?

i 've heard that when this happens it 's important to save energy .
okay sir . .
what was it ?
i might not agree with you .
i m happy to hear you say that .
what are your plans now that you re getting out ?
the rent is 1500 per month .
that s way too much .
it s absolutely free on tuesday .

that s the lowest price i can offer .
this is a very expensive brand .
it s going to be a problem .
i can live with that .
okay mr . horn see you tomorrow at 1030 .
a lot of things are prohibited to take on the plane ?
i had a home inspection before but didn t really understand it .
a lot of things are prohibited to take on the plane ?
sorry to hear that . but i just thought the new year was coming .
i think you should not tell me the real reason for having an overdraft .
i can solve it by the president .
i need to contact the sellers with your current employer .
no thank you !
the house has a very outdated electrical system . many of the switches and outlets do not work and are unsafe .
at the earliest possible time to leave directly to your hotel . is that right ?
wow ! what time is the date ?
you may put it here in the cupboard or leave it as long as you will catch the keys on the side of the plane .
i want to paint the walls right away and get the carpet cleaned .

yes . which one is the brake again ?
the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas .
i m glad this car is an automatic . i do n't like having to change gears .
automatics are very simple to drive . the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver s seat !
what s the problem ?
i can t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . could you move it forward a bit please ?
how s that ?
that s better . now what ?
check your petrol situation .
the tank is almost empty . i guess i ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up .
that s a good idea . put your keys in the ignition start it up put the car in reserve wait for the road to be clear and then back out of the .
i got it . don t worry . i ll get you there in one piece .
remember no honking this time . the horn is only for emergencies !
why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ?

yeah i know . shop till you drop .
ok .
and that 's it . you 're done .
ok .

eyes you sent them to new york right ?
that 's right . i thought i 'd come back to buy a few more souvenirs .
you want some souvenirs !
well first i 'd like to buy a few postcards . my sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . i want to do that too .
we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . the same designs can be found on these posters .
posters are difficult to travel with . i think i 'll just buy the postcards . i heard that you might also have some of the <unk> that are made in venice .
yes we do . they 're on the wall behind you .
how much do they cost ?
the prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask . would you like me to get one down for you to look at ?
yes i think i 'd like the green mask in the middle .
all right . this way please .
thank you .
are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift ?
it 's my girlfriend 's birthday today and she loves chocolate .
we 've got plenty to choose from here .
they look delicious . i think she 'll be pleased .
it 's a good idea .
i guess you won t be able to purchase these items today .
i do n't know what happened to me . i just lost it .
thank you ! this is perfect for you !
do you really want to bet ?
no i 'm not .
that 's not the only thing you can do .
i see .

sorry but he 's busy then too .
yes a little .
yeah .
i like it .
well i really like being with you .
ok . i 'll be right back .
i guess we can wait for the next bus to come back .
perhaps you have the right to say that .
i do n't think he 'll be be be be be be be be be better .
what 's so great about it ?
what do you mean ? it 's a scrim .
not to me i would n't be caught dead in that .
i love that kind of stuff .
yeah you seem to like those styles .
sure do . i get a kick out of looking <unk> .
this one looks really expensive though .
i do n't care how much it costs . i 'm rolling in it .
lucky you ! i ca n't buy anything else . i 'm flat broke .
i got a replace my party outfit i trashed it last week .
why did you drag me into this ? i 've spent a week salary .

just joking t . i 've got some wonderful clothes . let 's go and have a close look at your outfit .
you can buy the bubble wrap here but you ll have to stand in line over here to post your package .
that s a really long line . how long do you think it ll take to get through all those people ?
it takes about 3 minutes per person so it ll probably be about an hour s wait .
can i buy stamps here ?
sure . how many would you like ?
i need 30 for my christmas cards .
are you sending them abroad ?
twenty of them are going abroad to china and america .
some chinese schools are indeed <unk> to visit them . i do n't think they should have a choice do anything to do with the staff .
well i am afraid i do n't bring my passport with me today . can you save it for us until tomorrow ?
oh i 'm sorry .
and the bubble wrap ?
that s another .
and which child is this ?
i 'd like to two roast beef sandwiches and one fruit salad please .
well this way please . what 's your problem ?
she usually does n't wear anything but a few drops of chanel no . 5 . but i 'd like to buy her a new fragrance .
ok here are some of our most popular perfumes .
which one would you recommend ?
personally i quite like the new perfume from clinique . it 's a subtle flowery scent . what do you think ?
that smells great . i 'll take one bottle please .
would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
it 's ok . she normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder and i do n't know what shade to buy .
how about some lipstick ? every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick .
she does n't usually wear lipstick . she thinks it makes her nose look too big .
how about some mascara ? that will make her eyes look bigger .
good idea . she s a teacher of aerobics .
i know what she would whitening cream .
you do n't have to be so happy .
will that be all then ?
that 's everything .
yeah i 'm glad that we did n't have to wait long . i 'm starving !
let 's take a look at the menu so we can order . do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?
what would you rather have samosas or poppadoms ?
i heard that one of their specialities is the .
so you think that 's one of the family who are in the <unk> ?
sounds good . what are you going to have to eat ?
i think i might have a dahl .
what 's in a dahl ?
it 's got and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .
so you have to celebrate it ?
ok . how about some lamb kebabs ?
that 's my favourite . do you want to have some wine or beer ?
i think i 'll have a beer .
ok shall i flag down the waitress ?
i would n't recommend it . i think we should wait until she comes round .
you 're right . that might seem a bit rude . it 's a good thing i 've got you with me !
what would you do without me ?
sure . that 's cut back to me .
i want to try a new size .
i would like the chicken !
let 's see . what 's the charge for that ?
you have a great taste .
no but i think the acting is favorable .
no . these are .
i do n't know . . . i like to have a girlfriend .
i agree . people who do n't wear both of them .
the leopard print sounds good .
maybe we can wait for a moment .
yes . it s nice . can i try it on ?
sure when will the wedding begin ?
i 'd like that .
i want some chocolate .
well it 's probably nothing serious .
yeah right this machine will start you . remember ?
you also need to prepare formal clothes for the interview a suit should be the best .
i want to get some pie .
which would you like for your main course ?
yeah but you should have it yourself . you could also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
this is my first ! this is gonna be a very good drug !
and would you like to have some appetizer first ?
i would like that kind of vegetable .
yes .
i need to make sure that you get what you need . happy birthday !
ok .
certainly . i will take your word for it .

i see .
why are you in the mood for this chicken ?
no thanks . i 'd like to try that .
yes but i have a few clothes in my bag .
right . what about this one ?
it is necessary for me to wear the green dress .
no the best thing is that i 'm not familiar with all of them .
thank you . you 're right .
i have been having this long time .
i 've got to go . the place is too gross for me .
well let 's hit the whirlpool for a bit .
i think i can wash here at the moment .
of course if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank or open new accounts with you .
it 's my pleasure .
i have n't gotten my cv .
why do n't you wear it at home ?
why not ? what 's wrong with it ?
no the best you should do is get rid of them .
poor boys ! they are not gentle .
i 'm sure you have the right person .
i know that but my clothes are not good enough for me .
well i 'll have to go and get you a new one .
well to be honest i was n't thinking . what 's your favorite color ?
i do n't like to .
you re welcome .
it 's just a couple of minutes .
that 's too expensive .
i got on about two miles away .
i 'm sorry . the cable has n't been working .
yes by the way does i have to change trains ?
a lot of things are troubling me . i do n't know how to maintain a game of a more than a regular customers .
i think the slight pay decrease might be worth it .
are you kidding ? do n't you have a family ?
i do n't think so . you know many people in the movies are qualified for their group .
it was nice talking to you too .
you have good taste . it is very much in style this year .
it 's only thirty minutes to an hour .

it looks wonderful .
i saw a lot of television before i took up in the kids .

john the guy is playing computer .
he 's such a nice guy .
the end of this month .
so he took the wrong bus .
he loved his family and his freedom .
but if we get stuck in traffic jams when i m home .
she is also very naughty . by the way do you have a good time ?
he takes attendance once in the morning and once in a while .
yes .
oh i 'm sorry .
so he takes the next train to the station .
really ? have you ever won a prize before ?
i m looking for a sweater .
he is just a patient teacher .
what s your job ?
ok the next course starts on wednesday .
it s from the shower .
wait a minute . i 'll check it out .
can i help you ?

great . i ll be expecting you .
only four hours .
okay . thanks a lot .
no .
i 'd like to two roast beef sandwiches and one fruit salad please .
don t worry about that . it s probably of the stress you ve been under . just take some aspirin . combined with the stronger cough medicine it will make you feel very tired . you shouldn t work or use any equipment which requires concentration . if i were you i d just sleep read a book or watch tv
i have been up so hard .
here is your boarding pass .
do you have a fever ?
are you sure that this has nothing to do with sleep ?
yes i 'd like to buy a new mobile phone please .
these books over here are about ancient history . they might be helpful .
can i check this one out ?
i m sorry . it s for reference only so it must stay in the library . but you re welcome to look through it .
ok . and i d like to check these books out .
that s all you need to do .
i guess i have to go to the united states .
pretty good . where are you going ?
it was great . i had a good time . there was a lot of turbulence though .
yes . i took an hour ago .
i do n't know . but i like the novels .
that 's too bad . do you usually take a bath or a vacation ?
thank you . i was operated on for gastric ulcer .
what 's the weather like in new york ?
you should probably let it say around a week .
ok it wo n't be long . you will have to wait for two weeks .
great ! i 'll come back as soon as i get to the office .
what ?
do you think it 'll be better if you take the exam ?
what if i do n't have to figure it out ?
the rest of us will go if you have a good rest .
i have to study after graduation . i 'm in a hurry to get a job that would allow me to do the cleaning .
do you know any kind of sports ?
yeah i m getting too busy to work with the classes . i won t know how to play the game .
what s your greatest strength ?
not everyone is working . it seems that we have to cut down our brand 100 to make the same mistakes .
it s expensive .
that is a relief . we found a job and the title was in the world .
yeah i have to take the course that s why i m looking for a holiday . i won t let you go .
yes .
oh i love this job . it was a little confusing to me .
it was in the suburbs . it was founded in ottawa in chicago .
oh i learned that many languages have been the confidence in science and english .
more and more people have realized that violence on the <unk> day may lead to their hotel .
so tell me karl why you come all the way to minnesota to live ?
yes but i still think it 's too hard to find .
it 's really strange to see the advertisement you have to think in the foreign country . do you think it 's in the uk ?
well they stayed with us all the time .
i 'm sure the university was favorably impressed with that .
here we are miss .
well i think that 's because we have nothing to do about her .
it started yesterday .
you 're from asia to the united states .
honestly i think i ought to take up the issue of my own conversation with the language like that .
so you ve been through all this ?
actually more people have realized that violence on <unk> consumer is the biggest problem .
well i ve already been to most of the other nationalities . i think we have nothing to do .
i think you know the law of china has a great chance to practice english . you know the law class has n't done a lot of research yet . we are very interested in making this course .
yes i know . my bank is very important .
i have a great idea .
really well .
yes they did . but i got tired of all the time .
there are 10 frames in a bowling game .
i could n't understand . do you know where the rest of the service is ?
my favorite . i was n't very impressed with my favorite subjects .
you do n't have to work so hard .
yes i 've read them many times . i think it 's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters .
i can still remember our teacher this semester .
he was a very good employee .
what 's it john ?
he 's trying to be supportive but i can tell him that if you want an exam .
yes he has . he 's also an outstanding football player .
yeah . i got sick and tired of her nagging all the time .
if you 're not the one who can read and figure out what 's more i should tell you is interested in .
a tie ?
yes . there 's one way .
you 're right !
so if i go to the police station how long will it take to get the bag ?
nothing much . i 'm just relaxing today . why ? what 's going on ?
are you sick ? what are you taking ?
i have no idea where to go .
oh that 's great ! so you did n't get the new job and i told you to get the new job .
you 're probably right . if i 'm going to see a doctor .
is there anything i can do ?
okay . take it easy . i 'll give you a call .
i 'm from . i 'm going to the hospital to pick up my things up .
can you speak english ?
we are playing against hainan .
sorry i have no idea .
do you have any other questions about your new job ?
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
some people have shooting and action programs for the next year but people will find illegal for you to study more or too .
i see . by the way what shall i do when i start my job ?
well they are cheap and soft . i will take it .
have you ever been one of them ?
wow that 's a good idea . i do n't have to go to the gym anymore .
yeah . i love the beautiful scenery the exercise and the night air .
yes i agree . i like the writer 's language and i enjoy watching tv .
you 're so lucky !
nice to meet you lvan . my name is alike . i 'm from japan .
nice to meet you . i 'm from the united states .
a second language is always difficult .
true but english is harder than most . it s a crazy language .
a crazy language ? why do you say that ?
one letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .
no wonder you say english is a crazy language .
it was really busy .
i really appreciated it .
i have a driver 's course .
i see .
to be honest i like most of them except for my chinese teacher . she is quite young but her class is too boring !
i m sure he s just a shoulder to cry on right .
oh she s fine . she s getting started .
are you able to follow him ?
she 's in the hospital with my dad . i have to go back tonight .
how old is she ?
i ca n't remember but she was n't seriously hurt .
sometimes it takes a long time to find out something . it s not easy to worry about .
i guess so . she never tasted anything before .
and do you have some <unk> foods ?
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
what is that ? you re a mathematician !
i understand .
i m going to make sure and get my vote in .
no but she told me that she did n't want to be able to understand her .
oh come on ! i have to be there . just follow me .
i do n't know . but she said i know her way .
yes that 's right . if you are feeling ill just follow her in the moment .
she was a beautiful brown eyes .
you 've got to be joking . what did you do to make her own decisions ?
i guess i 'm a b . a . in economics .
you 're right . but she 's always busy .
i m thinking about ordering some special styles of perfume .
i ca n't decide whether to go with it .
no but i did n't mean to . . .
how did that happen ?
have you ever got the goods on her ?
well you have to be very careful with her .
no . they don t . i think they know where they want .
poor guy ! i asked you to give her a nose <unk> .
i do n't know . she 's a teacher in a <unk> .
really ? then i guess you ll have to stay there for another week .
no but i 'd like to see books .
oh . she 's nice of them .
the one with your friends in the office is known for its quality and best .
you ca n't help learning when you 're using it all day . you 'll see . a few weeks study in the school will have a similar effect on you .
i hope so . you see at the moment i find it difficult to get used to the teacher 's speed and accent . i 'm awfully worried i ca n't reply as quickly as she seems to expect .
oh she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use english throughout the class . she does n't mind your making mistakes though .
you know speaking in class is a very good chance to put your english to practical use .
that 's the new teacher .
thank you for your interest .
she 's very nice .
what does she teach ?
english of course .
is she your teacher ?
yes . she teaches our class three times a week .
can she speak chinese to her students ?
not very much .
it 's a good thing you can speak english !
yes i finished last friday .
you sound relieved .
well yes . i do n't mind admitting that i am . i enjoyed school but i did object to having to go in every day once we 've done all our exams .
well what are you going to do now ? have you made any plans ?
yes i intend to go to university . that ll be in september . but it all depends on my a level results .
why do you choose to quit your present job ?
oh yes .
five days a week too ?
actually five and a half . on saturday we have classes only in the morning .
gosh !
that 's too much for us really .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
when do you start school ?
i 'm going to register right now .
do you have your library card ?
hi sterling !
hi steven ! what are you doing ?
she 's very nice .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
to begin with i have to teach them .
i see .
parents have to go to school monday to get their approval .
but most of the chinese are the same .
i transferred from pcc .
does the school have to wear uniforms ?
i do n't know . but it 's a good way to save money .
that 's interesting .
we have one of our main reason . we don t have any money to buy . a monthly savings account but there are several . the money you have to pay part of the amount you have to pay each month .
there are hundreds and hundreds . english is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions .
can you give us an example ?
i 'll look up the rate . to look up does n't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . it means to search for and find some information .
what about the expression goodbye ? is that an idiom ?
that is just a natural grammatical english expression . it has a direct translation in other languages .
well i have got an english word . i would like to know english a language with a language .
i need to see if check number 212 has cleared yet .
you can always go to the bank .
i sure do .
thank you .
i have to take the bus .
yes .
and not expensive either .
you owe 235 . 13 in fees .
how much is the cancellation fee ?
oh . what s the weather like in new york ?
that s very nice of you .
i need to use the internet .
is there a problem ?
i have it right here .
you know ? i have to pay you back .
i want to have a few things in my country .

thank you .
i have it .
i 'm a clerk in a shop .

i d like to do that .
we 'll send you a receipt out tomorrow .
i d like to do that .
do you want to take any money out ?
are you all right ?
every option you can choose will appear on the screen . that s about it .
when will it be working again ?
i 'm not sure . but i 'll get a table ready as fast as i can .
i get it thank you very much .
do you need a spot here or off campus ?
i have both but i usually use my car to get to school .
but mine is a little expensive .
i am not sure what a handicapped spot is .
the handicapped logo with blue means that you are not to park there unless you have a handicapped permit . will you mostly be parking during the day or the night ?
i am going to the gym .
be careful about the time limits on the streets . have you seen the signs for time limits ?
no i have not seen the signs .
pay attention to what the signs tell you in terms of time limits and what days you can park there . do you know what the curb colors mean ?
what curb colors ?
just remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means loading and unloading only . i think you 'll be good to go !
you can send it to the person over there .
i 'm doing my job .
i want you to make an omelet so actually this is really silly i 've never made one before . how do you make an omelet ?
here 's my license .

why do you have to leave early ?
now that i think about it i have to be there . do you have any plans ?
you 'll find that out where we are at .
i 'm sorry . i ca n't imagine what to say .
i 'll ask you for some advice .

i do n't think i 'm doing a good job . my mother always encouraged me to do everything .
well i have to get the scholarship so i should be a little bit nervous .
we need to get a lot of things this time .
well done !
no problem . i have n't got a chance to go this .
unfortunately not . i 've done that and the work is n't good for me .
i want to two roast beef sandwiches and one fruit salad please .
well it 's a great school .
exactly . as you know that 's the first thing i need to do is to get more rest .
fine . if you need help just ask me .
what 's that ?

it was a good game was n't it ?
i do n't think much of the film .
i think it is the worst one i have ever seen .
oh i 'm not sure i agree with you . it was not a good one but it was not the worst one . actually it was n't too bad .
i ca n't think the same .

i could n't agree with you .
yes sir may i help you ?

yes . he s already got the passport and visa .

thank you . he s very lucky indeed .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
but i ruined your rug .
i just got it .
i m not interested in the winter . and i like the best part of my life .
the outlets usually give you great deals .
well you ca n't live without a band .
that is true .
yes you are lucky . how about you ?
you are right . the city is famous for its beautiful days and big enough for its beauty .
i 'm sick of it too .
the door bell does n't work there 's no hot water and the building is falling apart .
it 's no use complaining . if we had got enough money we could n't put up with it and would have moved out .
you 're not looking to be my shoes !
i m afraid i can t .
but you should avoid <unk> when you haven t got the real facts .
ok . i ll try my best to calm down first .
yes she is my favorite girl .
it s all right .
would you like to have dinner with me ?
i was in a comfortable place so really it s no problem . i am happy to see you . did the rain hold you up long ?
yes . when i came out of the subway it was raining cats and dogs . and i forgot my umbrella . so i had to wait for the rain to let up .
i totally understand .
well i had a terrible day yesterday .
poor girl !
not much except that my motherinlaw is driving me up the wall .
what 's the problem ?
i need help turning them on .
you 've got it . mary 's father 's mother better .
well last week i invited her over to dinner . my husband and i had no problem with the food but if you listened to her then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . there 's just nothing can please her .
no i ca n't see that happening . i know you 're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
it 's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .
my motherinlaw used to do the same thing to us . if it was n't disciplining them enough then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them the schools we sent them too and everything else under the sun .
what do you think is important to him ?
she asked me all sorts of questions . she asked if i smoked and whether i played sports she asked me where i went .
wait a minute you 've got a <unk> there . are you sure you lost your job ?
while you are getting back i 'll cook dinner and let you know how to get things done .
sure just leave me alone . i didn t know you re so excited .
i do n't think that it 's possible to move on to another time .
oh that sounds good . where did you get the desk ?
that s okay . you can make it .
we 're not going to be able to fix it .
that s out of the question . i could go to the gym like that .
i do n't know but i am really tired .
i see . thank you very much for your time .
i have to take a conference .
i do n't know . i just thought i 'd just drop in on him .
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
but he has to move over to you .
is there anything i can do for you ?
you 're kidding ! what 's he doing ?
if you believe me it or not i would get a laptop from the window .
i m sure you do miss that type of cooking . but can t you try to get used to western food ?
i have tried . but americans like butter bread sugar and cream too much .
i suppose you re right lee . maybe that s why so many westerners are overweight .
it s interesting that americans work very hard at their jobs do not take naps during the day and yet they can be so heavy .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too much fast food and that food is very fattening .
why don t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy being outside working during the day ?
what do you suggest ? i can t afford to quit my job until i get a new one .
maybe you have two choices . you could attend school during the day or you could get a position that provides training .
really it 's so beautiful .
well thank you very much .
you must n't pick it in this place .
you 're right .
it s under the couch .
what 's that ?
yes i 'd like to buy a new mobile phone please .
do you want to sign it here please ?
my husband has been here for a year .
he took the picture when he was in the library .
about 12 years ago .
what is the date today ?
no . don t bother .
thank you .
i agree . we could go to the zoo . i don t like animals either .
that 's too bad . they are more independent .
i know you love the oscars . this way i have some friends of them .
sorry i 'm very busy . i have to go to a class .
have you ever been drinking plenty of water ?
but you should avoid the fact that you should do the same thing .
no . i have some business to attend .
what does that mean ? i do n't know why .
i really need to ask you to come back for a little while .
you are free . i need you to do the drying up . i m almost finished the washing up . i m going to clean the cooker when i finish .
also we are going to the louvre museum . the eiffel tower is really beautiful !
i do n't know . well my contract here is for one year and i do n't know what i should do after that .
well have you ever thought about learning some chinese ?
actually i am learning that now . but it 's too hard for me . you know the four tones and the stuff . it really <unk> me out .
do n't worry . all things are difficult before they are easy .
you hit the nail right on the head .
well are you invested in some program ?
what is it ?
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
awesome . i 've been giving this a lot of thought . when can we do this ?
how about this sunday ?
ok cool .
good . i 'll give you a call tonight .
no problem .
please call if you have any other requests . your food will be delivered promptly .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
i will have to take care of the white house .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
i am not in the mood .
why are you feeling depressed ?
i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . it 's a real letdown .
i do n't think she would do such a thing .
but she did and it made me disappointed .
oh cheer up . a girlfriend is not everything .
but she means a lot to me .
then forgive her mistake .
oh . i just can t forget it .
have you ever been eating better ?
yeah i have . i called some important documents and text messages to you .
it 's about to keep going up the desk .
i heard that when you 're got a promotion .
because i am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !
yes i like . but i ca n't play it well .
i know . it 's boring . i 've always wanted to see the neighbors .
oh come on as long as it looks like we are on the way .
why do n't you have any bus ?
i 'm finished .
how much will that cost ?
you dance beautifully too .
yes . i hope you can make it .
but i still love it .
how long do you think it 's in the family ?
yes but i do n't think much of it .
you mean you can say that again ? you want to have a try .
that 's right .
well i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you . i like the way .
not much . you are a good friend and i know how to do the best of your own business .
but i just ca n't find things . you can also learn some day to keep fit .
i will . bye !
have you made any honors or awards at your university ?
what do you think about it ?
no . the fish is out of this world .
it 's ok .
a cup of coffee please .
i can do that .
that 's fine . let 's go .
here you are . sir the chocolate cake is ready .
i am sorry too . i know we 've been talking about this beach trip for a while . i should have told bob i was busy this weekend .
what did you have in mind ?
thanks for understanding .
well that 's what being friends is about is n't it ?
hey what if the three of us go to the beach together ? besides you and bob have n't seen each other for a while . i do n't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers .
nah i would n't worry about that . but i do n't want to be the third wheel . you two should have some quiet time to yourselves .
i know bob wo n't mind . you can bring a date like that guy from the bar you keep talking about .
maybe . . . i 'll think about it .
well last night i had a big argument with ann .
terrible . it must be something serious . you two are such close friends .
now that i look back at it it it it it was n't that big a deal . i should n't have lost my temper .
really ? what happened ?
well it was in the balkans during the war . he was only held for three days and then they simply released him . it was a case of mistaken identity and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . it was lucky they did n't kill him .
really ? that 's great news . what does your sister do for her ?
i know but i was so upset . i mean come on ! does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ?
you know she probably feels just as bad .
well i think i was being a little selfish myself . i know they do n't get to see each other very often .
well in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding . you should n't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . after all you can go to the beach anytime you want .
yeah i 'll call later to patch things up .
that 's very kind of you to say so . let 's try some <unk> wines .
great . sweet wines are my favorite . they always make a great finish to a decisions meal .
do you prefer brandy or ports .
port please .
excellent choice . i love its smooth flavor .
the port is quite exquisite . it must have spent years aging in barrels . am i right ?
yes . you always have a good nose for wines .
next time we are about to dinner we should try some canadian ice wine .
oh what 's that ?
well you know i have some students studying for their master 's degree . one of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
why not ? it sounds great .
ok here 's to your health .
thanks . cheers .
cheers .
i 'm very sorry i ca n't . i have to go to the gym .
i 'd like to go to the movies .
i 'm sorry but i do n't think that would be booked . could you repeat that please ?
yes .
yes . i have a few questions about that . it s about the job i m sure he will be available next monday .
i think you should make it . it is easier for you to get people to know .
i said it 's a lovely day . why do n't we go for a walk ?
really ? what did he do ? did he know that ?
yes it 's exciting .
what does he do ?
he was by handsome and rich .
i think you are absolutely right . actually my father proposed to my mother after the first two weeks .
he could n't have the heart to kill you . it 's not a secret .
so what did you do ?
right . and what about your friends ?
what s wrong ? that was a great goal .
no i haven t got to tell you about that .
looks like you re going to lose out on this game then .
i can t believe it ! i thought the cougars were going to win for sure .
what were the odds ?
almost .
too bad .
what is it ? what happened ?
i think someone is stalking me .
no it ca n't be . really ? who ?
i do n't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking but staring . he just kept staring at me . he did n't stop .
what did you do ?
i guess i was stunned for a moment then i quickly ran away to get help .
did he leave when you left ?
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .
what did you do ?
that 's about five blocks . and around corners too . so he was definitely following you .
yes he was . i 'm not imagining it . finally just when i got home i turned around and looked at him . he was just standing there . he just stood there . it was so obvious . what should i do ? i 'm so scared . can i call the police ?
actually i do n't think you can call the police . not yet at least . he has n't done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it . but if anything happens again then maybe you should call .
why ca n't i call the police now ? he was definitely following me !
of course you can call the police if you want . that 's not what i mean . i 'm just saying that they probably wo n't do anything .
i suppose . what can they do ? i do n't even know who he is .
yes that 's a great addition to my abilities .
alright . and i wo n't go to that cafe for awhile .
more or less . there 's just one thing bothering me .
oh ? what 's that ?
well you know i have some students studying for their master 's degree . one of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
what gift ?
it 's brown .
you refused the gift ? that 's terrible .
i know but i really ca n't accept such an expensive gift . i explained to him why but he seemed really upset about it . i think he might have taken it the wrong way .
perhaps . he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
that 's what i am worried about . i do understand the respect of the gift and it is a little more important than the gift .
no i 'm not . i 've got a cold .
can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 1000 ?
i would rather go to see a doctor .
i told you to clean it up .
it feels all right .
so you think we should take a look at the problem .
well now we have to walk now .
be careful ! the traffic is <unk> . you do n't have to wait to use a computer and let me do it .
well they were just looking for me . i didn t know you were looking for a long time .
so if we hold a moment i 'll take the tickets .
could you please go to a health party and have more rest ?
you have to study english during the class . you should try to get a job .
i was robbed .
how many rooms does it have ?
yes it is . think about it . if nobody paid any attention to anything then what 's it all for anyway ?
it 's just the problem with your ticket . is that right ?
i 'd like to have a hamburger .
here you are .
you have so many questions .
oh no . we just have to wait . i 'm not going to tell you .
i already voted .
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
what are you talking about ? we had n't done that for a long time .
it was n't too bad . we had a great time .
i really was n't feeling well so i guess .
we are n't training any good quality .
what 's the weather like in today ?
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . i 'll show you the receipt .
how long will it take to get there ?
it was a long time ago .
well the sea is calm and peaceful .
then i came back here . i worked for about three years to get some experience .
great . i guess we can take a walk around the river .
yes . i am glad you say so .
yes .
yes i 'm going to travel to london .
i do n't know what to say . do you have any plans for the first time ?
well . i would like to get a hamburger and a cup of coffee .
i see . . .
i am used to being on my own .
that 's right . but i could put you on a waiting list .
how much do you want to spend ?
my wife .
and what s your <unk> ?
oh it 's almost midnight ! it 's almost noon .
never mind . when can i get a message ?
i 'm with <unk> public relations . i 'd like to set up an appointment to come by and talk with you about our services .
you 've been .
oh i 'm sorry .
you do n't think he 's that excuse for you .
yeah . i know .
yes .
oh no ! when did your company start ?
well i would say that i m just drifting here in the pool .
but you two used to do everything together . i wouldn t be able to fit you for a long time .
because i am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !
have you thought about graduate school ?
yes i have . i graduated from the university of ottawa .
oh i 'm sorry .
you got me .
now listen ben . look i think it s a very good thing that a young man after he s done some very good work should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself and lie around and so on . but after a few weeks i believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his
i m afraid we can t .
not really . i sometimes just sit down and read a book .
i really wanted to tell you .
what kind of food do you want to eat ?
pretty good sam . only the awful weather you know .
that s right . i ve never really liked it since i got here .
i hope you ll make it .

it 's thursday i think .
what did he say ?
your honor the police officer pulled me over for speeding .
i do n't think so . maybe he 's to help him .
i 'm making a shopping budget . what 's the problem ?
i like board games .
here we are .
yes almost half of the years .
it 's about saturday and there 's a quiz show .
i 've never heard of that before . would you like to meet me at the club ?
i know . it 's a concert hall and the acoustics are great .
sure . it 's one of the biggest classical music events . have you ever been to the live show ?
yes i went to the new year s concert in .
we could see that . do you want to go to the concert tonight ?
you 're right . i love it very much . the food is excellent .
how is that ?
oh speaking of the conductor he is indeed a genius . he did a perfect job . his name is menuhin a descendent of russian american immigrants .
well he certainly did !
i could n't either . i 'm not a very fan of it .
but i did n't know that he would call me home .
yes i am . what 's wrong ?
yes .
well as we say the rest is history . . .
that s terrible . they must have been their first anyway .
sure . the local product is divided into two parts .
there is a big lake in the park . it is very beautiful .
yes . the scenery there is so breathtaking
ok i do n't want to go with you .
our office address is next to two of our store programs .
i never thought about that . maybe i should just focus on my own .
it s just funny .
can you put it on the swimming pool ?
what do you want to do ?
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
no . i think that 's the best thing for you .
sure hope to hear from you as soon as possible .

no i 'm afraid it will be too late .
well i just saw the british version and last night . was it flashing ?
do you think you have a good relaxation ?
yes but i saw the movie and came back at home in about thirty minutes .
mmm how much is it ?
i am awfully sorry . i have no idea of that .
great . i 'll be there in a minute .
i think so too . and you 're lucky to be so soft and cheerful . it 's hard to narrow the rule down the eve of your body to narrow the midfield .
what 's he doing ?
it 's very nice .
he 's not doing well . he 's a hard worker .
put it on my visa .
not very well . he speaks english and he can say a few english words .
i will need to see the stamp and interest rates .
that was my pleasure . actually i have a meeting right now .
you got it . did you mail the letter ?
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
i 'm a little worried about my host family . you know in the agreement i have to do some cooking for them .
really ? do you have any other questions about the job ?
it bears a great many of advantages but also some weak points .
is it ? i 've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
for instance the mobile phone seriously the attention of people from work and study .
so you just continue to be interested in that ?
actually it 's not the fault of the mobile phone . but people should have a proper attitude towards it . mobile phone is a tool serving people not the fetters restricting them .
well take it easy ! do n't let it get on time .
i sure do . i have a problem finding a job .
well good for you ! you know you did n't get the right amount . when did you leave the company ?
i could take some time off . i mean how far away is the meeting ?
what a pity ! i have to see you tomorrow afternoon .
i know . but i did n't realize it was so easy .
it 's no problem at all .
yeah . water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues .
but what are the sources of water pollution ?
they could generally be divided into two categories direct and indirect contaminant sources .
can you give me some special programs ?
not quite .
but what about the indirect ones ?
indirect sources include that enter the water supply from or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater .
so you think that
sure . it 's an issue asking for everyone 's participation .
okay let 's call it a day .
i know but that 's the best way to me .
just get online and find a good answer to the employer .
i was just robbed !
well i hope you will become more professional .
well it was in the balkans during the war . he was only held for three days and then they simply released him . it was a case of mistaken identity and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . it was lucky they did n't kill him .
that 's interesting .
senior account rep .
do you think it s a good idea to get the teacher ?
for me i have a master 's degree and i think a good idea for them .
so you will become a part of it .
how can you live ?
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
so many customers have to pay the staff decent ?
that 's true . you do n't know the same thing in my country do you ?
i like fishing but i have to stay in bed for a long time .
i am not sure i would like to do it .
great . i 'll come back tomorrow and we can then discuss it more specifically .
let s meet in front of the train station .
when did you say ?
i will go to your office at 9
see you .
yes but it 's not the right time . i am a little worried about my wife . i would like to sell one for my son .
i see . it 's hard to believe that it 's true . but what can we do ?
oh yeah ? what s wrong ?
goodness we 're not rich and famous !
i 'll have to write you a ticket and <unk> your vehicle .
oh no . i have to go to the conference center . i just need to go to the conference .
good afternoon ! sit down please . how are you ?
i 'm fine thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it 's hard to keep track of everything around here .
it 's a pleasure to meet you .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
yes it is .
i see . how do you like the library ?
can i take a message ?
a korean film called friends starring sang .
how did it happen ?
how did you like the movie ?
i thought it was pretty good .
really ? i ca n't say i agree .
is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ?
i see .
i guess it could happen .
is this a promise ?
thank you very much . i 'm looking forward to seeing the new carpet .
can you make it tomorrow ?
well i am used to it . now i have no idea how to face the music .
no wonder you are so oldfashioned .
i really need to go to the movies .
try this one on please .
of course not .
what are you doing ?
i could easily give you some time tomorrow night .
actually i m not available at the moment .
how about tuesday ?
hello . may i speak to mark please ?
no that 's 4479626 .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
for what time ?
well do you have any other seats ?
of course .
that 's ok .
and do you want to have them made of chocolate ?
my name is paul <unk> .
sure . it s my pleasure . what can i do for you ?
well i think this one is a little too small . would you please bring me a bigger one ?
good . anything else ?
have you ever thought of another company ?
i know . but i am going to apply for a longterm loan .
what 's the weather like in winter ?
i like winter but sometimes it gets too cold .
i ca n't stand the loud noise in the city .
seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? that 's a good idea . let 's go !
hey darling i think i might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . i was so relaxed . it felt as if i were in another world .
they are beautiful . i like them .
i 've got it . i like the sound of stepping on the snow very much .
yes . very wonderful .
do you smell the sweet scent ?
how big was it ?
he sure is . he loves the gift .
okay . . .
sure . are you sure you 're here ?
no but i 'm afraid that i did n't get it .
i agree . but in my opinion the least you have been to the airport for 7 years . what about your family ?
well i got it from the other times .
well in that case you put him up or for a good night .
we went to the park in the city .
why do you want to leave the insurance company ?
that s a good idea . we can go to a park and enjoy the scenery in the afternoon .
is that a return journey or a return ?
it 's my pleasure !
neither . the game ended in two all .
but i still think ac milan's defence seems better organized .
but the brazilian is tougher .
i bet he is . did you lose his job ?
he is in his late thirties .
i like to . but it is too cold for some people like christmas .
i guess that 's the way to be true .
yes you 're right . i like it . but it has a great feeling .
how many rooms do you have ?
i think so . i think the biggest problem at first . a lot of people in australia are so friendly to some people .
very good idea . sometimes such pictures can show the house 's richness .
so what can i do ?
i think it s a great idea . but i don t like it because i like it .
is the new product different ?
sports .
what kind of stamps do you like ?
you can find almost anything .
well i like playing the piano .
do you have any hobbies besides playing chess ?
yes it 's a very difficult game .
i 'll see you at your house at eight ?
that 'd be nice . what did you have in mind ?
not much . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .
oh really ? where did you get the ticket ?
well i <unk> n't think so at first . but as we started talking i found him extremely funny and witty . i could n't stop laughing at his jokes ! we have so much in common . we like the same teams music and most amazingly we both love chinese food ! i have the feeling that we are going to be great friends .
it seems you two are a good match . what qualities do you look for in a friend ?
there 's nothing definite i think . i do n't have a list or anything but when i first meet somebody i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have a radar helping me spot new friends .
well that 's something i 've never heard of . but if you ask me what i value most in a friend i would have to say honesty .
i agree . you ca n't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .
yeah i know . a friend in need is a friend indeed . i do n't need fairweather friends either .
i like taking photos .
there 's an interesting interview with a top director about what you have in china .
i like baseball the best .
how about samba ?
there are several chess and an inch of a few people in the book .
do you know who you like to play ?
yes i do . i have to save money in the bank account but i only have to write it back to another time .
i like to play the piano you know .
i think the slight pay decrease might be worth it . the benefits are much better .
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .
oh it 's love at first sight . when will you see each other again ?
he did n't say but he said he would call me .
maybe he is busy with his work . just wait and try not to think about it too much !
oh steve . stop it ! i am a bit nervous ! what if he does n't call ?
come on mary you 're a total catch . i bet he will call you . do n't worry .
thank you steve . you 're always so encouraging .
you 're welcome . now smile . . .
thank you . oh it s very nice of you to say so .
that 's good . can i have your drink ?
where ?
well you are right . the girl is so attractive .
i 've heard that when this happens it 's important to save energy .
oh i like her butting in where i did n't know her .
come on . this is why they say this .
i think you can say that again .
well i had fun with them .
when you go out with john who is in high school .
in college . this is my first time to be in a college center of the country .
did you already know your favorite band ?
i do n't like the work . i 'm not honestly about quitting my job .
i 'm going to the hospital .
yeah . i love it .

why is that ?
yes you 're right . we have a very quiet neighbourhood .

i really appreciate it . thank you .
we took a while to find out some window and give me a break .
yes . i have you got the latest email .
i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
i 'm afraid it 's a bit too cold for your size . would you like to have a look at this one ?
do n't be so shy ! i just bought a new outfit the party .
i do n't think so . they 've very good news either .
i thought he only liked to do that .
ok sir . but do n't forget to take your clothes off .
ok keep your chin up .

i was just kidding .
congratulations ! how old are you ?
let me show you .
it was a great game .
that 's terrible . you should take it .
i need to see your id and 27 .
are there many thanks ?
all right . i promise you that you 'll do well after we get started .
oh dad how can i do that ? i mean what will it be ?
oh no . what ?
well apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . typical is n't it ?
got it . then ? is he coming back from america ?
well as we say the rest is history . . .
okay then . i 'll get my things done .
no not yet . but he 's still here .
i do wish i could lose weight
well i guess that we have to work overtime tonight .
what 's the problem ?
but he s not very tall and slim .
why did you say that ?
because i feel tired all the time even when i wake up in the morning . i find it very difficult to do any work . i have no appetite .
yes i had a bad cold .
that 's too bad . i 'm sorry .
does the house have a lot of noise ?
yes jane was quite upset about it . the manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert but still . .
did the cops show up in time ?
well as we say the rest is history . . .
then he is really lucky .
i want to go to the live because i do n't know how to use the stairs .
hey ! get it back to you .
that 's correct .
i agree . i 'm really into it .
i m doing well .
what are you going to do ?
yes i 've just married .
i have some friends who might be able to help you find a job .
it 's true . she said we 're very lucky .
that 's true .
um let 's see . . . how do you like them ?
what a good idea !
no . what 's the matter ?
what did you do ?
well it 's too slow for me .
do n't be silly . i 've got enough money to go !
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for her for her for a full hour in the cold wind .
is there some way you can get off work .
yes jane was quite upset about it . the manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert but still . .
i suppose you 're right . what can i do ? i do n't know .
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
that 's great . thanks .
i 'm going to <unk> the lawn .
alright tell me what 's your sister doing .
i can only hold the table .
what did you say to him ?
do you know if she 's read this one ?
that 's good . i 've got a car from the city .

yes i can hardly bear it ! i want to see your favorite sport .

here is your boarding pass .
that 's nice . but have you got some fishing there ?
which one interests you sir ?
i see . what s the problem ?
it 's a bit difficult to walk another way .
i need you to hurry up .
it s all right . where are you going ?
you 're probably right . i think you 'd better go to the party and get some food .
no . . .
you bet . i will get my camera . that 's supposed to be my fault !
you re in america now my british friend . we just call it football .
oh right . so i can t quite follow what s going on . . . who s winning ?
the giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked but the have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone .
wow ! what a hit !
yeah he tackled him so hard his helmet came off .
is he ok ?
it looks like it he s getting up .
i guess he hit him too hard the just called a penalty on the home team .
the giants ?
yeah .
do you know chinese better now ?
what happened ? why did everyone get so quiet ?
the s just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . we re losing again .
yeah i just got them . i started playing ice hockey in a community league . so i finally got myself new skates .
what position do you play ?
i m a defender . it s a lot of fun . you don t have to be able to skate as fast on defense .
yeah you re a pretty big guy . i play goalie myself .
oh yeah ? which team ?
the rockets .
really ? i think we play you guys next week . well i have to go to practice . see you later .
sure . i have to pick up my parents and i 'll be back tomorrow .
we are going to climb a cliff on the colorado river .
how hard is the climb ?
it is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .
what did you do last week ?
we rappelled down the side of a 300 foot cliff . it 's very exciting .
wow ! that sounds like a lot of fun . i m sorry i missed it .
well you should come this weekend . i think you could do the climb .
yeah i will . see you then !
o . k . see you .
i 'm just watching some television .
i 'm so bored . i do n't know what i 'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning .
me too . do you think we are boring people ?
i do n't think we are boring . it 's just that we do n't have any hobbies .
that 's right . what do you think we should do as a hobby ?
i think i should go to the movies i like teaching young children and i can also play english quite well .
i like to play the piano for fun .
really ? how long have you been playing piano ?
you can read and write about the scholarship .
and do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
awesome we went to australia and new zealand .
that must have been wonderful . do anything interesting ?
well we went bungee jumping when we were in australia .
wow ! isn t that dangerous ?
a little but the rush was worth it .
tell me about it .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
500 feet ! i would never be able to do that .
yeah it was scary but exhilarating .
you have got a great idea .
yes he is . he loves the girl very much .
i have a question .
you 're right . it 's a good thing for a young people like that .
it s not just one meter .
you have seen the red double rooms in the world did you find it ?
i guess i 've got the wrong information . i mean i suspect that they think the same about us .
so i wish to stay with the family ?
yes there 's so many interesting project to choose .
yes but do n't you think that 's a good idea ?
wow you really do n't have to send that kind of email ?
that 's no way !
i do n't know . there are so many famous national history ones .
yes it is .
do you have to think about that ?
most of them in this store are from mexico .
oh i think they sell both at the cafeteria .
yeah they are .
i want to make sure my vote is in .
so the guest is to be there ?
will mary and her husband be ready to leave for their honeymoon ?
i see .
what a lucky party !
i do n't know . but do n't worry about that before the bride comes to us .
got it . mary and her husband must be very happy about that .
oh . . . so what do you do there ?
we ll send our staff to make sure that we don t have to spend the time on a trip . how about you ?
does it have to be a lot of fun ?
i see .
wow ! how highclass . . . a new pair for each day . .
that sounds a lot of work . i wish we could get together to work on that day .
where is the holiday inn that is ?
less than a day . we have a isn t really scared of ten minutes .
well we accept your suggestion suggestion .
another tough thing is to do . people easily become blind worshippers of a westernized life .
so how many months do you have ?
we 'll be there in time .
i 'm afraid there is n't .
really ? do you have any for tomorrow ?
about 7 o 'clock .
what 's the earliest flight available ?
in what ways ?
wow that is quite convenient . do you have any direct flights ?
yes of course . we can put you in a few minutes .
and it 's calm . i like the peace .
i think it 's better for some things like sending and receiving money but if the government is a person they ca n't afford to live without their living environment .
well . the club is coming . i 'll have to take you there .
i want two seats in the main rows .
when ?
that 's too bad .
no . but not for me today . i 'll go over the weekend and buy some souvenirs .
yep ! you got a list of all the clubs that are in need to pay for money .
it is hard to say . if only the government is to provide stress for stress and transportation to secure their customers is much better than in china .
does that make any difference ?
i see . the stir fry ? that 's pretty much safer than the others . . .
i 'll take you later .
yes . we have some nice sugar .
how many people are you together ?
all right . how about we get a bite to eat in the morning ?
i 'll give you a call tonight and we can discuss it together .
you have a very good taste sir .
do you know how to turn it off ?
usually if you can email them back on the website or hand address the book .
ok then many other things are selling work .
i know . people who do n't have any choice but lately they are definitely as affectionate as dogs or cats .
yes my sister loves it so far .
you can always spot the newbies . i can give you a few pointers if you want . were you trying to use this machine here ?
an interesting song ?
i don t know . well i have n't got a long time . i hope you have the good time .
yeah . it 's just a simple thing .
let 's go to see the places .
why not ? the heat is climbing up the heavy metal body .
i will be a little more excited about it .
well you should be so negative .
let me see . do you know how to plant the pandas ?
in america most children start primary school at the age of five .
did they accept the check ?
that 's right .
perfect ! this is a perfect time for us to start on the market . i think this is a fantastic time for you !
that 's a good idea ! where does your kids get to ?
almost 70 madam .
i m afraid you re being too particular about your food .
thank you .
just like for me ?
yes that 's right .
it 's a good thing i really need to go with you .
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
i do n't understand why they have such an important project .
i think that 's a good idea . all i know is that the kids will break down the street to help him .
they 're right .
they 're right to eat . i want some meat .
it 's no use complaining . if the avalanche happened in the world we would n't put up with it .
well all right . this pair looks really good .
thank you .
the park is so beautiful . it 's a good thing i have taken the camera .

okay it sounds good .
hooray ! i can play football with daddy . mom and sister can play badminton .

so there is n't air in the glass boxes ?
no there is n't . they are all vacuumed .
would you mind waiting ?
yeah they all come from a very ancient time .

very seldom because tea has which may be harmful to one 's health .
i 've heard that when this happens it 's important to save energy .
well have you ever heard people say french and good tea ?
i know . i prefer this kind of tea .
i m just calling to let you know that we had decided to set the alarm clock .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
hold on a moment please .
i know you have a tight schedule so i wo n't take up more of your time . have a good evening .
you ca n't be serious . you ca n't have a problem .
that 's right .

please do n't fill in this form .

well i came to know a girl 3 weeks ago and we have so much in common .
just asking ? but why is your face burning like mad ? ahhuh someone has a crush on jenny does n't he ?
he 's the one . . . i 'm a big fan of him .
come on ted do n't be such a chicken . if you like her you ve got to tell her . maybe she likes you .
i know . i 'll find her and i get over her later .
but that 's better than keeping everything to yourself . you 've got to let her know . come on ! you 've got to take a chance ! even though you are rejected it 's not the end of the world ! there 's nothing to lose is there ?
you like it . hey have you forgotten i should mention this for a while ?
bottom 's up and you 're right . this meal is incredible . i wish i had known this restaurant before . thanks for bringing me here . i know i 'll be back soon .
i 'm so happy that you could have your birthday present for your birthday .
yes . the sun are great . i like the floor .
i ca n't believe it .
i like one . and i like the black one .
most women like you do n't know the girls do that .
i bought a lot of younger girl .
thanks for that .

well i am thinking about getting some dessert .
i 'm going to get to the meeting .
sorry . the journey is too cold and we have to finish our homework .

oh the day after tomorrow is christmas .
i 'm afraid that 's too much for us .
oh good . that ll be the best we can do .
yes she 's beautiful .
in this restaurant .
i was born yesterday . i was born in <unk> with a dessert .
and when is your birthday ?
do you have a different taste ?
really ? how did he do that ?
i do n't know . . . well she 's probably married .
so you simply want to show the <unk> by yourself ?
are you sure you 'd like it ?
you should know that she is a neat freak .
i just think you re right .
no . you look so beautiful .
what color do you want ?
she 's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair .
i think so . maybe i could just work out a fitness plan and start to do everything myself .
you 're right . i think it 's just a good idea to keep track of all the time .
you have a real taste !
yes .
i am . what 's up ?
i was just robbed !
but i do n't have to be interested in going to the movies .
yes . i 'll be back in ten minutes .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
well . . . we have to go to the movies .
i 'll pick you up at the gate of your company .
we do n't have to wait for the next bus .
i will pick you up at your hotel at eight o 'clock .
ok .
hi . i ve just got a wonderful time .
did you have to pay the fee ?
i 'm going to miss you too . goodbye .
i 'm sorry for that .
yes . i hope to hear from you as soon as possible .
we appreciate your help .
excuse me miss . can i use the cellular phone during this time ?
goodbye !
sure . have you got anywhere in mind ?
i 'm starving so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .
that italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . do you want to go there ?
i 'm not really in the mood for italian actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy .
if you want spicy food then i 'd recommend going to a thai indian or chinese restaurant . how about that chinese buffet on <unk> road ?
i really like that restaurant you get a lot for your money there . but they 've westernized their food so it 's not actually that spicy .
you 're right . most of their dishes have sweet sauces . we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us .
the taj ? they 're a bit expensive but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
the taj it is then .
shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
they 'll still charge us a corkage fee .
that 's right . it 'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .
do n't worry about money . i 'll treat you tonight .
are you sure ? we could go dutch .
no i 'll pay . it 's my turn anyway . you paid last time .
i wo n't argue with that ! let 's go !
we have to get everyone to get ready .
i 'll tell you what i 've got to go .
i have to teach you how to drive .
do n't worry . i 'm going to bed .
they 're cute .
thanks . it 's beautiful . you shouldn t have !
thank you lisa . it s a long time to pick up my wife .
i ve been doing a lot of work so i started feeling sick .
i bet you will enjoy the food .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
it 's a pleasure .
i just started working out at a restaurant .
i didn t say that . why do you want to come out and tell me what you want to do ?
i 'm sorry it took so long .
i have a great time . i have a friend who give you my dog or my dog .
it 's only seven minutes to go to sleep now .
i was sick that day and could n't make it .
but he is more important than you now .
he is in his late thirties .

that 's great . congratulations .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
i think you 'll find out if she is available .
dark blue .
he prefers suits to jackets .
judge from his look he 's a very serious person .
as a matter of fact he is .
do n't believe him . he 's a liar .
we cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
they have moved to chicago .
wow you are leaving on november 11th .
because i am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !
i have more than one hundred yuan .
that 's correct . it was a really great deal .
i 'm not sure but i think it 's our biggest pan .
oh that 's great ! how much is the rib fee ?
that 's true .
oh i see .
no problem .
i want to go back to my college on sunday .
well how many days of going there do you have ?
i have a big date tonight .
what about the party ?
i never know what to do . i just need to prepare the supper .
it 's about 3 kilometers .
where are you going to stay ?
how much will we spend on that corner ?
and i 'm going to have a picnic with my friends .
i went there five years ago . you were in college now but i was n't sure i could get a good one .
star war .
i know but it 's too cold for me to find a parking game .
good afternoon ! sit down please . how are you ?
i 'm very well thank you . how are you ?
very well too thank you very much . isn t it a lovely day ?
yes it 's beautiful but it 's also very hot .
yes .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
it 's pretty cold and it 's often windy . it snowed a lot in chicago .
where do you live ?
i live in the haitian district .
in london . where do you live ?
i feel very tired . i 've got a bad cold .
i 'm fine . what 's up ?
how was your flight ?
good to see you too !
spring .
how about summer ?
because i am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !
i like spring too . we can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air .
i was robbed .
i 've heard that when this happens it 's important to save energy .
ok .
never mind .
i wanted to .
we 'd better go out for a walk .
ok .
spring .
how about summer ?
i dislike it most .
do you think that 's the problem ?
because i am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !
but sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
i feel bad about how much the manager is wondering if you would like to pay for it .
i really hate this weather .
poor fellow ! what 's the date today buddy ?
it 's . . . oh it 's the 1st april april fool 's day .
you forgot all of about it did n't you ?
on 20th may 1963 .
do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ?
27th day of the fourth month .
by the way could you tell me when the film will begin ?
it will begin at five thirty .
is your watch right ?
i have to go now . would you mind taking a taxi ?
i do n't want to miss it today .
it was n't too bad . we had a great time .
oh yes i loved it . was n't the scene with the judge great ?
we are n't training any good quality .
do you have any idea of any single rooms ?
yes i did .
i see . how long does it take to get there ?
when i entered the room i forgot to close the door . later i couldn t help smoking you know i am a heavysmoker . what s more i forgot to polish my shoes . there is some dirt on it .
great . i guess we can go now . it 's just nice to have a picnic with my friends .
yes . i am glad you say so .
me too . recently i 've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them .
how do you know ?
i 'm afraid not . to me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
yes that s right . are you going to be here for your vacation ?
i like your books . they re really beautiful .
yes . there are so many attractions and they all have on the top . i 've never seen one of the programs in the world .
when did you start worrying about your weight ?
of course i will .
give me the roses .
well it is said that the presents they got value less than 200 yuan and it is no problem at all .
how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look ? i remember there is one in the gym .
that 's a good idea . i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
me too . what did you have in mind ?
i have n't decided yet but i think the olympic mascots are a must .
i agree . they are very lovely especially huan .
but i think they 're very romantic .
the five dolls are sold together as a set and they 're priced according to the size . the bigger they are the more expensive .
oh i see . if i buy more than a set can i get any discount ?
i do n't think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now .
any other ideas ?
there are lots of things such as postcards key chains posters and various arts and crafts .
it all sounds great . we can go there after the match . i ca n't wait to see what they have .
it s a lot harder than i imagined . there are many things that you have to to arrange . i booked a time and date with the funeral home but i still have a lot of things to do .
by the way do you like the weather here ?
oh yes . it s a very nice day .
of course . i 'm from taiwan .
i am not sure . it would be quite far too expensive for us to take the public transport .
but how can you do that ?
we are waiting for their bags .
i like horror movies .
then why are you celebrating them ?
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
i bought you a new one last year . it 's too early to buy some clothes .
i see . i like horror movies because i like to be scared .
no i have n't .
oh really ? what s it like ?
not really . . . i like the color and the style that are good too .
well what do you think is the most important thing for you to do ?
no i don t .
oh yes . i have . it 's very interesting .
i 'm sorry . you must be my favorite .
it was seven feet tall .
yes i do . i like the novels a lot .
what about the price ?
sounds like a bit of the stores . oh look at the bottom . there is a nice view from the zoo .
i told you that i hadn t got a raise for three years .
oh that 's terrible . is it your right arm or your left arm ?
i feel as if i am going to have a family vacation .
ok . don t worry about it . i ll treat you back .
yeah . it was a sign of rain .
you do n't think that way . at least you did n't buy anything .
would you like to withdraw any money ?
you re welcome . if you ask me any help .
yes . but bob does .
how do you like your holiday ?
of course ! i was just treated with you .
oh my . we had to cut back on the freeway .
i see . you ve been sitting for three hours with your attention highly concentrated .
i m sorry to hear that . i ll get another prescription for you .
why don t you sit down for a little bit ?
that s true . but i have to go jogging now . i really need some time .
joe ? i do n't know what you mean .
i remember you are in love .
oh i took a shine to him when we met for the first time . but it comes and goes .
it 's greek to me .
so the reform can not be carried out well .
the government is making efforts to change situation .
yes .
he is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
what ? it s only 9 p . m . now . why today he went to bed so early ?
he ran four miles and came back dead beat .
he s unbelievable ! what if he showed up ?
i 'm tired of your opinions . who do you think you are !
oh my god .
why not ?
i 'm sorry .
i knew this would happen some day . . .
you are so thoughtful .
i feel the same way .
it must be dreadful to grow old .
it sure is . he has no one to turn to very miserable indeed .
have n't you heard that he is in prison ?
what ? beg your pardon .
john is in prison now . he was copped outstealing .
i just can n't believe my ears !
i ca n't deny that . she is so beautiful that i fell in love with her at the first sight . i wish i knew more about her .
but i heard that she had a threeyearold girl .
i can not belive that . it must be cooked up by someone .
of course i wo n't chill out . opportunity knocks only once .
you should strike while the iron is hot .
you 're right . i will have a talk to her about that .
when is it ?
yeah . but his relation with sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife .
he deserved it .
sorry i can t .
why not ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
i do n't feel like going to the theatre .
yes it 's a great job .

yes of course . this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
i m glad you re enjoying it .
thank you for the invitation .

yes it does . we call it a day .
thanks goodbye .

ok see you then .
see you tonight then .
yes . thank you for inviting me .
it s good . but to tell you the truth i don t wear perfume .
i m sorry . i didn t know that .
i ll just have to wait for ucla .

i m working . i often work late on thursdays . i am busy this week .
where do you spend your holiday ?
tomorrow ? no i 'm afraid i would n't be able to . i 'm going out of the town on business .
well i guess you ll have to be more careful .
sorry i never go out on saturday evening . i always watch football on saturday evening .

next tuesday ? just a moment ! it will be the 21st of may . oh dear . arm . . i promised my aunt i would be at her birthday party .

great . bye .
bye .
i 'm very glad to hear that . thank you for your help .
thank you .
i like the steak .
i m glad to hear that .
yes it s just a little bit .
i went to yale university .
why did you decide to get so much money from the university ?
i have a b . a . in economics .
would you mind telling me how old you are ?
i 'm twentyseven .
how about sichuan food ?
yes i have worked in a bank for the last five years .
do you mean you like to work for ibm ?
i got 500 a week .
thank you . good evening mr . dean .
would you tell us your name please ?
i 'm helen baker .
glad to meet you ms . baker .
glad to meet you too .
where are you from ms . baker ?
i 'm from new zealand .
what do you do for a living ?
i m a doctor .
thank you for coming ms . baker .
what s the problem ?
may i know what you do ?
yes . thank you .
sorry i do n't know . i am busy .
what about the cinema ?
how about tomorrow night ?
thank you . can i cancel my reservation ?
what are you hiding behind your back ? let s just say that again !
i 'd love to go out with you but i 'm sorry i 'm busy tonight but i 'd like a rain check .
i m sorry . i can t make tuesday or thursday .
yes it is . and i d like to go tomorrow morning .
all right . i ve got your teeth cleaned . it s the rush hour .
no i have n't but i 've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper .
what kind of job are you looking for ?
i 'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the it field .
you have n't had any experience in either of those fields .
i know . but i 'd like to try . look here are some advertisements that i 've cut out .
i was turned down again . it s frustrating . i guess you ve got to teach me some skills .
me ? i m even less experienced than you are .
at least you know what american women generally like in a man .
believe it or not i guess american women like a man in good shape which chinese women may not care about so much . that s my honest opinion . i know you have been trying very hard .
american men are naturally taller than chinese men . so even if i exercise there aren t many chances .
no that s not true . i ve met two american women who were married to chinese . but those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is chan ? he s small and short . but i bet he can have any american woman he wants .
me too . but you see i guess that s the way to keep fit .
why don t you try then ? even if it doesn t help you find an american girl you could still have a stronger and healthier body . you won t lose anything by doing that .
hi don t you work out ?
yeah i saw someone walking like you but i wasn t sure . we haven t seen each other for how long ? almost three months ? but you look quite different now .
have you noticed what has changed ?
oh you look quite slender and more <unk> . what have you been taking ? are you on a diet ?
yes . i m on a diet but i ve not taken anything . i just eat less and exercise more . and it really worked in the past three months . i ve lost twelve pounds .
wow ! that s great . i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals but it s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . also you know old habits are hard to break .
what kind of exercise do you think i do ? i just go to dance everyday after work . i m taking an amateur dance class . i dance two hours everyday .
dance ? you only go dancing ? that s not hard . i can do that .
sure . join my class next week .
great !
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
tell me about that .
what do you mean ?
then the you must be asked for your exam .
let 's see . have you been to a jazz club yet ?
are you serious ? i have to go to the class everyday class on saturday and sunday ?
how about going to a movie with me ?
maybe i 'll start with a strategy meeting at least two in the evenings .
this is only your mother 's fault . i was thinking of trying a new one .
me too . but i 've never tried taking a chance to learn english when i was at university .
i 'm not sure .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
like what ? i think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction .
but i think that will take soon !
yes i 'm fine . i just came in a bit of a hurry .
i know you 've done a lot but you need to take good notes .
i know . i 'm a little worried about my host family .
i do n't think so . i 've been having a cold for a week . my boss is n't really just to study . i think it 's necessary for me to stay in the mountains .
well i 'll take care of everything . and i get back to you early .
well why do n't you tell me a little more about your family ?
i 'll try to keep a good one another .
no the meeting will be friendly and energetic .
you said it ! that 's really true !
i was just watching tv .
yes .
i won t be able to see them on the internet . will you come out with me ?
well you are over at the moment !
it was a very big game . it was the best local coffee shop .
i love you too !
i 've never seen a better game .
ok .
that 's right .
well . i 'll have a try .
i did n't know that before .
yeah i got it . but you always act like this . i am a good friend to work .
you know it 's hard to say . i 've decided to make sure that you eat the right thing .
which is your favorite in this ten ?
i like scary movies .
you know i often overhear our neighbor the young couple fighting about how to raise their kid and i really do n't want kids to spoil our happiness .
i m glad to hear that . . . it will be great to see you again . i can t believe you were interested in this job .
i 'm afraid that i 'm very ill .
it s not that bad . it s just that it s a skill . i know it s not a good thing .
i will call you later .
it will cost you around five hundred to one thousand dollars for a home inspection .
no problem . may i have your name please ?
you should know that already .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
would you like to have dinner with me ?
thank you .
okay . i ll take it .
i see . thank you .
that was a bit nervous . it was a bit loud .
my new job is in a great place . i ve just wanted to tell you that i have a special email to tell you that i have been looking forward to this week .
yes i was .
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
thank you . i will start looking at the internet at the online sites .
well . you may ask him whether he wants to give it a try .
yes of course . it 's really worth visiting .
it 's a traditional chinese specialty . our restaurant is famous for its food .
bob is retiring wow . . . that 's what 's the exchange rate for bob .
now your son is ready to show the <unk> . he s got a fine job and he s got a lot of fun from him .
i guess they 're right . it 's also hard to avoid being stolen .
well it 's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . so unfortunately you 'll lose this 50 rib . we 'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .
but they spend hours there . life is always some kind of new balance every year .
i m fine .
i have a clear idea .
that 's a good idea . i 'll give you a call .
i was robbed .
oh . so what do you do to deal with ?
yeah but you know i have to do it .
so what did you do yesterday ?
of course i do . i think i 'm a bit of a work that day as a manager .
you need to keep it at 100 .
well i just wanted to say well . . . you know i 've been in a host . it 's not just a little trouble .
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
and ms . white ?
thank you . it s very nice to see you too .
the view from the lake and rain .
oh dear ! well i don t think i ve ever get a divorce !
you can always bring me a hot pot schedule and then go back to the office .
great ! i m just joking t going to be like a minute !
oh i saw a lot of book on the computer while i was in a hurry . i forgot to tell you about your chinese poesy with me .
it 's really far from here .
yeah . i ll have to get one tomorrow .
it 's furnished .
and how much do you want to insure it ?
you can buy that type of italian houses . they are also available to the market .
i am not sure about the price .
yes it is . but there are two bedrooms a living room a kitchen and a big kitchen .
is the room still in a good location ?
it s a pity that a bit silly to cash my clothes so that i can t afford a while .
i promise you 'll have to pay for the home inspection .
have you thought about it ?
thank you .
it could be that simple . there are problems in the air .
yes . good for you .
i think in some way it is an act of god but in another way it just is caused by us .
i think i agree with you . but what should i do ?
well last week i invited her over to dinner . my husband and i had no problem with the food but if you listened to her then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . there 's just nothing can please her .
oh i see . fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things .
really ? that 's a in the wind .
oh yes .
yeah . they suit each other . a perfect match between a man and a girl .
it sounds nice .
oh you didn t have to . . .
you said it . you didn t go to the class to the gym ?
all right . i 'll start my work at the moment .
but the food 's so different from other food . i wish the same problem was what i 've heard .
well i do n't know .
yes of course .
it 's a small world is n't it ?
i 'm still hungry .
i 'd like to have lunch with me .
sound good ! please give me your cold cold choices .
i like beefsteak very much . have you tried chinese dishes ?
let me give you a hand . the author is . . .
i hear the beaches in america like sweet food . is that true ?
how much money did you have ?
that 's fate .
i feel sorry for her .
maybe this is god 's will .
we have two cleaning ladies . but both of them have received little education .
most cleaning ladies are illiterate . but some of them do a very nice job .
but i actually dislike another lady . she is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own .
someone has stolen my cell phone .
are you introverted or extroverted ?
your daughter is a wonderful student .
well we provide uptodate training on state of our own .
i 'd like to do that .
well we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . the trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the workout plan .
what else ?
since everyone is different your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . then you 'llbe taught all the necessary techniques to us
sounds pretty good . how much do you charge ?
well it depends on how many pieces of luggages you have .
perhaps one month . i 'll just have a try at first .
i guess that might work for me .
yes . i 'm fond of playing the chess and i 'm very keen on playing cards .
oh that s interesting and but what kind of things ?
several things for example various coins stamps stones and so on .
stones ? i know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?
believe it or not . i thought people in an advertisement company are becoming more popular .
well i can t just image it .
not so bad . what is your favorite animal ?
thank you mrs . smith . goodbye .
i 'm so sorry i 've seen you .
well . you look so pale .
actually it 's time for me to say . but you know the stuff . i do n't have a chance to worry about them .
can you help me ? i have n't heard you .
the traffic problem will soon be .
just let me get my coat and you 'll have to come back tonight .
here you are .
you are such a good father .
yes it is .
honey it 's just windy and raining outside .
the best part i guess . the finally a little boy is to be out of the country .
that s a bit funny . the weather is awful . i guess it 's pretty cold and it does n't seem like a bit cold today .
it s my acceptance letter to yale !
oh that 's good . she looks like a rose .
do n't worry . no big deal . just a common cold .
it 's really cold . it snowed all day and the school closed early .
now that 's why you listen to me .
it 's beautiful . enjoy it while it lasts . it 's supposed to get cold tomorrow .
yes . it 's been raining a lot these days .
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
let 's just hope it does n't get cold again .
ok i 'll show you how to use the computer .
oh my god you are very nice .
i do n't know . all my friends have had a great time .
yes i 'm a great student too . when did you become a teacher ?
they are all very well . i made a few friends of them .
do you think you could come along sometime ?
yes . but you 'd better get a student visa .
no it 's just a waste of cash .
why ? you said so . i m very sorry about that .
i know . but i do n't think so . studying all the time . i have a good job and a half is not an easy job .
i 've been doing a lot of work lately .
uh no problem .
i had a long time ago .
how much is the room rate ?
i want to study english literature .
thanks for coming to see us . did you need help with writing ?
oh you 're such a wimp ! you 're an eyelash curler .
really ? that 's great !
thanks for your help . and there 's a problem with the expense report .
of course . you can register by the chinese table .
oh i see . what 's the film about ?
they will make their friends .
of course . they have many kinds of programs .
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
it 's interesting and i want to buy one home .
yes it has . my friend says she has a wonderful evening in paris .
yeah . it 's why we have lots of fun .
well i guess you are interested in history .
i 'm sure you are right . i just need to take a look at the missing one .
it 's a beautiful city . this is n't it ?
you re right . but i just do n't have to worry about it .
thank you .
no i do n't . i just thought it was that i do n't have a chance to go to college .
great . i will go to the edd office to help me with my job search .
that 's not enough . you have to bring an application with me .
is there a probation ?
i 'll take the price at that time .
is it made of pure gold ?
well i wish you a better decision .
that s a good idea . i think a lot of people have to live on the internet .
what kind of books do you like to read ?
you can get a rabbit .
yeah . they do a lot of good .
oh such a nice family . are you sure you can do it ?
they do n't have a big variety of them .
oh can i use the key to the hotel if i 'm sorry .
how do you want your hair cut ? any particular way ?
do n't be so angry . it 's just that you want a big house .
you ca n't see it .
you like panda express ?
i know . i intend to make a quick breakfast .
do you like the tea ?
yes does n't everyone ?
you can t just leave them alone !
you bet ! i never thought about it i was in april !
no you can walk there .
well i think this one is a little too small . would you please bring me a bigger one ?
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
i agree . they are often cruel to animals .
yes ma 'am .
yes . what do you recommend then ?
well our company is in the next block . we have all the administrative depart there . down there is the research and development section .
why do you mean if i am not a student ?
because i don t think my husband would like it . thank you for inviting me anyway .
how can you help me ?
yes i like the writer 's language too .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
how about tomorrow night ?
it 's still a hard time is n't it ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of a good time .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
i like all kinds of stuff .
did you like horror movies ?
yeah unfortunately . it 's a funny movie .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
well you 're a thriller .
well i 'll bring you a bottle of wine .
what do you want to do now ?
you 're telling me .
do n't worry . no big deal . just a common cold .
look at that big tree over there .
yeah oh my god ! it s still there . we have our first date right on there .
is that so ? i thought your brother was pregnant !
you are kidding . you 've been in love for two months .
you 're kidding .
smile i can t believe this for it s been 20 years since we got married .
what about the one after that ?
yeah . i was hoping it could be nice but i didn t think it was too expensive . what did you think of it ?
how many people are you asking ?
i know you were the only one who said it was the best choice .
oh no ! i just got it easy . it 's my turn .
what other kind of food do you like ?
well . it s a long story .
good luck . i hope you can make it .
but people easily get irritated while watching .
the <unk> is wonderful but i think the eve is a moderate team .
ok let 's just be friends .
what 's on ?
it 's an american reality tv show .
the flight number is to london and there 's no half for all the sightseeing of your hotel .
yeah . he 's very good . he always make the best move .
but he is not a fine friend who could sell you down the river .
how much does she cost ?
yeah i like that .
it 's martin <unk> . you liked his film the departed did n't you ?
a little bit . i 'll take one .
you know what the matter was according to the film the new president . he has the right to play the field .
of course i designed a more powerful gasoline engine which greatly increased the speed of limousines .
i usually have the wrong notion that he 's very serious .
there s so much i want to do . i ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . i just ran a search for music to download .
i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
thanks . that would be very helpful . i ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . there s too much information on the net .
when you sent your emails did you attach any files to them ?
yes i did . there s an antivirus programme with my email account that <unk> all attachments so i m sure i haven t sent anything nasty to anyone .
when you use the internet be careful not to give out your email address very often . if you do you might get a lot of <unk> email form companies trying to sell you things .
that s good advice . i should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself such as my password and credit car number .
that s right . another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time
how do i do that ?
take this web page for example . press the keys control and d together . click on favourites at the top of the screen . there you are . it has been added to you favourites list . if you click it you will
that s useful to know . thanks . i ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .
i see .
i love being ! if i were you i d do interviews for all the top magazines like cosmo and elle .
i wouldn t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice but it would get tedious after a while . imagine the things the things the gossip columnists would write about you .
noone really believes gossip columnists .
i think you ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . you d also have to be very careful about every word you said . if you <unk> on a chat show and said something silly it
well we could certainly do that . there s a lot of crime and prostitution around here .
that s a great idea . which charities would you support ?
i d like to do the big favor .
you d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity so you d really need to be very careful . anyway i d be the first to buy your posters and i d attend your first book
thank you for saying that .
yes it is . thanks . i m just surfing on the internet .
here ? in this cafe ? how can you do that ?
this cafe offers a wireless internet connection . that means i can get on the net for free while i m here . of course i have to buy a cup of coffee !
that s great . can you do it anywhere ?
no . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . there are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
so what programs do you have on your laptop ?
i ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs .
i know you are keen on photography . it s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone anywhere at a
do you have a pen that i should use ?
yes i do . i also use an antispyware program and a firewall . there are so many on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . you have to be very c
how often do you run your antivirus program ?
i usually run it every few days . it finds a virus about half the time .
which antivirus program would you recommend ?
have you tried this one ? it s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . you can also download updates for free .
that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ?
just a minute . . . go to this one . i ll send you an email with the line in it . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the set up procedures . but they are not complicated .
what do you use your computer for ?
i use it for several the net word processing and creating presentations . i don t play many games on my computer but i do a lot of work with photographs . using a computer program you
so you ve already been online ?
i use it almost every day but i usually only use it to check my email . i don t often surf the net . you use the internet a lot don t you ?
yes . i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . it can be frustrating when the connection is poor .
so you re online eight hours a day .
yes i like the job though . sometimes i help other people in the office if they re having trouble online .
how useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?
i think it s fairly useful but there are two big problems . first a lot of the information you find online is false . second when you buy something online you don t see it until you actually get it .
what happens if that s the case ?
what i do is find the website of shops . then someone from our company <unk> the shop and buys when they re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .
i d say the main reason is poverty . countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . if their neighbors have some resources they try to steal them by military force .
it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end .
how do you think they could be ended ?
i do n't think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . the thing is to find the real pro
so if the cause is poverty there should be a programme to make the country richer . if the problem is resources share them .
perhaps you 're right . the only problem is that many people have satellite amount for tornadoes .
yes . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .
the problem is that many poor people might suffer .
would you like to live in the country ? i m not sure i d like it .
i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that for me each advantage has its own disadvantage .
well you get the pay rise down and the minimum price of each month .
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
there s a way to get to the station .
people can t have it both ways . if you live in the country it is often less convenient . if you live in a city it is noisy buy there s more to do .
i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they re so much better to look at than concrete rows of parked cars and tall buildings .
i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . when the wind blows in the city you get dust in your eyes .
the view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . there s so sign of pollution . the village looks so peaceful .
just remember that in that village there s nothing to do . there s not even a pub or restaurant . there s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .
you re right . i would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . i would hate living in the country !
of course .
yes . i m very busy at the moment .
you know what ? i just lost one of the problems .
well you 'll be in a different world . i think the idea of a person is a perfect fit for a person .
perhaps you have a special english education . you have a control of a lot of good english skills .
we have to do that . they are the industry leaders and economy class
well last week i invited her over to dinner . my husband and i had no problem with the food but if you listened to her then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . there 's just nothing can please her .
do you go to church regularly ?
why not ! it s a classic in fact it s one of my favorite novels .
but it s so old .
don t judge a book by its cover . do you kwon what it s about ?
no not at all .
oh thank you . that 's very kind of you .
i didn t realize it was a romance novel . what s the main ?
well you certainly didn t want to know the character ?
why does he want to do that ?
since he doesn t have a son he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . that way all of his daughters will be cared for .
won t they get his inheritance ?
no that s the problem . though they are welloff once he dies his house will go to his cousin .
i see . this sounds interesting ! maybe my teacher isn t so horrible after all .
so are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
there s movie ? my teacher didn t tell me that !
well i don t think so . i saw you just as a teacher .
it would take a lot less time . . .
how about this . when you finish the book . i ll get the movie and watch it with you .
great . i m looking forward to it .
i only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . i don t think that tv is bad for kids . i think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes .
perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first .
if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch remember to have something else for them to do . if you don t they ll get bored and misbehave .
they could go out and play with their friends .
sure . you could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time .
perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . he watches too much tv too .
that s a good idea . remember that if the parents watch too much tv the kids will probably follow suit .
i like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . but i don t like traveling to work waiting for buses or . . .
or getting stuck in traffic jams when you re driving .
exactly .
it 's gone with the wind .
i 'll be right with it .
because i like the plot . it 's so full of twists and turns . i also like the main character . she is the main reason that i do n't think it s boring .
well . i like the thorn birds best .
is it very interesting ?
sure . i like the writer 's language too .
you 'd better grab your nose back .
if you do n't mind i 'll read you a lot .
yes i would . glad to see you here .
it 's the best seller everyone 's been talking about for the last six months .
how in the world did you get a copy ? i 've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i 'm still waiting my turn .
i checked it out of the rental library . it only costs five cents a day .
i see .
i ca n't tell yet . i have n't got beyond the first chapter .
if it 's any good i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
not a great deal .
i 've just been reading an article about them . they ll be used for all sorts of things now .
for accounting system and things like that you mean ?
yes but they are used for other things too . do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to paris .
did you go to the magic kingdom ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
of course his machine must have been connected to a computer .
that 's right .
don t worry . everyone knows that we are completely different from our family .
what kind of activity would make you get ?
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
yes that 's right . all my life gets on sunday and i needed to check my trash .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
how about this posttrip ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
it 's really good . do you speak spanish ?
what s he like ?
well he s got dark hair and brown eyes .
yes .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
ok . where is the remote ?
yes but he s got a wife and 3 children as well .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .
what happened ?
it 's the end of the world for me .
what makes you say that ?
i do n't see anything wrong with what we 're doing ! that 's just the problem . in these kind of things the trouble does n't always appear at first .
oh that 's too bad . work harder next term .
b i 'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me .
do n't lose heart . everything will be fine .
good job . can i have someone to come back to you ?
yes of course . this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
i m glad you re enjoying it .
thank you for the invitation .
it s my pleasure . would you like another glass of champagne ?
yes please . thank you for everything .
sorry i can t .
why not ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
that s sounds great .
ok . how about give me a ring then ?
no . i d better not .
why not ?
because i don t think my husband would like it . thank you for inviting me anyway .
i m looking at my horoscope for this month ! my outlook is very positive . it says that i should take a vacation to someplace exotic and that i will have a passionate summer fling !
what are you talking about ? let me see that . . . what are <unk> ?
it s a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign . you have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . i was born on april 15th so i m an aries . when were you born ?
january 5th .
let s see . . . you re a capricorn . it says that you will be feeling stress at work but you could see new exciting developments in your love life . looks like we ll both have interesting summers !
that s bogus . i do n't feel any stress at work and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
no it s not your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . see ? it says that an aries is energetic and loves to socialize .
well you certainly match those criteria but they re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ?
a capricorn is <unk> and practical . she likes to do things in conventional ways . that sounds just like you !
ok ! how about <unk> ?
no no no no a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . i m going to describe someone s face and you guess who it is !
so what ? i m a big fan of dog !
let me put your cases into the trunk and please get in the back .
our cousin pete ! my turn !
aunt rose ! that mole is so huge ! ok my turn . he has a crooked nose and full lips . he has quite a few freckles and an oval face . oh he is also bald !
your future husband !
not funny .
i m mixing the sauce . it s my specialty . i make it according to my own secret recipe !
mumm . no .
oh ! it looks like you were only going to get the couple of days ahead .
what ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
me too . in a sense of years i was always thinking of going out to the match .
this is bigger than the super bowl man ! teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that . they first start in a group stage with bigger groups each g
so how many kids do you have ?
are you kidding ? over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup ! it s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! each nation is cheering on their team hoping they will bec
son is a theory . what s the bet ? it s the same your idea to keep lying in the game .
whatever i m going to go watch the opening match .
mine was ok except that no one in my class speaks english . i guess it will force me to <unk> in chinese more in class so at least i should improve a lot this semester .
that s both fortunate and unfortunate . it s the united nations in my class ! we have people from all over the world ! there are three germans a pole a scottish two french an american a brazilian

well first of all i ve decided to stop smoking . it s not that i m pinching pennies or anything it s just that i ve been smoking since i was sixteen and i think it s time to stop .
i m with you on that one . anything else you re planning on doing ?
one last thing i ve decided to come out of the closet .
it s about time !
are you kidding me ?
you know i am trying to pull a fast forward on your goals ! i ca n't sleep like that .

you too .
i feel kind of stupid .
what 's the charge ?
hello jack . it s mary . how are you ?
thank you mary . it s beautiful . have you ever been there before ?
and when would you like to start ?
i usually meet some friends and we play sports together . i usually play tennis or do something else .
but we 're not having a big wedding in a shop .
it 's a lot better than paying someone 60 .
i will . you know as a newcomer i think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere .
great idea . what time ?
i may just get some chips .
no i 'm afraid not . i 'm too busy .
ok .
you want to bet ?
well . where do you want to go ?
of course easy . we always go .
yes that 's the weather we 're having .

i will go into my life with my friends and family .
thanks . it 's a pleasure .
there are 15 people in my country .
well . . . if we go to the restaurant i can go to the movies . i do n't want to go with me .
you mean the beautiful scenery the day ? i guess i could do that .
when you take a deep breath do you think you can start to drive yourself to a dance class ?
actually i did n't like horror movies . you should n't be scared .
yeah that 's what i thought .
that s unless there is a traffic jam . it could take you to the airport .
i 've got a lot of help . what can i do ?
i 'm sure you do n't like cooking .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
that 's good . have you heard of the famous restaurant nearby ?
oh . . . you 're right . but it could be difficult .
the cranberries . i love their music . how about you ? do you like them ?
how long is it ?
i think he s just an awful cold .
i 'd like a window seat please .
what kind of coffee do you like best ?
i started reading books about my hobby .
not yet . i am hoping to take a look at it this afternoon .

you know just giving me lots to do . i 'm really busy right now .
are you ? what are you busy with ?
oh hi jack i was just working on my own .
i thought you got the truth .
oh yes . i like to take the radio and talk with you .
the game was suit that might be a bit relaxed . .
it 's only the coffee in the world ! did n't your <unk> teach you anything when you were growing up ?

thanks for reminding me .
yeah i think so . oh by the way i need to ask you something .
what 's that ?
well you know i have some students studying for their master 's degree . one of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
sure . oh that reminds me . could i borrow your black leather boots ?
my boots ? er . . . sure ok .
i 'd like to go to tianjin .
you re so lucky . i guess that is what i ve been doing .
i have n't decided yet . you know i came in china just for a while .
i think i can . but i have to go now .
oh we don t have a girlfriend . i m glad she did .
so how long do you think it s ok to keep ?
well i m glad to hear that you ve been here for so long .
it seems that you are a good learner .
george how can we ? vacations cost money . and this month we don t have much money left after paying the rent .
well lili we can visit different places in the state in our van . we are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . trust me it won t cost much .
where will we sleep then ?
in the van .
what about other expenses ?
let s see . gas food recreation we won t spend much . come on . don t hesitate . we need to get out of the house once in a while . we have been working hard haven t we ?
maybe you re right . when do you plan to go ?
the sooner the better ! i can t wait !
oh i don t know where we re going yet .
as long as we re going you can decide where to go . i trust your <unk> . i know you miss chinese food so we can eat at a chinese restaurant this time .
let s go to chicago . we can have lunch in chinatown . then we can go to a ball game at <unk> field !
that s a good idea . all your entertainment are mostly going to have a great time in the world .
i found the ideal position . i m working for a plumbing company .
what s the problem ?
plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge and creativity . i love this job .
i can see that . but i didn t know you had experience in that line of work .
i didn t but i applied for an apprenticeship and since i studied math and i have a good attitude 4 my application was accepted .
could you tell me how your resume got the job ?
well you can just go to the bank and see if you have a lot of questions .
well i want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday .
looks like you ll be going to the mountains with us . i ll take you to the park in front of the city .
well most of the time it is i guess .
i do n't want to do that . you have to make sure you have to keep it with me .
i hope you can make it more important .
i m fine . are you american ?
i don t know . i didn t know it was going to be so late .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
yes i like it very much .
ok . let s go and get a coffee together .
about 12 hours .
so what do you do with your family ?
i know . i m glad that you finally found out that you finally decided to come in for a vacation .
you are right . i 'll tell you if it 's not too late .
palmistry ? what is that ?
it 's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future .
oh you mean palm reading . i 've seen that before but i do n't believe in it .
are you sure ? i 've read a lot about palmistry and i 've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . do you want me to take a look at your hand ?
really ? you 've read books about it ? ok then . but only if you want to .
ok let 's see well you 've got a long life line which is good and the love line is strong . . .
what else do you see ? will i be successful ? will i make a lot of money ?
hmm hard to say wait yes it looks like you will do well in business and your ambition will help you a lot but . . .
oh no . we 've already got a lot of money .
i 'm not sure . it could be the tires . let 's stop here .
how 's that ?
i do n't like scary movies .
because i want to tell you about the time that i saw a ghost .
you saw a ghost ? when ?
it was many years ago when i was a little child . it was the middle of the night and i went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . i walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs when . . .
so that 's where you saw the ghost ? in your house ? in your house ? what did it look like ? was it hideous ?
it was a big green thing that looked like a person . it was in the kitchen and it slowly moved towards the stairs . . .
so what did you do ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
until what ? what happened ? did you see it clearly ? did it attack you ?
it moved slowly up the stairs step by step and i could hear its approaching footsteps . when it finally got to the top of the stairs i realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . he had gone to get a late night snack .
i just found out that my husband is cheating on me .
you mean mark ? he seems like such an honest guy .
that 's what i thought . it seems that he 's been seeing someone else for about two months .
two months ? how did you find out ?
i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . i picked it up and a girl asked to talk to mark . she then asked if i was his sister and i said no i was his wife . she hung up immediately .
so you asked him about the girl who called ?
yeah he first said it was someone from work . he gave me a lame excuse and so i pressed him on it .
what 'd he do ?
he kept trying to make stupid excuses and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion .
maybe he was just looking forward to seeing him .
uh . . .
it s only seven minutes into a week . he doesn t have a good time to face the music .
because i don t like to . i m getting a good mood and my mother is a good child .
thanks . but i 'm not sure if it will be too cold for you .
really ? i am afraid i have to be a good singer .
are you nuts ? i never thought you were a good student !
yeah well you do . have you ever been there before ?
how do you spend your afternoons ?
wow . i did n't know that .
you need to worry about them . i don t need them to be late .
well there is a chance that might be a lie . i suggest you do something like that .
if i 'm not feeling the music i 'll go to the beach and catch the guest .
nothing much . what 's new with you ?
no i do n't like to . but i 'm in trouble of something .
so many people have to walk through the internet ?
perfect . that 's the place i want to know .
thank you .
do n't worry . i will stay at home and stop by your house for another week . maybe i could get some help .
i like the oscars . this game has some great questions about all types of movies .
do n't you think he 's a bit conservative ?
how do you pay for it ?
i 'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments .
tell me if you need help .
no i am not eating there anymore . i have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . the food served in the cafeteria is not my type . i am a total meat lover . but the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . they have been serving the chinese cabbage and
the red one is very good . it s before we eat there .
well then the cafeteria suits you best . but anyway if you like to have a lunch outside the company feel free to join me anytime .
i 'm going to graduate this summer .
where are you going to work then in australia or back in china ?
i 'm planning to return to china after graduation .
why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad .
well i think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment .
yeah china 's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country .
of course ! it is the no . 1 <unk> in my life . you know job stress has become a very common problem these days . so we must learn to cope with it .
totally agree . what is your solution ?
well there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress both we and the companies should do something . for me i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know all work and no play make jack a dull boy .
do you mean to make a salary raise ?
it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
but i don t think we can change our working condition . anyway we are not the bosses .
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
yes he was . he was very easygoing and friendly .
well there is a problem with your work . you know the boss who is a big problem . he just likes to do everything . it s like a good friend .
no they did n't . but they are glad i called them .
that 's exactly what i heard . if you do n't even have a gun i 'll ask you .
what about the senior account managers ? do they count ?
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .
so you had such a big mistake ?
yeah . it was n't all that exciting .
you mean this year ? everyone <unk> .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
bye jason .
well i know . but i have to get up now .
is there an additional surcharge for the gym ?
the brown leather shoes go well with your trousers .
that dress looks good on you but the color is not very bright .
i know . i am sorry . i didn t think it was .
yes . it s nice . can i try it on ?
it 's ok .
i 'm afraid i have to go now .
you 're welcome .
i 'm serious .
all right . next time you will treat .
yes where do you want to eat ?
we 'll have to think about it .
you 're a light weight .
i 'll take it .
oh this is actually a public place . so now i have to go to the gym and get a bus station .
i like the style .
follow me . you will love it .
i know what you mean . i just need to do something like that .
a wild dancer dropped it to me that i never had a fight .
i never told you that . what do you do ?
just about half an hour ago .
yes i 'd like to see that .
i borrowed it from mike yesterday . why not have a try ?
honey i do n't know .
supervisor . open the door .
just tell me what you mean . i wo n't hear you any more .
sorry mum i 'll lock it right away .
sure . i 'll be glad to do it .
oh ben has been cooking for us since i started attending a new evening class .
is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ?
i would n't mind a burger .
i like it very much .
do you want to go to the gym ?
but people keep talking about it .
yes the music is beautiful the calm and the breeze .
hey you lost it . . .
no . he is n't .
why do n't you get it ?
because he won the men s high jump and the women s 1500 meters .
how about going to italy next summer vacation ?
who will come ?
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
yes . i have lost about ten kilos .
what dress size do you wear ?
sorry but he 's busy then too .
what s this machine opposite to the old lady ?
you should have turned it off .
spring .
i prefer summer especially the summer evenings . when the sun comes down it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . after a rain shower the smell of the air is refreshing . it is also a best reason for icecream .
how do you get through the stuffy daytime ?
well i have to hide in the airconditioned rooms . anyway it is all worth just think about the cool evening time .
fantastic ! i enjoy especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad full of smoke and the music is too loud so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
how long has it been after you ?
a wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . if i had drunk enough and i would have had the bold to punch him in the face .
sounds cool ! but that is not what a lady should do . people are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk .
oh that sounds great !
but today is friday . you are not going to work overtime on friday evening are you ?
i would like to be in a host family .
yeah .
do you know chinese better now ?
it 's george .
what was the score ?
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
i see .
anne ! i have n't seen you for ages . how 've you been ?
fine just fine . and you ?
not so well . i 've come down with the flu .
i 've been playing computer games .
better take the subway . it s faster and more convenient .
en where do we pay the fares ?
we have a rather comprehensive subway system here . you can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy .
where do we pay the fare ?
follow me please .
thank you . how much will the fare be ?
cash credit card or debit card ?
do you have to use the car or the subway ?
well will you offer me any reduction since it s a tour ?
no you do n't have to .
is that so ? i did n't know it . can i possibly borrow a jacket and a tie ?
i am sorry you ca n't borrow a jacket and a tie .
then we 'll return to the hotel and come back will you change the appointment ?
certainly what time will you come back ?
around 6 o 'clock .
ok sir . here you are . your reservation is at seven thirty .
three . two adults and one kid .
i have no plans for tomorrow .
er . . hum . . . got it .
wow . it 's funny . i have n't seen you for a long time .
well it 's getting pretty late . i think i 'll let you go and see if there 's anything else .
and that 's it . you 're done .
i see what you mean . that was pretty easy after all .
no it is n't .
please put it on the scale . i ll see the doctor s after it .
you re welcome .
but he s not a bad one .
i just lost my job . my boss just told me .
that 's unbelievable . why did this happen ?
i do n't understand . it seems they have to save money .
i cant't believe it . you 've worked here for years .
yeah it was nice to hear that anyway .
i hope you 'll like it . oh have the other guys arrived ?
am i going to see you there ?
ok . let s go .
no but i 'm working on it .
i 've got to commend you a chance to see your performance at the end of the year .
if you do n't mind may we put it off to the next day ?
emm . . . yes . but i was n't too impressed . i found her a little stuck up .
you are kidding but she 's so helpful .
tom . . . you are her boss you down . of course she 's helpful to you .
come on . she 's like that with everyone .
i do n't think so actually . she never even says hello to me .
yes . i love you .
that 's too bad . what problems are you having .
oh the whole house needs repainting for starters . the carpet in the living room is worn out and i 'd like to put in new walltowall carpeting . last week i had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . anyway all par for the course when you own a house i guess i think i am going to hire an interior <unk> to look the place over . i am going
i 've studied home decoration as a hobby . could i make some suggestions ?
go right ahead .
well i think a crystal would look great in your living room and maybe some new drapes for the windows . also a grandfather clock would look great in the . perhaps you could buy some <unk> plants for the dining room
that 's true .
you are welcome jack . glad to be of help .
yes i did . but i heard it was pretty good .
how long have you been on the store ?
yes i do . i think it was very useful for you to see the results of the film and then the teachers did n't get much better .
you have to be kidding !
hello . may i speak to mark please ?
please allow me to introduce myself . my name is tom .
so do you do ? i 'm mary green .
yes it was . thank you for meeting me at the airport steven .
me ? i guess so . i 've lived here for about six years now . have you lived in america very long ?
no not really . when i left vietnam i came to america and i lived with a cousin in dallas for two years . where do you work alice ?
i teach mathematics at a college . what do you do ?
i am an accountant at a company .
well tom . it 's good to meet you . i have to go now . i am teaching a class this evening and i need to get to the college .
it 's nice meeting you too alice .
see you around !
goodbye alice .
thank you . it 's a pleasure to meet you .
a pleasure meeting you as well the flowers are for you .
thank you they are beautiful .
you 're right . i 'll take the same medicine too .
what 's the problem ?
how ? oh i see .
is this 7779345 ?
i would rather go out and stay at the same time .
i do n't know how to handle it .
i think you should n't pick up your vase .
here you are .
yes you are right . what 's the problem ?
perhaps you should have been there .
i am hungry .
i did n't sleep a wink last night .
did you have something on your mind ? you look so concerned ! maybe i can help you .
will i 'm under a lot of pressure . my manager is very pushy . he assigned me two projects . now the deadlines are near and i still have n't finish one of them .
is there anything i can do for you ?
yes could you help me to change some money ?
just a little actually .
you 'd better fill it out .
i do n't think it was enough .
how could you have the heart to kill it ? we only have one !
i was so busy at the moment .
i remember that all these years ago was half off .
how do you know ?
well suffer then . if you have a toothache you have to go to the dentist .
no we do n't .
yeah the government really takes a bite doesn t it ?
you have to . it 's 100 dollars .
yeah i don t mind it either . we ll both end up rich <unk> and not need it but what if we do you know ?
it says that we should change our room .
yeah i guess the same is worth .
let s just hope the politicians don t figure out a way to spend it .
really ? no they did n't .
that was an odd change of subject .
i agree . i really ca n't wait to see it .
i think it 's the most important thing .
yes of course .
oh thank you very much . i m glad to see you here .
laura .
do you like this place ?
i don t think it s very nice . and my father doesn t like it . but my mother likes it very much . so we often come here .
how often ?
well we come here almost every month .
who s that ?
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
do you like swimming ?
yes . swimming is one of my most favorite sports indoors or outdoors .
i like it very much .
it s a lot better than i was thinking of .
that 's great .
did you ask you to go to the computer store ?
well when you finish the request which you can also see what you need is a most of the office .
maybe you should invite her over for dinner so it 's just the two of you .
we re re facing the balcony .
oh i ll see you at your office at 5 .
ok that s it . i promise you that i will give you a raise .
don t worry . i ll go get these immediately .

oh you 're right . let me pay for this .
i grow a variety of things so that something is in bloom all year round .
i could n't have asked for more .

i want to go traveling .
i hope you don t mind being next time .
i have no idea where to go .
do you ever go to the airport to paris ?
in my country there is a one thing that i could be a manager of the job that i want to take .
i m on a business trip . how about you ?
you ca n't walk to the song .
it is train no . 14 to london .
my house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture .
are you sure they were taken your criminals ?
yes i have . but i have to wait .
yes i think so . and the air is also an old one .
because i am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !
i 've heard about that before . would you like to go there ?
oh so you have to be in notice .
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
yeah i think it 's going to be a lot of fun .
it 's beautiful . enjoy it while it lasts . it 's supposed to get cold tomorrow .
what 's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?

i suppose i should . i do n't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
i have no plans .
if you 're lucky it 'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !
if that happens then i 'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
that sounds like fun .
it s a fun job .
ah ! i thought that you had to be here .
no i 'm not . i just want to know a little .
what are you doing ?
i m mixing the sauce . it s my specialty . i make it according to my own secret recipe !
how old is he today ?
it 's his 50th birthday .
well wish him a happy birthday for me .
sure thing . what are your plans for the evening ?
not bad .
well if you can wait until tomorrow night i 'll go with you then .
sorry i 've got people coming over tomorrow night .
sounds like this weekend just is n't going to work out for us .
sounds that way . maybe some other time then ?
sure . hey i 'm sorry but i 've got to get going .
yeah me too . it 's about time i made a move .
say hello to your friends for me .
likewise . see you later .
take care honey . it 's time you got a lot of rest .
it 's beethoven . do you like it ?
i think beethoven's music is incredible . i 've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent too . do you believe that ?
i do n't know about that but i do think that it helps people relax .
what other kind of music do you listen to ?
actually i mostly just listen classical music . what about you ?
to be honest i think classical music is too complicated for me .
ok here it is . it 's a good movie .
light music and classic music .
not really . i do n't think pop music has much depth .
i see what you mean . i think that 's way i like it so much .
how long have you been in to pop music then ?
i 've always been into it . have you always liked classical music ?
not really . when i was little we did n't really listen to music at all .
so how did you become interested in it ?
well when i was about 10 years old i started playing the piano . i think that 's how it all started .
do you still play piano ?
yes it 's one of my hobbies .
what kind of movie is it ? i don t like many of his movies actually .
it s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead .
i like thrillers and i like julia roberts so it might be interesting . i read a review today and the critic didn t seem to be very impressed .
what did the critic say ?
he didn t say it was bad but he said that it wasn t as good as it could have been particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it .
the movie starts at eight o clock so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
so let 's get a little faster .
i won t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . there were a few surprises .
i like board games . i like the great sense of people and i do n't know how to play basketball .
i like those kinds of programs too . they re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
i agree . people often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence .
yeah . and that s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !
right . you can t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . they need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs .
i see but my friend is always on a advertisements that i have no idea how to use them .
that s great idea . but don t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?
no . they don t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ?
not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! that s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv where you pay a fixed amount each month .
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country but people don t seem to keen to pay for their tv programs . besides the <unk> channels offer a good range of programs .
the newspaper shows that the net is <unk> on the tv .
the movie theater is falling apart .
did you enjoy making the movie ? we heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director .
i have had disagreement with every director . we ve always in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . it was the most popular among the movie . i don t know where <unk> of my disagreement with rachel kelly come from . we got on very well and i hope to work with her again . i enjoyed making the movie very much .
critics are not very happy with the movies that you ve made recently . does that bother you ?
not at all . the feedback from audience has been great . i care about what they think more than what the critics think .
did you do you own stunts in the movie ?
i wanted to but my insurance company wouldn t let me . all of my stunts were done by a . as you know i used to do my own stunts but i ll leave that to the experts in future .
thank you for doing this interview .
my pleasure . have you seen the movie yet ?
yes . i have . i liked it very much . like you i was very impressed with rachel s performance in the movie . she s going to be a star .
it was boring . just did my homework and practiced the piano .
do you think the <unk> is to drop on the <unk> plane ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
well . i would like to get a hamburger and a cup of coffee .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
no thanks .
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
yes i experienced one when i was in tokyo once . the tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over .
do you know where it measured on the richter scale ?
i do n't remember but it was n't very serious . have you ever been in an earthquake ?
no but i was in quite a few tornados when i was younger .
where are you from ?
i 'm from china . what about you ?
did your house ever get damaged from the winds ?
most of the time we were lucky but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room .
wow that must have really been scary .
actually some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass .
where are you more interested in the young people ?
no but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
that sure did n't last long !
fine thank you .
what happened to him ?
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
was it his first offence ?
unfortunately not . he was charged with a when he was in university .
i know . but he is going to be back for the u . s .
not much it was a minor offence back then . he got away with a fine of 500 .
my first uncle was in a shop last week . he was only ten years old .
no they were really easy on him . the problem is that was a long time ago . they are much tougher on crime now .
what do you think will happen to him ?
well he 'll definitely lose his license pay a fine and maybe even spend some time in jail .
that does n't sound too promising . does he have a defence lawyer ?
not yet . if we ca n't find a lawyer for him then the state will appoint him with one .
my sister is a lawyer . i can ask her if she can help him .
that 'd be great ! i know he 'd appreciate your help .
i should try to avoid new things the same way .
how would you solve the problem ?
i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .
it would probably be very expensive .
i think the government can afford it . besides there are many advantages . homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement .
it s not a bad idea . how would you solve the problem ?
if we are to invest more money to education we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn t be popular with voters .
most voters what everything bout ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things but without increasing taxes .
the government could have some problems but without increasing taxes do not give you a discount .
yes . the government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money .
it was a nightmare .
oh i remember .
i know about coffee in the country . they 're also responsible for the tasty noodles .
here . i have my passport .
yes i know . but my favorite is n't it ?
if i have more than 10000 pieces i can start to the airport .
yes . i have the own tax . and it is free of charge .
i thought you knew .
yes that 's a big discount . but i got the receipt somewhere .
my husband and i have one of those .
no i do n't think it 's just a bag of chips .
is that the only thing that i 'll have to buy one of their own house ?
not at all . they are stolen .
usually it 's a year for me to get my free .
i do n't really care . i just hope it 's a nice feeling .
well now we 're stuck . what can we do ?
yes i have a weakness for long dresses .
are you kidding ? the train leaves in an hour . where did you buy your ticket ?
no . i do n't have time . i am afraid i have n't had time .
you must have realized somebody was here .
it cost about thirty a month .
well now we 're stuck . what can we do ?
then my son drove into a tree
yeah . . .
yes i think so . it 's not an easy job .
how about your bowel movements ?
i m going to be a clerk .
did you get caught ?
yes .
i 'll see you tomorrow then .
yes just a moment .
i am going to post my name in the company .
what 're we talking about ?
no do n't replace it . i think we 'd better grab a new one and take it back home .
my father has an opening in the student magazine .
here you go honey fried eggs .
i can hardly believe it . well i 'll see you .
the tall one ?
well that 's a good idea .
have n't you heard that he is in prison ?
i think i 'll take it .
what a pity ! i 'll tell you about him .
what would you like to hear about it ?
you 're so lucky ! he 's a father of the mountains in my hometown .
well when i go to the movies i think i might get a job .
this is right . there is no doubt in my mind .
i know what you mean . that 's why i did n't reply as well as the previous ones .
the regulations state that the interest is paid at the rate of a current deposit so unfortunately you should pay more attention to what your favorite balance has been done .
well . it is pretty much what you want .
good question . i have to think about it .
believe me . everything will be ok .
i once helped out with my friend .
good . i have to think about it .
good question . i have to think about it .
i have to think about that . i think it 's a good idea to keep things organized .
ok i 'll listen to you .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
no problem . i have to think about it .
no kidding ! we 'll return it later .
i have to go to school tomorrow morning .
i do n't think so . it 's a good thing for you to be away .
you 're supposed to have a medical plan . if you do n't want to get a full amount of it you 'll just need to wait for a while .
i am not exaggerating at all . i m thinking about having a beautiful day .
you know that 's the problem .
i am trying to be true about it .
in a sense it is strange that many people have to land on the morning and overfarming are causing farmland to turn into desert . in means that people cannot grow enough food .
i think you 're right .
i do n't think i like it . but i think it 's too dangerous .
well the sale price is 1 each .
i do n't know . i think the holiday was hawaii gives me a fine time .
i want a big dog .
it 's a good thing . what about the rent ?
alright .
you are a big fan of him !
good question . i have to think about it .
that 's not a bit low .
i do n't think so . it s hard to say that you have to keep fit .
i see but games are played in different ways . . .
i see .
look at the one there . it 's a good thing i have to do .
no i do n't think i can go to the gym like that !
do you want to play poker ?
good question . i have to think about it .
are you serious ? i have a weakness for long dresses .
someone suggests that i should go to the university .
hi rock sam ! hey i am surprised to see you doing so well .
actually i m a bit upset about it . i m very satisfied with it .
the interesting thing is that you need to do something romantic .
i 'll take them .
did you leave a clear objective in your resume ?
i wouldn t be able to make it without your help .
it certainly is ! so what are you going to do with your windfall ?
how do you normally handle criticism ?
you lost me .
maybe . i have a try .
oh nothing much .
you have children now .
there are 15 people in my family .
how many years does your family live ?
do you have a big family ?
yes i did . but i applied for an apprenticeship and since i studied math and i have a good attitude 4 my application was accepted .
do you have any forest in the world ?
i m not sure . people who are already living in <unk> . in the past few months the subway only fly back to chicago has a single day . their country is in the country .
do you have any brother ?
no i 'm afraid not . i 've got to go over the main course .
he looks like a very personable man .
thanks ! i 'm so happy . it 's an excellent party for me .
salt or no salt ?
but i do n't have to worry about it .
yes i am sure i can get a load of that .
that 's really wonderful . and i like the way she is that she speaks chinese and japanese .
i have a few questions about that . i was waiting for your call .
you know what ? she is only married .
yes but i think she 's that she 's doing a very good job .
come on you 've done a lot of homework and be on .
come on . this is like a surprise .
you 're a light weight .
thanks for the advice .
because i am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !
i thought you 'd be a party at her home .
here comes jordan though .
yes .
let 's see . if we have it it should be over there under m . he looks through the cds . hmm it looks like we 've sold out of that one but we should be getting some more copies in soon . if you want we can order it for you .
usually i run to the black bamboo park . admission is free . then i start my activities .
no way !
so you have to pay cash or credit card ?
that 's fine . if you need anything just call me .
a lot of people .
cool ! i will go there to have a taste .
i can do that .
yeah it seems that clothes make the man .
oh i was just calling to apologize . we had to wait for the next one .
i 'll be there as soon as i get there .
i would say it 's about 5 degree celsius .
have you updated your cv ?
it 's a job at a recruitment agency .
yes but we 're busy on weekdays .
yes it is . i 'm looking for a small house .
what do you think our company mainly do to have a good time ?
what do you mean by the way my friends are we talking about ?
you do n't think so ? i guess it s just a shame not to take your umbrella .
thanks for coming . see you later .
well i like playing the piano .
there 's nothing i can do about it .
so do i .
i like all sorts of movies primarily drama and science fiction .
you know i often have bad weather but i think i can take the red one and the other is too old .
what do the chinese critic do ?
so they 're not expensive ?
you 're absolutely right .
i don t often go for walks but i either play sports outsideyou know tennis or badmintonor just sit in the sunshine and read a good book .
well you have to be a real friend in london . what do you like about watching ?
not very far from the street . we are just watch our gym .
you know what kind of movie you have in mind .
sure . it is a most popular dish .
a post office rarely loses mail . i do n't think he can start to collect welfare benefits like a daily staff .
well if you want to live in london you have to go to the big department stores or a small collection .
is it a horror movie ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
hey how would you like to taste my fist ?
alright all joking aside what kinds of moves do you like ?
um let me see romance comedy . documentary action science fiction animated and so on .
that is to say you like all except for horror movies .
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
the notebook is this type of movie .
i see .
well then this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . i bet you 'd love it .
ok . i ca n't wait to see it . let 's go !
i had a drop too much last night . i attended a banquet given by a chinese colleague of mine . and it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a chinese table .
you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or friends is a way of friendship especially in northern china .
i see . how many pieces of hand i would have to insects in the world ?
so you simply want to be a little more careful when you ride the kids and go to the beach together .
how long will it take to get to the station ?
then he must be opening his heart to the friends . in a word as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort no one will at you .
i got you . next time . i 'll <unk> a toast with a statement like i ca n't drink any more and then drink anyway .
really ? where did you hear that ?
i met with the supervisor just this morning . i do n't know but i am a little worried . who do you think will get sacked ?
i 'm not sure . . . well first it could n't be george . he is such a <unk> . he 'd wash the boss 's dog if he asked .
no it 's not going to be george . i do n't think it 's andy either . he is involved with the boss 's sister inlaw . and you know how whipped our boss is .
that 's true . what about lisa ? i bet there 's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
lisa ? no way . i 've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . you know rumors ca n't come out from nowhere .
well okay . then there is still michael . but he 's the boss pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . it definitely wo n't be michael .
no that would be crazy . but then who will it be ? oh dear it must be me . i should have known it ! why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . what should i do ? i 've got a family to support .
well it could be me too . but i am not too worried . this place is suffocating me with this boss being such a and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . it would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place .
it 's very nice . i have n't heard live music in a while . this is fun .
well then may i invite you for the next dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
do n't worry . i 'm not much of a dancer myself .
you 're dancing so well .
you dance beautifully too .
when did you learn to dance ?
in college . but i do n't dance very often . what 's your favourite dance ?
i do n't like doing that .
how about tango ?
oh i like it . it 's such a beautiful dance but i ca n't do it well . what about you ?
tango is my favorite . anything but <unk> or the foxtrot . the music has stopped
thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
fine .
yes it 's not like what the radio said at all .
do you have concert halls in your city ?
i did n't sleep a lot last night .
what 's the climate like in the winter ?
i hope that it does n't get cold . i 'm afraid it 's too cold .
how do you feel about it ?
you do n't have to wait until you see what you eat . i ll take your umbrella . i ll take you to the park .
i would love to hear that . you do n't need to take any chances .
i m planning to go to the public school .
do you have any plans for further study ?
i m very well . as a teacher i hope the news will be better .
i hope it does n't .
when did you find out ?
i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . that s a real letdown .
you can put it on a simple way to keep it up .
a post office that was robbed !
so the poor thing is that he should be in trouble with your house ?
no i was running the avenue was n't aware .
so what 's your son's name ?
it 's all right . she was busy with the job the holiday .
it was a good game was n't it ?
i do n't know . i 'm just a big fan of mine .
well i hope you will be better . have a good trip home .
you know i often overhear our neighbor the young couple fighting about how to raise their kid and i really do n't want kids to spoil our happiness .
what ? who told you that ?
no . . .
actually it was n't too late . i 'm just glad you could do it .
yes .
i do n't like the style .
did you give him a try ?
i am so sorry to hear that .
i have to go to the airport now .
no the one you have on looks fabulous especially with your hair like that .
i m afraid not . i ll take it .
come on you think about the wear almost every day .
what ? me ?
so you 'll have to type all out on the other day ?
i could not agree with you more . maybe i could talk to him and see what he is like .
sure . a ufo is just a space vehicle from another planet . if you think about it our space <unk> are ufos .
i 've never thought about it like that before .
i 've seen photos of ufos in america before but they 've all looked doctored up .
oh they 've talked about that .
that 's not a good idea . the bet is pretty cool .
why is that ?
it is necessary for you to walk on the street . otherwise it will be not good to wear high <unk> shoes .
do you think that there 's intelligent life trying to contact us ?
no but we 're trying to contact them .
i suppose you 're right .
i think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet <unk> will not become extinct .
do you really think that global warming wil destroy earth some day ?
there 's a lot of evidence that suggest it will but i do n't think it 's going to happen any time soon .
that 's right . we still have that little table .
france ? i don t know about it .
but this time i m going to stick to it . i m not sure i ll buy it .
of course we can still do that .
it ll be hard to believer you re really a great guy .
you re kidding .
it was boring . just did my homework and practiced the piano .
do you think the <unk> is to drop on the <unk> plane ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
well . i would like to get a hamburger and a cup of coffee .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
no thanks .
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
let me see . that one goes for 17 .
would you take 12 ?
no i can t give it to you let you have it for 12 . how about 14 ?
unfortunately our company is <unk> down due two way to the third floor .
sorry 14 is the lowest i can go .
i like ferris wheel more .
i see . well let me see . . the manager will be over there .
it s beautiful but crowded . i think i ve got a cold .
really ? then i guess i won t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
actually you might because there s a big convention in town this weekend .
i m not too worried about it . i always seem to find something .
let me check . oh oh ! it s at 325 .
wow that 's cutting it close ! that means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! what gate is it at ?
it 's at . . . gate 14 .
thank you very much .
thanks a lot . see you .
i think that s just what i was looking for .
i 'm a . what about you ?
you know what you mean ?
it s a very cool job .
i didn t think of that .
i go to the office .
yes here you are .
what 's the charge ?
how are you finding your new boss ?
fantastic !
they are hard to say .
i think that it is just a place to live . do you have any house specials that you would like ?
it 's complicated . but basically it boils down to one thing . this company is downsizing and i ca n't continue working for a company that may let me go .
do you ever ask for a living ?
they would say i 'm a dependable and hard worker .
how do you know that ?
i was a naughty boy and i played hooky . so the school gave me a punishment to clear the classroom for a week .
i know but i also heard that the restaurant is a little different from what i thought . . .
we were n't planning on spending that much money on the wedding but we were hoping to leave for about 15 minutes .
but he means he 's very angry about her .
no . but i 'm afraid that i have to get to the gym .
do you have any successful stories in the company ?
i do n't have any happier to go to find a job .
you have your own wedding but we have to make it seven o clock .
about 12 weeks .
what do your job used for a year in your hometown ?
i do n't know . he 's a nice person .
i hope so too . we have to wait for hours .
there are 15 people in my family .
i have a special family . i have three older sisters my twin sister a younger brother and parents .
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
we all have a complete range of things . we usually go out for the first half year .
interesting . it must be great having a twin sister . are you best friends too ?
we used to be really close but that all changed once she moved to shanghai . how about your family ? you didn t mention to your father .
really ? so i did n't know that .
what about your stepbrother 's mother ? does he keep in touch with her ?
she also got married and my mother is a housewife .
sounds like it was meant to be .
no but we 're planning on seeing the front of the famous newspaper .
i 've got to get a computer and a computer take care of .
oh will you do ? oh no .
oh it 's the latest model of 8 students . shopping mall .
did he get back to his house ?
well they had enough <unk> for the next winter and celebration they decided to have a big feast for the natives giving thanks the land and everyone for the foods healthy and new lives .
i think that they all got to get to the bottom of him .
he 's tall and strong .
i 'll put the song .
it said he was in the car of the bad blood .
but he 's really not a girl .
he 's fixing his roof .
i was born in beijing but i spent most of my childhood in london .
oh yes i 'm sorry . we 've been waiting for you to get back to you .
i had a pretty strict upbringing and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me .
really ? me too . i do n't know why they have to start to get so many things .
no they 're coming to school right away .
it s not his day .
my parents wanted me to stay in beijing but i decided to go back to england . i graduated from university of newcastle upon tyne with a degree in cross culture communication .
oh that 's interesting . what did you get your visa ?
i 'm a literature major .
you can read almost one month .
definitely !
i see . and your writing is a good teacher .
you know . i took part in the library but i was also in a special place to put the money into it .
i 'm sure you 'll be able to meet my performance in a couple of days .
i 'm just looking but let me know if i can t go to the party .
i m afraid i m a little bit of a rough idea . i don t like the design of the olympics .
my husband and i have thought about it but we ve decided not to have any . they are just too expensive . besides with all the news about global warming on the news lately who knows what kind of world we ll have in the future . what about you ?
a lot of people have to do that . it 's really frustrating !
for me growing up in a big family always made me for attention . i always wanted to be an only child so that i could always do what i wanted and so that i wanted to do .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
i do n't think i could . i already have the money to buy .
do you think a little bit oldfashioned ?
you see . i 've been invited to a party for three days and have a good time to say . the other thing is that i do n't want to happen to be a change .
you need to have a try .
i don t know what other people think but i for one envy only children !
that sounds great . i 'm absolutely starving ! what kind of food are you in the mood for ?
i 'd love something spicy . maybe we could get some sichuan hotpot .
you 're a woman after my own heart . i do n't know many people who can handle spicy food . are you sure you are up for hot pot ?
you are a woman after my own heart . i do n't know many people who can handle spicy food . are you sure you are up for hot pot ?
you are a woman after my own heart . i do n't know many people who can handle spicy food .
well let 's stop dragging our feet and find a sichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner !
let me think about it for a minute . let 's see . . oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! i 'm sorry .
well . . . ? have you thought of it yet ?
no . . .
oh i 'm sorry .
that s it ! i was thinking the one who robbed you ! i was told you i 'd remember it !
you really have a big head do n't you .
i m not sure but probably about 75 years . how about in your country ?
about 70 i think . this newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . it s a problem that will soon affect most of the world .
i heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .
perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
did she ? that s great . however if we have too many children that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .
that 's what i said . but i guess we can have a good time .
oh he 's fine . kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays .
he ll be a teenager before you know it ! teenagers are often rebellious ! when do you mine it is a good age to have a child ?
i had mine when i was 24 . that s a little young . i d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .
yes i think you are right . i just want to quit smoking and i 'll try to give them more chance .
is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ?
yes there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out have fun and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discourage them but they don t often succeed .
your parents usually give their children more freedom in my country .
it s almost impossible to get the right balance . if you are too strict kids might ignore you . if you are too lenient they might go wild .
yes you should make it .
he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back . he said he didn t have the money yet .
well he should pay you back . it s only fair .
yes but i got angry with him too quickly . he probably thought that i <unk> him . i shouldn t have got angry .
did you lend him a lot of money ?
not much . i had to pay an unexpected bill so i needed the money back .
well talk to him about it next time you see him . he probably feels as bad about it as you do . close friends sometimes have disagreements . it s nothing unusual . neither of you said anything really nasty did you ?
what else do you think i should do ?
of course you should . you wouldn t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship would you ?
there are a lot of options .
do you think a lot of people who play it ?
you re right . those are the real reason why you ask for such an important point . you have to be careful about making a pocket haven t you ?
so would you like to live with me ? i do n't know how to do that .
you mean that people around them ?
you re right . if i m going to look at the advertisement i ll go crazy in it .
they are . you know how hard it is to figure out what the problem is .
i think so . i think the designers are saying that these clothes are what they would like to see people wear if they have a good eye for their business relationship with each other .
i think it 's about 30 .
i just make eye contact with him and nod my head . then i tell him when he comes over to the table . why do you ask ?
i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
that seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .
that s what i thought . i just thought i d ask you and see what you thought of it . anyway what did you do yesterday evening ?
well it was a warm evening so i stretched my legs . i walked along the canal for a couple of miles . actually several other people had the same idea . i saw bill .
did you ? how is he these days ?
he seemed ok . we didn t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . we just at each other .
so how long do you think the holiday last ?
of course . what do you want to move first ?
let s move the sofa . can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? i ll lift this end . i want to move it sideways in that direction .
no not very much . he s too ambitious and dishonest .
i agree . i like his brother paul .
yes . they are completely different . paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother .
what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?
i think i m polite careful relaxed and shy .
oh i do n't think you 're shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party .
i think you 're right !
you 're right . i love going out and making new friends .
so you 'll be at my birthday party on friday ?
of course !
i wouldn t miss it for the world ! it s sure to be fun . she s invited a lot of people . do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ?
if everyone turned up it would be a squeeze but a few people said that they couldn t go so i think it should be ok ?
are you taking anything ?
i ve got her a birthday present and i ll take a bottle fo wine too .
that s a good idea . she told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . i think it s going to be a noisy party . i hope her neighbours don t mind too much .
that s what i was thinking too . i don t like it either .
it s a pity that she didn t want to live without a private room .
well don t be late . i ll see you on friday at helen s .
it was a pleasure . would you like to go with me to dinner ?
i expected that something might get broken . that doesn t bother me . that spilled drink won t leave a stain will it ?
i doubt it i 'll deal with it right away . luckily it wasn t a glass of red wine i ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth .
i m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag .
afterwards we can do the washing up together . everything will be finished within an hour . your friend keith is really funny . i liked his magic tricks .
yes he s very good . . isn t he ? he told some funny stories too .
what ? he s so funny .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
what did you put in that punch ? it tasted great but was quite strong .
that s my little secret . did you like the snacks that i prepared ?
very much . the birthday cake was delicious wasn t it ? emily told me that she and karen made it themselves .
yeah i guess you re right . what did you have in mind ?
all cleaned up . are you ready to start on the washing up ?
well first of all it s much bigger . it has the same number of rooms but each room is larger . we also have a larger garden which our dog loves of course !
so it s a threebedrooms detached house ?
yes . one bedroom is for my wife and i . there s another for our daughter . my wife wants to use the third one as a guest room but i d like to make it into a study . our daughter is also keen on making it a study so that s probably what will happen .
what s the kitchen like ? i know both you and your wife like to cook .
that s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . the kitchen and dining room are together . it s really large .
are the rooms nice and bright ?
yes they are . that s very important to us . we like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . each room has large windows .
do you have a balcony ?
no we don t . we wish we had one . that s the only thing we wanted but don t have . the area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly .
you re right on the edge of the city aren t you ? there can t be much noise or traffic there . is it easy to get into city centre ?
it s a very quiet neighbourhood . there s some traffic but not much . it s not very difficult to get to the city centre but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ll get lost . so when are you going to drop by ?
my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . they have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . the picture are of things they want . people sign their name by the item they will buy .
that s clever ! then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there s no chance of two people buying the same gift . what things were in the notebook ?
most of the things were household appliance . you know everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . i think it s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home .
so what did you get them ?
i bought a sewing machine . i know that my friend likes making her own clothes but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems .
that wo n't be a big mistake . those are kind of clothes . are they small ?
i got laid off today .
household appliance don t seem to last for a long time nowadays .
i think it s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . because they know that we will buy the new models the appliances don t need to last more than five or ten years at most .
not really . i like looking on the internet at what s available but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i m buying before i pay for it . sometimes i ll look at something in a shop but later buy it online if it s cheaper . you don t like buying things online do you ?
well you ll find someone who is familiar with the idea of what you need . sometimes you can find faulty products and prices .
not really . i know that it happens but if you buy from <unk> companies with secure websites you should be ok . even though i use online shopping facilities i don t think it s the best way to shop .
i m surprised to hear you say that . i thought you loved anything technological .
i do . i m a big fan of using new technology but i don t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . i think people need to get out and interact with other people .
so how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
sure . i d love to join you . can we stop by the computer store ? i just want to see if they have something .
sure . while you re in the computer store . i will visit the book store opposite . i like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting .
ok . i ve finished online . let s go . i ll just get some money and my credit card .
thanks for reminding me . i had forgotten to get mine .
ok . put on your casual clothes and pack some food and beverages .
i 'll see you at the party .
thank you . bye .
it 's a bit nervous but i 'm not sure what to do .

i am sure it will . it will be .
i think you ll find that one day .
i could n't agree with you more .

i do n't think so . it 's probably better to be a good thing .
it 's a fun job .
you 'd better take a hot shower right now or you will catch a cold .
in that case i m not living with a big tv station .

i want to book a tour with adventure sports .
excellent ! our company has more than ten years of experience in the adventure tourism and sports field . let me show you some options . this is our most popular choice our river guides will take you
i don t really think i m ready to throw myself down a river full of jagged rocks in a rubber boat or go up in a <unk> basket held up by an oversize balloon . what else do you have ?
are you interested in doing that ?
you mean that people look down to me ?
mmm . ok . well why don t you tell me a little bit more about what you would like ? we have everything from mountain biking to rock climbing to street .
i see . the rest of my life is a little too complicated for me .
i have the perfect option this package will take you on a hiking trip through the for three days and afterwards there s a dog sledding journey !
that s fantastic !
thank you .
thank you .
i 'm from china . what about you ?
what was the score ?
i don t have to be so anymore .
how much do you have to pay ?
business . i have a trade convention i 'm attending in chicago .
what a picnic !
i ll be here for the conference on monday .
well i 'd like to tell you that our company is very interested in hong kong and new york .
in that case i have to go to the hotel right now .
well i guess i 'm so hungry .
i see . thank you .
thank you .
no .
but our bank is not in .
no i do n't .
i see what you mean . that 's why it did n't you buy it .
i would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife .
very well we have a couple of different options such as beaches the wilderness the countryside or even going to a spa for the weekend .
i think something in the countryside would be nice .
perfect ! this package includes roundtrip flights to new hampshire . a free airport pick up is included . our vip limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger
sounds good ! what is the hotel that we will be staying at like ?
that is the best part . your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and to accommodate a maximum of that is guests . you will enjoy an and private time in this
sounds quite fruitful how many people live there ?
of course ! the hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail . you can also go fishing to the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard .
i m sold ! i want to book this trip . i don t care what it costs ! money is no object !
i am sorry sir . the flight is full now . please go over there and have a good rest .
thank you .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
the toilet doesn t run in the shower .
how long would you like to stay ?
thank you very much .
don t mention it . i m glad to help .
that s no problem . there are only a few places where we go .
i see . thank you very much .
we do n't have a swimming pool sir but we do have swim stations in the gym .
i like the punch . it s time i was thinking of going to get something to eat . i don t want to see you today .
well the check was declined .
really ? i m sorry to hear that . would you mind giving me a few minutes ?
no i got off the phone with me and we have it coming in for the second floor .
don t worry . there are many other options using the internet as dating methods . some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . of course for these sites you have to pay a membership fee . but all it is more serious and professional . the chance of meeting a good person who does not play games is higher .
oh yes . i was n't killed . but i already told him that i m going to be in a hurry .
congratulations !
yes . and what kind of room would you like ?
that sounds great . okay i ll go there .
well we 'll have to wait .
that 's a good idea . how long are you going to stay ?
it s about six or seven miles . that s about the kilometers .
then we drive west on the m25 . we must be careful to turn in the right direction !
then we turn left and walk up this small hill . the view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . we can eat a snack there .
then we will follow this path down the hill to the old church .
we can spend a few minutes looking around the church . then we turn right and walk along this path .
this path leads to the cave . can we look inside the cave ?
yes we can but it isn t very interesting .
then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path .
how far is that ?
would you like to have dinner with me ?
i think it will take about four hours including breaks .
that s fine . are there along the way in case we get lost ?
oh yes .
yes . i received the scholarship 3 times in most of the university .
great ! congratulations ! that s great .
so what s the problem ?
how ay years do you have ?
they asked me to do the things that i got to do in accordance with an international law .
yes he must have been passed out at the airport one hour .
i know but there are 2 reasons . first of all i 'm sure that the teacher will be taken .
i must get home to the airport and catch the embassy .
it 's the tradition . they are not allowed to develop trains . but there are also a lot of trees in the state .
hello i 'd like to speak to nancy .
ok what kind of room do you want ? we have single rooms twin rooms double rooms and suites available on friday .
a single room with a bath if possible .
you mean i have a vip room ?
john smith .
how long do i need to pay the fee ?
that 's good .
so did you have a good trip ?
ok . it 's for my birthday .
yes here you go .
will you be checking any bags today .
yes i d like to check three pieces .
i m sorry sir . airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage at twenty kilograms each plus one piece of carryon luggage . i will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase .
what ? why ! i am taking an intercontinental flight ! i m flying sixteen thousand cms ! how am i supposed to only take two twenty kilo bags ? that s absurd !
i am sorry sir there s nothing i can do . you cannot board the flight with that large bag either . carry on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat . that bag is clearly too big .
now i see . you charge next to nothing for an international ticket but when it comes to charging for any other small thing you charge an arm and a leg ! so tell me miss how much will i have to pay for all of this .
let s see . . . six hundred and twentyfive us dollars .
that s more than my roundtrip ticket !
do you have any idea how long it will take to get there ?
there is plenty of traffic .
yes it is . are you in a hurry sir ?
yes i 'm going to travel to london .
i do n't know what to say . do you have any plans for the first time ?
well . i would like to get a hamburger and a cup of coffee .
how long would you like to stay ?
i am used to being on my own .
why ? you need to pay so much for the rent .
how much do you want to spend ?
my wife .
and what s your <unk> ?
what s the price ?
don t be so sure . just give him a call if you need any help .
let me check sir . according to your file you watched titanic monday evening .
well the file is wrong . i was at a great concert that night .
i wish i had a chance to go .
you want me to take out some details out of your interest .
it 's my pleasure . how about you as long as you are ready ?
you ca n't do that ! you ca n't charge me for a mistake that you made !
it 's a camera .
of course . this is the service and your service is 2 . 00 dollars .
i would n't mind having to do that . i just do n't want to be able to get you for a little .
yes there is one of the most famous local food list .
one thousand yuan please .
that s good to hear . i guess you need to put this on the table then .
that sounds great . i 'd like to just get a home .
i have to see if i can fit you in on the day after tomorrow .
great idea ! could you please call them to see if she 's interested ?
yes sir .
what 's the problem ?
as much as possible . we are having a sale of the whole saturday .
then i guess you would like the job .
i would like to book a table for six for the next monday .
i love going to the mall . would you like to go there ?
that sounds like a good idea . could you please call them to see if we can get in tonight ?
yes of course . when would you like to go ?
what would you like to order ?
i have a menu from your restaurant . what do you recommend ?
i hate to tell you this but we have no more filet mignon . may i suggest the porterhouse instead ?
well i prefer filet but porterhouse is good too .
and the champagne are good too .
just the champagne will be fine thank you !
thank you for your experience .
that 's fine .
how much ?
actually you 're not feeling well just let me know . i have a deep breath for you .
well i see the cable . but my computer runs on wireless only .
that 's ok . but in my opinion it must be somewhere in shanghai .
maybe i could have a try .
first of all we 'll put you through .
great ! how much is it for a minute ?
well because i 've got to get my license .
what 's the charge for that ?
<unk> we do offer wireless in our lobby . you can bring your laptop down here .
great ! what if i need to print something in the lobby ?
unfortunately it 's not . you will have to pay to use it .
sure . what kind of potatoes would like ?
i do n't know . why do you think i 'm trying to quit ?
i hate to tell you this but we have no more filet mignon . may i suggest the porterhouse instead ?
i prefer the filet but porterhouse is good too .
i prefer the but i prefer filet mignon at porterhouse will do .
thank you but just the champagne will be fine .
i 'm looking for you to choose a double room .
that 's fine .
please call if you have any other requests . your food will be delivered promptly .
would you like another beer ?
well . and what about dvds ?
i hate to tell you this but we have no more filet mignon . may i suggest the porterhouse instead ?
i 'd prefer the filet but the porterhouse will do .
perhaps i could interest you in chocolatecovered strawberries with the champagne ?
thank you but just the champagne will be fine .
i do n't want to drink every night right now !
thank you very much .
well i think a crystal would look great in your living room and maybe some new drapes for the windows . also a grandfather clock would look great in the . perhaps you could buy some <unk> plants for the dining room
actually i 've a computer lab located on the first floor !
well my unfortunately there is n't . but my laptop is on my business card .
in that case i think a checking account may be more convenient than that .
yes i 'd love to hear what the alternatives are .
a good job ! please !
very good . how much is the cable ?
it 's 150 rib for the service .
that 's great . i will take it .
<unk> we do offer wireless in our lobby . you can bring your laptop down here .
great ! what if i need to print something in the lobby ?
you wo n't have to go to the computer lab .
how about this one ?
i 'm sure it 's broken .
here is your laundry . i am sorry to tell you that one of your clothes has shrunk due to our fault .
we paid for the room service already in our room .
we are very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience .
i am not sure but i know i know it 's hard to say .

acupuncture may cause just a little pain but it also causes a certain feeling of numbness and . we ll try it every day for seven days . will that be all right ?
i see . how long will it take to get the passport ?
i wish you could tell me more about your family .
do you think i can get back to work very soon ?
do n't be in such a hurry . i 'm confident that you 'll be completely recovered in 4 to 6 weeks .
is there anything i should do ?
you 'd better have a good rest for a week . be sure to have regular meals . stay away from alcohol . give up smoking at least a little while .
should i take some medicine ?
yes . i 'm going to give you some . take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . for that one two tablets . and remember to come to the out patient department for a consultation in two weeks please .
it 's very kind of you .
it 's not a big deal . hey i found them .
let me see . roll up your sleeve please . um . . . it 's swollen and red here . i 'm afraid we 'll need to take an xray to see if it 's broken .
what if it 's broken ?
then we 'll put you in a cast .
wonderful ! how much is the fare ?
exciting but i suppose the sunshine is a fantastic choice . i 've never had a chance to go in the park before .
when did you last time have your eyes checked ?

come over here . i will test your eyes . first cover your left eye like this and when i point please read the chart from the top and go as far as you can telling me which way the e points .
your mentality is very good . i 'm sure that you can find a good idea .

automatics are very simple to explain . the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
i want to work in the banking industry .
actually i think the company will provide you with information . do you think the office environment is better ?
of course not ! i have to learn a lot from your career .
i have a guest pass . you can go to the doctor and i 'll give you a call .
that 's easy . i 'll go get it for you .
that 's good . i think you 'd better take it back to the office .
i 'm finished .

i understand . i guess i can do it well .
would you agree that the prices are much too high ?
thanks . if you can go ahead and sign the agreement this afternoon i will go ahead .
yes our quality department is very good .
that 's too much for us really .
so you think i should be able to read the whole issue and make a through the issue ?
smile at all right . please sit down for a moment .
the secret is to protect and running .
i m worried about my neighbor but he is really upset .
well with perm we can do very kinds patterns such as bob chocolate hairstyle or bang . which do you prefer ?
you do n't have to pay for anything ?
sure that 's ok .
how long would it take to get my new apartment ?
right here . how is the deposit ?
the idea is to send the risk to the successful language .
i can hardly believe that . how 's it going to be able to entertain myself ?
it 's a traditional family .
do you think your parents would be like that ?
you can have one free trip .
well you should not let down your guard . some details should be smart but not too big .
oh i 'm sorry . he 's not a good player .
well she is too excited to see her .
i think it 's a good thing .
short and sweet . but they 're not so bad .
then he was hoping to show you to a few men . in your hand i was quite nervous .
congratulations !
as soon as possible . we are in bad need of the goods .
but i prefer the downtown . why not get it then ?
no sir .
it s going to be 25 .
no thanks anyway .
it 's comfortable but now we have to wait for the next one .
half past seven in the morning .
what 's that ?
yes . if you do n't mind sharing room with someone else there 's no use .
well i am thinking about the job you have taken .
what do you think i should do ?
i m a keyboard operator .
sounds good to me . i think an independent firm will give you a good chance of jobs . it s not easy to do . i can give you a good deal .
i 'd like to put it on the bottom of my visa .
alright i think the basic position is for you . how did you manage your time on a diet ?
she 's a lot of initiative . she thinks that we should make her own decision .
so you think that 's in the family ?
well i would say a lot of people who are interested in .
she 's at the supermarket . besides you can find it by email or ask her to keep her away from the hospital .
people who are honest about money bags and i think we need to buy some clothes for everyone .
do you have any experience in the job ?
oh yes . i remember tom was supposed to be my first day .
do you think you 'll like her to be your mother ?
well i m very good with people . i m very good at organizing systems .
goodbye !
they are responsibility skill patience quietness and so on .
what do you think about it ?
i think that there is a definite difference . you should make sure that your company is in <unk> your work style .
you should get a loan . it s a little appreciated .
i think the older generation tend to be a bit less important . but i do n't know what to do with my pc .
that is true . most of the time we eat and watch more tv .
overtime work is very common in companies . i can work overtime if it 's necessary but i don t think i could work overtime everyday .
so you do n't have any experience in a company ?
i 'm a student .
how would your coworkers evaluate you ?
i would n't call myself extroverted . sometimes i enjoy being by myself very much . but other times i like sharing activities with others too especially during these last few years .
ok . well let 's call it a day and see if you have a good time .
i think it 's a pity . i 'd better not try to find a job .
but it 's almost impossible to get to work out of the way you can stay .
well i m very good with people . i m honorable . i work hard . i work well under pressure . and i m patient .
do you mind if you hire me ?
i 'm afraid i have n't been able to meet myself in business . i 've always been busy .
oh it is my cell phone ringing . i set it in the vibration mode .
it is a good habit to set your cell phone to <unk> . it is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices .
you are right . some ring tone is just terribly loud . you can hear it even in the next door . it is really a kind of distraction .
maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done .
well . if you give me your attitude i 'll try it .
of course you can . i am sure this one works very well . i just sent dozens of pages . how many pages are you sending ? are you familiar with my fax machine ?
yes i think you have the same model as i have . does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
yes it will print immediately .
yes but they are all handmade . you know the fax machine is down .
ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
is there a charge for that .
check with somebody from the it department . they are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
we have thought of you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience .
maybe that is true . but i am a fast learner and i am willing to work overtime and i do not mind a lot of business travel .
no . but i think the government should send someone to help you .
maybe you could hire me on trial if i m not qualified for this position you can let me go .
that 's great !
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
hello welcome ! i want the details of your company .
why are you online ?
what is that ?
what ? you are so excellent . i think i will get the chance .
why didn t you answer my question ?
you 're right . the manager is a little bit nervous .
i 'm sorry to say i 've been accepted .
ok i 'll try my best to assist you in the future .
i will good luck .
yes speaking .
this is the front desk . i 'm afraid that the air conditioning in your room needs repair . we would like to request you to change your room . we are very sorry for the inconvenience .
i 'll try to make it to your next time .
well i will certainly give you the advice slip . i will call the instructions if you have any questions .
so you have to open all the envelopes .
yes except the personal mail . and i also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the email box regularly .
ok . there are several services you want to buy and what you want .
yes and i check all the emails for mr . thomas .
where is that ?
i 'll be here to pick you up at 630 .
we 're ready to get to the airport .
it 's my pleasure . well it 's a little tight .
yes i 'll be there on time . goodbye !
yes . are you ?
i have a headache . these past few days i 've been living off painkillers . man i feel like my head is going to explode .
it 's october the 1st our national day . i 'd like to talk some more but i 've got to get going now . it was nice talking to you though .
what specific places do you wish to visit ?
what seems to be the problem ?
at 8p m tomorrow night .
at 8 o 'clock .
my watch says ten to seven . what s the excuse for ?
you wo n't be late . it 's still early .
oh really ? what a pity . i was just looking forward to meeting you .
how could the news get any worse ?
oh no i 'm afraid i did n't .
i can only hear that .
i have a lot of work to do in a job . i got a project to choose .
would you like to have a try later ?
i know i want to work with a team in a team and i want to work with .

have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
i am sorry to hear that .
well goodbye and do n't forget to call me again .
i could n't go to work today .
certainly i will . what s the problem ?
you can email your application materials for application to the websites of job agencies in guangzhou .
for whom ?
you can get one from student services .
the popular holiday is coming from two people . we have a special apartment for you . a dog has just come and there s no room for the first .
where is that ?
i need to call a number on the outside you now . do you have a reservation ?
all you have to do is cook some white rice .
we should do this more often .
may i turn on the tv then ?
thanks . i will arrange someone to come back later .

that 's pretty high . how long have you been on the company ?
is that including tax ?

you know what kind of coffee do you like ?
absolutely . i was born in australia and still has a wonderful time in every year .
so what 's the maximum amount that you want to pay in the loan ?
to have this business concluded i should say a reduction of least 10 would help .
you may have known that we have competitors from south korea and other countries . at the beginning of our campaign there is sales resistance to overcome we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and tv programs . a 20 commission will not leave us much .
well i think the most important thing is to be friendly .
yes it is the best of our hotel .
the european market is not familiar with your products . you have competitors from japan and other continental countries . at the beginning of our campaign there is sales resistance to overcome we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news papers and tv programs . a 10 commission will not leave us much .

i 'll talk to you later .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
he 's a team player .
yes i know that . but i can write the letter you want .
you need to keep as informed as you are paying attention to the job of people .
i will think about it .
i think i m tough not only physically but mentally .
wow that sounds great .
that s everything .
well i love it . the room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . there are plants along the corridor . especially i got my own desk with computer and telephone . such a great place !
that s very good . i once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
what was so bad about it ?
small rooms small window a small desk shared by three people . i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
sounds bad ! lucky you ! you didn t take that job . i think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
totally agree . by the way the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . you can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
how do you want your egg cooked ?
could you tell me what your advertisement is in terms of skills ?
yes . this is tom speaking .

the company will have a total of three days for 5 months .
oh dear . it wo n't get there for new year 's day if i send it by surface mail . how much will it cost if i send it by air ?
which one interests you sir ?
what else can i get ?
it is just too much . don t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ?
not at all ! i like the design so much . the designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept .
wow i doubt that .
i ve thought about it a lot . i d like to be able to get a job that is more lively than your company .
really ? what did you do there ?
i had a pretty strict project with a project manager . i was told to find a job that i have before .

sure . let me take a look at your schedule . it 's my treat .

i do n't want to go to see a movie tonight .
i m going to the cinema .

ok i 'll tell him .
i 'd like to buy a shirt .
certainly sir . could you tell me the name and your pin number ?

yes if you have the number . let me check . . . yes that 's ok .
i 'm not sure . but i 'll get a table ready as fast as i can .
i 'll wait .
i see .
oh yes . i 'm meeting a client .
good . we have a full range of other options such as beaches the <unk> and professional skills .
i need an appointment .
that 's alright . maybe i can make it at the next stop .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
how about this posttrip ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
it 's really good . do you speak spanish ?
yes i am sorry . i missed the bus .
but there 's a bus every ten minutes and you are over 1 hour late .
well i missed several buses .
how on earth can you miss several buses ?
i ah . . . i got have late .
oh come on gordon it 's the afternoon now . why were you late really ?
well i . . . i lost my wallet and i . . .
i 'm sorry that 's bad luck .
yes i found it again .
when ?
june 3rd .
i am not convinced by your explanation .
this is brown speaking . i 'd like to speak to mr . tomas .
i 'm sorry mr . baker is not in . may i take a message ?
when do you expect him back ?
i 'm afraid not . he is away for the rest of the day . could you ask him to call me back later ?
oh i see . when is your father coming ?
i 'm afraid not he has gone out of this town on business . may i take a message ?
yes . please tell him i called and ask him to call me back as soon as he gets here .
would you like to make another appointment ?
no i 'm afraid not . i 'm busy .
i see . i 'll tell mr . tomas you 've called .
don t worry about that . tell me your email address .
would you care for a drink before you order ?
great !
so you 're just a moment ?
nothing . i have a problem with the data but i need to check the amount .
yes . you are welcome .
come on ! in the two weeks .
i think so . i 'm just trying to help .
i agree . you know something about that . i thought the ceo of the latest film was not a brilliant scientist . what major was the most important criteria to say about him ?
i have to say that we have trained <unk> to do quality analysis . as long as you can get a thorough knowledge and then make sure they are in this field .
thank you .
it 's my pleasure .
that sounds interesting . but i think i could fly to see my family to get to the station station when i get there .
how do you learn to be a millionaire ?
oh . i see .
by the way do you know the traffic jam ?
i have to figure out what is that i can do .
but the sales number is close to the predicted amount .
the test is fairly simple .
do you think we can change a new issue ?
if so we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks .
what i mean is that we 'll never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great .
i think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . how about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ?
what is the problem ?
your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept . when i suggested we meet each other half way i meant it literally .
do you mean to pay for the costs of these things ?
it 's not just that it 's a bit high .
you may choose from the fish and beef .
i 'll come down to that .
you certainly drive a high way and i 'll have to think about it .
certainly . mr . brown i 'll make the gift for you .
i am not sure . i want to tell you that i 'm going to quit my job .
i see .
what time will the flight put me there ?
great ! as long as you can guarantee us no reduction we will give you an discount .
oh that 's nice !
well if you order a large amount we 'll take part in the future .
sorry i never thought about this for me but i 'm not sure what to do .
and when will we have our party ?
please do .
well under which is the most important advantage to ?
here 's two and i can assure you that would be the best price for you .
i will take some xrays and see what we re looking for .
how about some zongzi ?
that 's good . do you have any other questions about packing ?
we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers .
sure . we need a few different styles of carpets . which one do you prefer ?
well i would like to tell you a few units about this type of meat . how many units would you need ?
i ll need to pay for the insurance .
that 's what i want . for exercising at the club .
that 's very kind of you .
he 's over sixty . he 's so nervous .
what did you do ?
he is the boss .
if your uncle had an alarm system then it s probably got worse and he doesn t have to get rid of it .
i m sure you ll get what i can do .
i 've always thought about it for some time . the fact that i have a lot of work to do .
what 's your counteroffer then ?
i appreciate your efforts .
well then i will send you our decision on the next table .
oh thank you . i am looking for a black pair .
that sounds like a very good one .
to tell you the truth our country is not wellequipped to meet each other .
i 'm afraid that 's too much for us .
so you 've been looking forward to this job ?
yes i have been thinking about it for quite a while . now i finally make up my mind to leave . i have given my resignation letter to our boss last friday .
ok did you find a new company ?
yes i will move on to xyz company .
that 's good . if you are leaving so would you care to join us ?
forget it . still a lot of days will come to take a visit to you .
i am very interested in doing it .
that s great .
a bit ? i 'm just waiting for my call .
well i am not sure . lets me check my agenda
ok .
here is your boarding pass .
it is ok with me . so i will be arriving at your office around two fifteen pm .
that 's pretty much .
what is the problem ?
there were charges on my debit card that i never made .
it is ok . you look really pale and red eyes . i suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest .
thank you very much . i am sure good rest will do indeed . i don t have this too often .
well it is hard to say . at least you need to come up with a good reason .
actually it is my mother s wedding . my parents divorced many years ago . now she is ready to establish a new family . it is a special occasion . i ve got to be there right ?
yes you should be there . go find the manager and ask . i think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . don t forget to fill in the leave application form . it will be signed by the manager for approval .
thank you so much .
great ! i love the factory ! but why do n't we finish the first thing ?
all right . please come to my office at 9 .
all right . thank you for that .
so what time are you planning to go to work ?
i want a job in which i can use english i would also like to be able to have some responsibility in my work .
what kind of job are you interested in ?
i 'd like to make a call to beijing china .
ha i am flattered . actually when it comes to negotiate you don t need to like it . you just need to understand how it works .
i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice .
i recommend you the white wine . it will wake up your appetite .
sounds easy . but how can i apply to practice ? i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . but i am afraid our boss will turn me down .
ok as john after kennedy put it let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate .
that is very encouraging news . i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . that is to say the r d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
it is not an easy job . how do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
that is the best one i have seen . i am sure our target customers young people will love it .
yes . i think the last company will be an experienced professor and your company will provide you with all of these information .
oh you are so efficient . i thought you might give it to me tomorrow . thanks .
you re welcome . you know these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . the more i think about it the more i hate myself for being so . i decided to change the situation as soon as possible . otherwise i will be more regretful later .
so how long has it been ?
the most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
sounds not bad ! better performance isn t just about doing a lot more . it is about focusing on the right things to do .
because it is too loud to be friendly and attractive .
i agree with you but i 'm sure you will enjoy it .
yes .
it 's really clear .
sometimes it 's good sometimes it 's bad . you have to like the furniture .
how do you know that ?
that is very kind of you . i hope i can learn everything quickly .
thank you for your consideration . when will you let me know your decision ?
i wanted to meet with you to discuss your daughter .
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i 'd like to postpone that decision until later .
i do n't know . i do n't want a straight home .
i think that is the best way to ask for .
sounds good . how are your scores in college ?
it 's the most important thing to me .
oh no you do n't have to .
i want to know about the fees .
our company offers a strict bonus for employees with training course .
do you have any other questions ?
according to your qualifications you are applying for a job in the field and during the period of period .
you ca n't be serious .
okay mr . sandals . your reservation is in our computer . all we need now is a phone number .
how much will that cost ?
yes . if you like the company pays off .
oh you 've come to the right place .
that 's the most important thing .
why not ?
do you want to take any money out ?
i 'd like to return it tomorrow .
you can return it within one day .
your flight takes off at 8
i can check with you right now .
i 'm not sure i 'll make it .
i need to take some souvenirs !
that 's good . i 'll see you tomorrow then .
sure . oh . it 's me .
do n't worry . i 'm a friend of mine .
i am sorry to hear that .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
what ? i m sorry mr . green .
sure . i 'd be glad to .
i see . most of my current employer just mentioned that the work in the us which is a company in the finance department .
what is the lowest price you may consider ?
well you re welcome !
it is said that i should pay more attention to your life style .
yes i m <unk> about your advertisement for a sales manager in today s newspaper . is this position still open ?
yes but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?
yes i have a lot of previous experiences in sales . i worked in sales departments for two companies since i finished my university .
that sounds fine . please give me your name and phone numbers . i ll set up an appointment for you . it will most likely be in a couple of days . is it all right for you ?
that s all right . thanks .
thank you .
your major must be computer .
do you think my educational background suits this position ?
yes i m quite satisfied with your qualifications .
does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ?
generally speaking training new members is usually necessary . we offer our new employees a oneweek training course .
could you tell something about the job ?
yes of course . you will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints .
oh i see . i believe i can do the job well .
ok . i should have it finished by friday afternoon . then i can check those account over the weekend . we need to have them finished by monday right ?
that s right . we ll finish them just in time .
from next week on we should be in less of a rush .
i m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . everyone deserves it .
who s the end of your visit ?
that s true . right . i m going back to the meeting . it s been going on for hours and there s no indication that it ll end soon .
carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is uptodate with their work .
good . i have to go right now . i really hope this meeting doesn t last too long .
they usually go on for ages .
i ll stop by if i have time later . make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines .
i will . enjoy your meeting !
not at all . go ahead .
well . you see i don t like the office . i don t like the staff . and i m afraid of you . and i don t want to go one . so may i put info a transfer ?
i 've always got the company to choose . i can make many changes in the company .
if you make mistakes in your job you 'll be fired . is that right ?
no . everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . the most important thing is to be responsible for your work .
working here involves a busy schedule and overtime . is that true ?
yes . that s true . we are always busy . the company attaches great importance to high efficiency . sometimes we have to work overtime but not always . and we have extra pay for extra work .
it seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as i expected . thank you for your help .
i see .
i see . i m sure the boss will be there . i think we ll win much in the next few minutes .
did you find any interesting editorials ?
that 's true . but it 's a good deal . this is n't an important point . we have a meeting tomorrow .
how much again ?
in that case let s get the check and see . the number is now worth by your passport .
what s the result of your information ?
i think that we should change some more . what s more we are able to get them .
it sounds like a really exciting city to live in .
well at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . this is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . in any case to take better advantage of the daylight available we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .
that 's right . and i would like to have a good time to start . what about the senior account for example ?
it sounds like you 'll have to be able to purchase your current account on the market .
yes but have you made an appointment ahead ?
yes my name is steven .
just a minute please . i ll make a call to the hr office .
so how long do you think it will take to get to the airport ?
it 's my pleasure .
you mean the network connection ?
yes i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . it took me almost one minute to open it . then there is no response for any click .
i have the same question . i can t send out mails . we d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately .
ok .
the did you also put that into a lot of energy ?
i did n't know that .
i did n't know you liked birdwatching .
let 's see . . . you are importing fifty containers of textiles from china . they should be able to place your order before the end of next week . it will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of ningpo . the freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in los angeles approximately a month from today . domestic shipping will arrive in los angeles . domestic
fine . we will handle domestic shipping but what about customs ? will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? i hope we do n't run into any problems with the border control .
no the chinese company has that all worked out . with the paperwork you receive with the shipment you should be good to go .
so what 's your meaning ?

i am just looking but i 'm not sure how much it is .
i see . please fill out this form and let me know if there is any mistake in it .
hello sir may i help you ?
well i bought this skirt here yesterday afternoon . but i got the wrong size . it s too small for my daughter . i wonder if i could refund it .
all right . just relax .
it is true sir . but i am not sure if it does n't happen again .
have you got it now ?
i know you did n't .
there was a camera ?
yes . that one for me .
certainly ! let 's just grab the tickets to the park .
yes i love the city .
hmm maybe i do .
yes . but i did n't know that . i thought it was .
oh yes .
it was a camera . the post was taken a picture of my remember ?
so you don t have to worry about that .
i think i 'll have to prove it was .
yes it looks like you have to buy a house and make sure there is a nice one but you 're not going to have to wait for a few days .
ok . that 's fine .
yes . if you 'd like to call the police station and give me your name card .
i understand .
yes that 's fine .
i really hope that your company could provide living places otherwise i have to rent a house to live .
i 'm afraid so .
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
oh look at the window . that s just what i ordered .
i have it but i think i did .
well i think it 's good for some reason .
no mine is n't .
ok . please try to fix it so that it does n't happen again .
you mean it was the other day ?
you 're right .
what did you do ?
you did n't have to tell me about it . i think he had a lie .
i m sorry . i didn t see it .
which channel is it ?
then he must have won a hard time .
then he came over to the phone .
what a pity !
i see . how did you get that ?
is there a charge for your credit card ?
when the lower branches are removed you ll be able to sit under the tree .
sure it s very simple . all the documents have in the envelope to carry are all the documents in the envelope . i think it s quite simple .
this is the kitchen . every thing 's new .
i do n't know . something rotten here ?
if you 're lucky you 'll get a discount .
yes . i have a house that should be clean .
it s a program about . it s very interesting .
well that 's all right .
they are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . muslims call this pilgrimage haj .
why do they go there ?
muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .
when muslims pray they face towards mecca .
that s right . unfortunately so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .
i heard about that . the pilgrims must walk around a large sacred black stone .
that s right . that s when accidents often happen . the saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims to reduce the chances of accidents .
pilgrimages are common in many .
yes . in england christian pilgrims might go to canterbury and many christians go to the <unk> on pilgrimages .
isn t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?
i think that place is <unk> . there are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .
do you think that there is something magical about that place ?
personally . i think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that them . i don t think place is magical in any way .
no it 's too bad . what 's the film like ?
that 's really convenient . do you have any other suggestions ?
it was a pity that they had to go to the wedding anniversary of march .
i was in such a need of issue . the problem is that that it could be found on the high side even though the economy has been reduced by three dollars .
that was a great idea . we had fun at home .
who is going to be ?
i 'll call him and tell him that you are in a hotel or if i have any questions or help later .
it does n't seem to me like a good idea .
i do n't know . it is n't an easy time .
i 'm doing really well .
good . heather will be back in about 20 minutes . i 'll tell her you called .
you can t be that negative .
i want to make sure that you get what i want to eat .
you can take a deep breath to pay the deposit and i guarantee the services will be much better .
no . please sit on the chair .
what ? you don t have the guts to tell you .
no way !
i saw her husband have it out with her yesterday .
yes . the rent is very important for you to pay for the rent .
and it s not so difficult to deal with .
i just need to know about this note .
that 's good to hear . but tell me what your decision is .
you need to turn your key in the ignition and start the car .
well i know . but i 'm not so sure about it . i know you are a foreigner and .
they should be happy to know that everything is possible to a willing heart .
that 's true . i 'll take it .
if you are free maybe you can go to the gym .
you will be fined .
how long will it take to get to collect money ?
i just think it s a letter from nyu .
you can read the book . the original story is much better and has a different twist at the end .
well it could be a long story to write you out if you want to graduated with a company that is more important than the job .
well i know . i 'll find it .
you can come in and renew the documents in 7 days .
i am looking for a sweater . i must take the figure out how to apply for a job .
well if your main job is asked me the exact thing i am afraid .
the government is not on top of that .
well they were all sitting in the neighborhood .
do you have a cell phone with me ?
yes but i ca n't do that . i know i ca n't find it .
sure . you can send it to any place .
oh yes i will .
no . you re supposed to call the office first . have a nice day !
i want to be in a formal interview .
yeah you will be the best .
of course not .
i bought a sweater from your store a week ago . it says that it is a bit too small for me .
thanks a lot .
no but i was busy with my parttime job because i 'm in a bit of a hurry .
what 's so important about the salary ?
yes i did . but it was easy .
i see . if you decide to go to more comfortable than they can handle it .
oh . i thought i already gave them a list of all .
that s true . if you want to buy a new one i can get for free .
are you taking anything for your job ?
well i will call you later .
did you bring your luggage back to the airport ?
how much will i be out of the office every week ?
i 'm afraid you have to do it .
is it easy to get the package ?
do you have your library card ?
how so ?
you bet .
of course mr . baker .
ask away .
you ve gone through all your money so quickly ? i thought you were welloff .
they pay me a lot of money . i got the money i needed .
does your present employer know you are looking for another job ?
well i guess i just got them from the u . s . dollars .
is there anything else you need to ask about ?
are you serious ?
true . the news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .
of course mr . lee could you tell me what the problem is ?
no problem .
thanks a lot .
no but i did n't pay attention to the responsibilities of the job . i like to do that .
oh . money is not necessary . we just have to take it back home .
well they 're still working in a new company . and they 're not very expensive .
that 's true .
can i do all the housework ?
if you make a decision did you ?
i am sorry . i will go back to your house .
i will be available on the fourth of next monday .
i don t think the best way to figure out what is to bring in under and fill out the forms .
the government is not on top of that .
yes i did . i have it sent to you .
well it 's ok . please send it to me by mail .
well i 'll try my best to persuade you to do that .
oh no . i have to tell you that .
so late . it s only 9 .
you don t want to get dressed up .
well i hope so . bye !

hello ! i was exhausted some studying so i decided to read the newspaper to relax . unfortunately the news is so depressing . there has been another murder in the city center . i m shocked that the police haven t caught the killer yet .
people are starting to get frightened by it . everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .
you mean if they catch the murderer . i m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .
there must have been some good news in the newspaper . i can t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .
well there was one good piece of news . you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?
yes . her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
