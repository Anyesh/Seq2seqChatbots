yes they give me a call and give the number of the person who comes to the office .
i hope they have a good menu .

well honestly speaking i went to watch it out of curiosity . i 'd say it 's really a special art form .
yes i thinks so . how much is it ?
yes . let me help you .
what 's the color of your suit ?
it 's 100 cotton .
that 's good . can you give me a reduction ?
yes . i have reserved a table for 2 at 730 . my name is bob .
i see . the straight dress is right here . but you 'd better put on it .
it 's nice . can i try it on ?
of course . let me help you .
how did the business trip go ?
no i have n't .
any particular brand ?
here are your keys . i 'll send them to you tomorrow .
it 's 100 cotton .
that is like a really interesting fact .
we can but i can t help it .
come on sit on . i will pull the ball .
yeah .
no . i 'm just putting on a little of him .
is he really cold ?
which number is he in ?
hi jack .
i bought one size up by mistake .
oh yes . there 's a large swimming pool in here .
is it quiet ?
yes they are . the aren t very heavy . there are many small shops and some small bills of course .
what do you think of the food there ?
you 're welcome .
does the mall have some other places ?
no sir . we used to have a few cars . but you had a fine time .
here you are .
the next bus will be here in four minutes .
ok . they will be ready in a few minutes .
you 're welcome .
i think a student pass is also a student .
what 's the matter with them ?
the ones that are predipped in sweet coating !
okay .
right . the problem is that i did n't think it was that great . what do you think ?
yes we should .
it 's just a slogan for a bunch of me .
yes your computer runs fast .
look at the positive side of your audience .
you 're welcome .
i 've never used this kind of style .
what kind of benefits do you have ?
thanks . i was n't sure what do you think ?
you said you were only going to window shop !
she only asked me about one hundred dollars .
but there 's no point in our company . it 's not the first time we have to change our mind .
yeah . she 's just a neat freak .
you 've got a point there . it 's a good opportunity to save . but he 's also a good mood to put things into the need .
yes thanks .
what are you talking about ? what are you doing ?
yes . last sunday i went to a nearby market . it was on <unk> fair . i chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot without even trying to strike a bargain . i paid one hundred and twenty . and just
is that so ? i 'm afraid they 're still not on sale . bargaining is going to be a worthwhile .
but do n't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?
of course that 's something really irritation . and the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . i recommend you to consult the price tags in the superb
i 'll have it for you .
i hope so .
you re right . we are having a hard time finding a home .
but you re in china .
i have no idea .
i go to bed at ten and get up at six .
that 's helpful for your health .
sure .
yes i am . i like to do a lot of things .
really ?
what about his hair ?
did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
yeah i 've got a meeting in a minute . do you want to go with me ?
ok .
i 'm sorry . he is not in at the moment .
sure . can you have her call me back on my cell phone number ?
ok . good luck .
80 yuan .
i want to buy two large kinds of watch .
yes we do . will you come with receipt ?
would you mind if i helped out in the kitchen instead ? i do enjoy cooking .
this is supposed to be your vacation we 'd like you to just relax .
cooking makes me feel relaxed . so what are we cooking ?
ok well we 're going to make a pan of lasagne a salad and some garlic bread . here 's the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?
sure . we should probably preheat the oven right away too .
that 's a good idea . you can also try to set the oven to make up the stairs .
that 's a bit high for lasagne . i 'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there .
fine . i 'll just get out the casserole dish the <unk> the salad bowl and the baking sheet .
you know i could do this myself . why do n't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ?
i do n't think it 's broken .
well if it 's not broken then you need to learn how to vacuum better because it does n't look like you 've vacuumed for ages !
fine . i 'll go vacuum . let me know if you need any other help .
yes . there 's a department store in the living room .
will you let me know where to get off ?
it s on the fifth avenue .
thank you very much !
i 'll pick you up at about 6 .
thank you very much !
it 's a fortyfive minute to an hour ride .
thank you .
you are welcome .
of course . is the dinner still on ?
yes i was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .
we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .
that 's what i thought you would do . listen i live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . it 's just down the street from all the bars . you probably do n't want to be walking around after dark .
it ca n't be that bad .
but it is ! take this morning for example . the subway was so packed this morning i got totally squished by about a hundred busy <unk> on the way to work .
really ? i never would have guessed . the criminals must only come out in the evenings because i 've never noticed anything strange when i 've been at your house in the daytime .
do you have a lot of time time in the evenings ?
ok we will . how do you get around in the evenings ?
when i first moved in i walked everywhere . but within a week i had my purse stolen just a block away from the police station ! now i always take public transportation .
has anything else happened to you ?
nothing else has happened to me but i have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close .
well we 'll be careful . thanks for letting me know .
yeah i know . but it is very difficult to get to know the exact time . maybe we could change it .
what are the cities ?
you 're right .
what are the traffic bad ?
any rain ?
yes . there s a rush hour journey .
but remind you there are some forbidden activities .
i have been together for a long time . my face will begin to be at work .
you know what ? i mean . . .
i got it . there is a big cavity and the monitor is over .
but the traffic is terrible on this .
he got hurt .
that 's terrible . they must be tough .
it s the same as meeting . you just need to get off at the airport and go to the name of the emergency room .
this is the only thing i 've ever done .
well the public schools are not very strict at all .
not at all .
hello madam . where to ?
do you have any rooms available ?
oh you 're going to have to be my masterpiece !
sure . how about this one ?
i see . thank you .
no problem . do n't worry the taxi is faster than the bus .
we will . let 's go .
you know i hate shopping more than anything else in this world .
i know . but we could get some exercise in and we could get some errands run too .
what kind of errands do we need to run ?
well we could go to the newsagent s to pick up the sunday paper go to the butcher s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner and to the chemist s to pick up your prescription from the doctor .
i 'll only go if we can stop at the <unk> to pick up something to drink for tonight .
good idea .
we must find some time to read report .
i promise . we re only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven t had time for .
the best way to reach is to go now is to sleep in a little while . i 've been going to the office every day . it 's i want to have a good rest .
at the zoo wow ! this zoo is really huge .
for what ?
i want to get a ticket for a concert tonight .
you said you were only going to window shop !
i agreed to not go into the mall but i can still look at things in the market !
i should have known . . .
it opens at 900 from april to october .
but i 'm going to be late . will you buy a new one ?
it 's already 3 8 o 'clock .
fill it up . super unleaded .
anything to drink ?

yes we have single rooms available then . you require two single rooms ?
to go please .
that 's good .
thank you . have a nice day .

thank you very much .
hello i was just wondering if you like a credit card with us we can hold a credit card .
i 'm sorry . he 's out at the moment . can i take a message ?

really it 's so beautiful .
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
you must n't pick it in this place .

it is at the north of forbidden city on the central axis of beijing .
yes ?
i bought one size up by mistake .
why not ?
i have to work this tuesday .
what 's the matter ?
it says no smoking .
sorry i 'm very near sighted .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do it again .
how about next week ?
oh okay .
it 's a hotel business .
i am not surprised you eat too much .
and i suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office does n't help .
no i would n't think so .
i do wish i could lose weight .
well why do n't you go on the diet ?
i 've tried diets before but they 've never worked .
perhaps you should excercise more . why do n't you go to an exercise class .
yes maybe i should .
that is just an excuse . you can always find some time to exercise .
but i work hard all the time for long hours . often i have no time for lunch . yet i am still getting fatter .
bill you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . and skipping meals will not help you lose weight . in fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals .
i know you 're right but what can i do ?
how about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ?
but i 'll miss the news . it 's important in my business to keep up with events in china .
i know i know . have you got a portable radio ? you can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time .
that 's a good idea !
just put my apron on .
not a chance .
the kitchen and bathroom plumbing are messed up .
well i do n't know .
those are the only things you want to drink ?
okay . i 'll bring it over .
it 's in the refrigerator .
how did the business trip go ?
well i swim and run every day .
now tell me what do you eat ?
well i do n't eat any meat but i do eat fish and eggs .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
oh yes and fruit i love fruit .
what do you drink ?
well i never drink alcohol coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
what do you drink ?
you too . have you lost some weight ?
yes i took off 4 kilos . i am glad you notice it .
not some crazy diet fat i hope .
no i just changed my eating habits . i eat a balance meal . and i eat less than before .
sounds interesting .
ah yes i 'm calling to thank you for your call .
yes . what can i do for you ?
this is kevin .
yes i see . thanks .
why not ?
no thanks . i 've had enough .
actually you have n't had much .
to tell you the truth i am on the diet .
that sounds ridiculous . why ?
well i am gaining weight these days and i have to watch my calories .
no do n't try to tend me . i 'm becoming chubby and i have to slender down .
you are not really chubby . you are actually thin enough .
i do n't think so . i know i 've put on weight this winter .
so you are watching your weight are n't you ?
yes to tell you the truth . i am on the diet .
where are you heading now ?
i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road . it is very close to your house .
is that the university next to the teachers college ?
that 's the one .
what happened ?
yeah . if we share the cab it 'll be cheaper . besides that your chinese is better than mine . the drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though i practice my pronunciation carefully .
well . don t worry about it i will be happy to share the taxi with you .
not very far from here . we 'll fly . it 's about one and a half hours .
are you in a hurry ?
i have to be there before <unk> .
you could try a hamburger too .

i 'll do my best .
here 's twenty dollars .
thank you . have a nice day .
no . if you ca n't break it keep the change . but can you give me a receipt ?
here is your receipt . thank you .
yes they all stop at this corner .
i want to go to broadway and 82nd street . can i take any bus that comes along ?
you can take any bus except the number 9 .
how often do the buses run ?
they run about every five minutes .
fine . how long does it take to get to 82nd street ?
about fifteen minutes . it 's not far . are you a stranger in new york ?
i m sure i can find my own solution .
how do you like new york city ?
i like it very much but it 's a little confusing to me .
you 'll soon get accustomed to it . it 's not difficult . well here 's the bus . fortunately it 's not full .
thank you for the information .
do n't mention it .
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .

yes . i caught a number 7 bus yesterday and they said i had taken a wrong bus .

what sort of <unk> are we dealing with ?
we just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything . we have termites in the wood cockroaches all over the place and last night i saw a huge rat out in the backyard !
well there s nothing we can t handle . i ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches but the termites will be harder to get rid of . we will have to cover the entire house and <unk> it . unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days .
no problem just get rid of the bugs !
morning michael . i ve been very busy lately . one of our other vendors is going out of business and i ve been searching for a suitable replacement .
well rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run please sit down . coffee ?
no . i 've had a hard time today .
haha i could never do that . i d be a zombie if i didn t have my morning coffee fix . let s get down to business then .
yes . i ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . the demand for phone cameras is growing and pear has been falling behind in the market .
that s great ! i m glad to hear that pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . is pear still interested in having those ?
no we re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . we were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
surely . let s get started by drafting a new contract .
of course we ve got a new room for a newly <unk> kitchen and we ve got a sample of wide selection of colors .
show me some classic high heels please .
ok right this way . what color did you have in mind ?
black . classic .
of course . we ve got this style here that is very popular . because it s an opentoe shoe you can wear it any time of the year . they look great on everyone .
umm . too shiny . and i wear pantyhose with my shoes so let s look for a <unk> shoe .
ok these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a twoinch heel so they are very comfortable .
i don t like the pointed toes . let me take a look at what else you have . too high . that one looks like the back would cut into my heel . i have a high instep so i doubt that one will fit properly . i don t want bows . those might as well be stilettos . ah finally this is what i m looking for .
let me take a look . . . it looks like you have a good partner .
medium please .
what is your date of birth ?
it 's comfortable . i like it very much .
have a nice day ma am .
why not ? come on ! just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
i will ! i ll feed it bathe it and walk it every day ! we can get a <unk> or a german <unk> !
what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus our apartment is too small for that <unk> of dog .
ok . how about we get a cat or a <unk> ?
we re planning on having children soon i don t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
fine ! let s get a bird then ! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! a parrot would be awesome !
i ll tell you what i can get you some hamsters and we ll take it from there .
<unk> !
well since we are getting up so late i decided to make a big breakfast !
nice ! brunch !
kind of so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
wow ! you really went all out ! did you make any coffee ?
yeah just the way you like it ! i also put out some cereal and <unk> if you feel like having something more light .
looks good ! i ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
get the jam and butter while you are in there ! oh ! and don t forget the syrup !
what ? you don t know the first thing about gardening !
on the contrary i have been reading a lot of books about the subject .
oh yeah ? tell me then smarty pants how will you go about setting up your garden ?
well first i need to buy some things such as fertilizer seeds and tools .
what type of tools ?
you know the basics . a rake shovel spade and a hoe .
right . well it seems like you have all your bases covered . what s next ?
i ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . i ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! gardening all done !
well good luck with your garden especially considering we are in the dry season and it won t rain for the next three months !
no thank you i am not interested .
please ma am if you could spare five minutes of your time i am sure we could find something that interests you !
i wish i could but i have to walk the dog and finish cooking so if you would excuse me .
we have a great variety of magazines all about cooking ! this one for example is a bi monthly publication with recipes from all over the world !
wow that would be kind of useful do you have any other cooking magazines ?
sure do ! this one is a quarterly publication but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas !
wow this is nice ! ok sign me up for both publications .
you mentioned you have a dog most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care pet shops and even pet sitters !
that is exactly what i needed ! what else do you have ?
well i also have . . .
no . i 'm watching tv .
i guess not . those guys are just as bad as the ones .
that 's a good idea . it s always good to have some coworkers that are harder to keep highly trained <unk> . i would never have to keep them on my own .
a company car sounds like an excellent job . i m very happy to have my own boss .
thanks ! let s go !
very well .
how are you finding your new boss ?
yes i 'd like to change some money to cover my expenses here . what 's today 's rate of us dollar against the rib yuan ?

did you work as a salesperson before mrs . vale ?
i 'm going to need some more information about this card .
there 's nothing else to do . you can ask frank .
my dress is rather narrow . i feel uncomfortable when i 'm at home .
what is the rent each month ?
i m afraid not .
yes i am going to look at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
the toilet flushes really slowly .
i will cancel that .
well if you agree to pay more money you could upgrade the carpet .
of course !
well the garbage disposal doesn t work we have rats and the toilet is backed up .
oh really ? did you find anything wrong ?
do you have enough money ?
well most of the time that 's a bit of a problem .
well thank you very much .
i ran it into a lot of problems .
what is the problem ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
i 'll take care of it .
i will prepare the insurance and make the wood .
it 's just the cows that are grazing over there . we can milk them later .
well the garbage disposal doesn t work we have rats and the toilet is backed up .
will you be getting another copy ?
all right . i m back to you office . may i take a credit card ?
i 'm ok . i wish i could say the same for my friend .
i need your library card .
i need to return a book .
of course not .
how about tomorrow afternoon at 230 ?

you should check the connections .
when will you be able to fix the order ?
oh really ?
how much is it ?
i m happy to hear you say that .
what can i do for you ?
the rent is 1500 per month .
that s way too much .
that s what i charge .
yes but if you stay in a few days you 'll get used to it .
could you give me a little more information about the home address ?
what can i do for you ?
what ll you be paying for ?
i 'll be at 300
okay mr . horn see you tomorrow at 1030 .
i think i asked you to clean it up earlier .
i had a home inspection before but didn t really understand it . it would be possible to get things done .
a home inspection system does not mean that it is .
it s been a pleasure talking to you .
the owners might not be aware of everything wrong with the house . some things are hidden but might still be a problem for you in the future .
i can predict it will have the largest circulation in one or two years .
the owners might not be aware of everything wrong with the house . some things are hidden but might still be a problem for you in the future .
yes the new product line is so high we call them .
i bought it in a store near my home inspection .
we could try to arrange it to help you . but if you would be seated there you get a table by one day . it 's an excellent meeting .
i will be coming back on the day after tomorrow .
if you want to wash clothes and you will get a sample .
the carpet needs to be cleaned and i want to paint the walls a different color .
let 's try this new carpet . you could use it for a new carpet .
i was also wondering if you could pick me up at home .
i think that would work out just fine . it will be a good thing for you .
that 's a good idea . thanks for your help .
we will need to talk about the day off .
yes . which one is the brake again ?
the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas .
i m glad this car is an automatic . i do n't like having to change gears .
automatics are very simple to drive . the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver s seat !
very funny . next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . can you see out of them ?
i can t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . could you move it forward a bit please ?
how s that ?
i m working here today .
check your petrol situation .
the tank is almost empty . i guess i ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up .
that s a good idea . put your keys in the ignition start it up put the car in reserve wait for the road to be clear and then back out of the <unk> .
i got it . don t worry . i ll get you there in one piece .
remember no honking this time . the horn is only for emergencies !
why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ?
i 'm not quitting yet . you know my favourite slogan do n't you ?
yeah i know . shop till you drop .
right !
and that 's it . you 're done .
ok .
i 'm afraid she 's out .
ahahah and i thought you were tired .
you know . . . i have a weakness for long dresses .
it sure looks special looks expensive too .
i 'll take this one .
do n't worry mary i 've got you covered .
that 's all right .
eyes you sent them to new york right ?
that 's right . i thought i 'd come back to buy a few more souvenirs .
what did you have in mind ?
well first i 'd like to buy a few postcards . my sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . i want to do that too .
we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . the same designs can be found on these posters .
posters are difficult to travel with . i think i 'll just buy the postcards . i heard that you might also have some of the <unk> that are made in venice .
yes we do . they 're on the wall behind you .
how much do they cost ?
the prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask . would you like me to get one down for you to look at ?
yes i think i 'd like the green mask in the middle .
here you go .
i 'm sorry sir this flight has been cancelled due to some mechanical problems .
are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift ?
yes it 's my girlfriend 's birthday today .
we 've got plenty to choose from here .
they look delicious . i think she 'll be pleased .
it 's a good idea .
you ca n't do that .
i do n't know what happened to me . i just lost it .
wow you really like the cooking !
wow ! you are really a good host .
i 'm still not sure about that .
do n't you think so ?
martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that sara was just a friend . now i have to explain to sara that i ca n't hang around her because of you .
so you have to buy new tiles and ornaments do you have a small cupboard for paris ?
wow what a great deal !
it 's my pleasure . have a nice trip .
we ate a lot of things . we played games and gave gifts to jessie . we had a lot of fun .
yes but do you have any exams ?
oh . i 'm not his fan .
yes i 'm just hungry .

yes . it 's a quarter to 12 .
yeah and it 's fun .

well i really like being with you .
do you know what time it starts ?
ok we can go to the cafeteria .
that was a good meal to make . i 'm glad you like it .
i 'll be with you in a second .
what 's so great about it ?
it 's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances .
not to me i would n't be caught dead in that .
i love that kind of stuff .
yeah you seem to like those styles .
i 'd like to buy some new perfume .
this one looks really expensive though .
i do n't care about that . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
lucky you ! i ca n't buy anything else . i 'm flat broke .
i got a replace my party outfit i trashed it last week .
why did you drag me into this ? i 've spent a week salary .
are you on the level ? you 're the one who called me remember ?
just joking t . i 've got some wonderful clothes . let 's go and have a close look at your outfit .
you can buy the bubble wrap here but you ll have to stand in line over here to post your package .
and the rich still wants to go to other countries .
it takes about 3 minutes .
can i buy stamps here ?
sure . how many would you like ?
i need 30 for my christmas cards .
do you have enough money ?
i 'll have them made up to the hotel at ten o 'clock in the evening .
do you have any going anywhere in the eu ? if you do those are less expensive .
no .
what about his hair ?
and the bubble wrap ?
that s another quid .
thanks a lot . you ve been very helpful .
i 'm looking for a job .
oh come on . would you like to try some chinese food ?
she usually does n't wear anything but a few drops of chanel no . 5 . but i 'd like to buy her a new fragrance .
ok here are some of our most popular perfumes .
which one would you recommend ?
well since it 's summer and it looks like you 've had quite a bit of sun i 'd recommend our summer special . it 's especially suited for individuals with sensitive skin .
that sounds great . i 'll take one bottle please .
would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
it 's ok . she normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder and i do n't know what shade to buy .
how about some lipstick ? every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick .
she does n't usually wear lipstick . she thinks it makes her nose look too big .
how about some mascara ? that will make her eyes look bigger .
no thank you . she has big enough eyes as it is .
i know what she would likesome whitening cream .
no thanks . western women usually try to make their skin darker not lighter .
will that be all then ?
that will be all . you 've been very helpful .
yeah i 'm glad that we did n't have to wait long . i 'm starving !
let 's take a look at the menu so we can order . do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?
what would you rather have samosas or poppadoms ?
i heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .
well let 's get a plate of those then .
sounds good . what are you going to have for your main course ?
i think i might have a dahl .
what 's in a dahl ?
it 's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .
that sounds nice . do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
ok . how about some lamb kebabs ?
that 's my favourite . do you want to have some wine or beer ?
i think i 'll have a beer .
ok shall i flag down the waitress ?
i would n't recommend it . i think we should wait until she comes round .
you 're right . that 's what i was thinking too .
what would you do without me ?
oh that 's my ideal coat . i 'll just be at the back to you .
i 'm sorry . i have no idea . let me check .
that might be a good idea . but i think that might be a little too expensive .
well that 's fine . i 'll just look at it . oh what 's that on your shirt ?
we have a blue dress in your mind . let me get you some shirts . we also need a suit to go with the new tie .
yeah most of the time . but i 'm afraid it 's difficult to fall asleep .
no . we 're not really looking for a black jacket .
i do n't think i should lie .
that 's true . but i am sure you will like it .
<unk> . i want a pair of pants .
well do n't you want to buy the old ones ?
i don t like the color .
it 's not the right one . but maybe we can try it again .
well indian cuisine actually doesn t serve beef . you see cows are a sacred animal a very important <unk> in the hindu religion so beef is not eaten .
i like seafood on my pizza .
how about rose ? it 's the most suitable one for lovers .
yeah but i m glad that you should also have a good rest .
do you have any ideas ?
i do n't know what to get .
what would you like for your main course ?
yeah but i m glad that you should also try a little salty soup and i m also going to be able to keep fit .

i think i 'll try the vegetarian .
no .
yes there 's any particular conditions that you would like to look into ?
anything else ?
no . i 'd like to get a full watch .
but i 'm not sure . i 've done this before .
not really .
i 've had a better time .
is n't that bad ? i 'm afraid i did n't know .
please .
i need to speak with you about your daughter .
you 're welcome .
yes i have been washing clothes here since a year .
why do n't you wash clothes at home ?

well it 's a 15 bus .
will it take me straight there ?
about two hours .

i 'm sure it 's still ahead of you .
thank you . that 's very kind of you .
i 'm afraid a bit of a train .
the problem is that you did n't do much better than the credit .
i enjoyed talking to you too .
you 'll need to make an appointment before the company starts .
i do n't understand why i need to make an appointment .
do you have any other questions ?
is it possible to take a couple of days ?
we can still meet at 11
i 'll be free from nine to eleven .
you 'll need to make an appointment .

how about 7 o 'clock ?
i 'll come to your office at ten thirty .
do you have a particular type of food that you would like to buy ?
i want one pound of ground beef .
it 's a piano solo . i 'm fond of piano you know .
which one would you recommend ?
the cream form is very popular .
why is del better ?
yes much better . watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . what was that ?
what 's that ?
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
that sounds like a good idea .
that 's right . you wo n't have that problem with del .
yes but i m washing clothes here .
when can i take the clothes ?
you know i have it right here .

but i 'm not sure . i know what else i should do .

i hope so .

well . i 've got a lot of cereal .
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the seed ?

he 's a bit nervous i guess . but he 's glad i could help .
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
but what if it breaks down ?
what about this one ?
no they 're not . but they 're on special offer today .

you mean i will have to work hard .
it 's hard to say . but i 'd like to go to the <unk> .
for the university of pennsylvania early in the morning .
do you have any <unk> in your family ?
nice to meet you ! i thought i should come and say hello to you . i have n't known anybody .
it s true . but americans usually don t all the time of us have to correct the same opinion .
geez ! now that all the people think about it !
have you any idea why you re trying to find a new one ?
well . i think a company is a place to get work done . certainly friendly open relationships among all company employees is important . but i think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a professional relationship with the boss .
i think the designers are saying that these languages are of higher quality .
yes .
i learned that he is also a legendary violinist .
it was founded in 2002 has been in business for 10 years .
oh i learned that he is also a legendary violinist .
well it s not all that serious . we just don t need to worry about them .
several years ago the countries and china singed memorandums of understanding pursuant to which the countries will improve their laws government intellectual property rights protection over the following two to three years .
well it was . perhaps it 's because of the dirty air .
really ? i 'll take it and i 'm leaving here tomorrow . is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you get it in ?
well they don t have a lot of hopes that the girls go on a business trip with their friends and have a good reputation .
i see . that 's excellent news ? let me just go about the details of your <unk> . i 'm from from from from happy travel to the other side of the city .
i want justice .
what about you ?
it was many years ago . you did n't get the scholarship from the university .
what did you do after you stay ?
absolutely . with the compliment i think it 's worth trying to keep the change .
i think the saudi arabian will hit the spot today .
the secret is to let s do a better team . now let s talk about some more details .
all right . let s play the game and see how it goes .
you know speaking in a typical chinese position .
that is true . doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application .
really ? i hope so .
he s fine . there s a lot of work on right now .
yes i liked it too . did you like the acting ?
i do n't mind . i like chinese food .
what is your favorite coffee ?
my favorite is to play computer games .
did you do anything on your mind ?
no i did n't .
i 'm thinking of dropping out .
i do n't know .
just a minute please . i 'll check for you .
he 's an excellent student . i have a good head in the country .
you 're right . he 's a good team player .
then i came back here . i worked for about three years to get some experience .
well you 're really serious . you have to follow me .
where does a broadcast company get most of their information ? i hope it 's not just from press releases .
well the cultural differences are the most popular kid in our city .
how much will it be for today ?
if you were in school you would n't have any complaints .
uh i 'm not sure . why not ? what 's going on ?
just relax . we 'll be seeing a movie or a movie .
we 're going to have to wait for the next bus to take us back .
me too . do you think they are gonna be ok ?
i hope so .
if so we do n't get up early can we meet at 5 o 'clock ?
ok . have you got the number ?
oh i 'm sorry i forgot . i forgot to bring it straight .
what kind of exam are you going to do ?
i 'm not sure . is it far from here ?
who is your favorite singer ?
you can have a lot of money then .
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
the special effects were not actually trained in . i think that many people in the country are causing the problems .
i think you made a good choice . but you should take an additional course in some english schools .
thank you .
well you seem to have picked up some kind of movie . there are several reasons for you to hold on .
just . i 've tried my best .
yes it is .
what are the favourite dances ?
that 's a good idea . you will be at home later .
nice to meet you lvan . my name is alike . i 'm from japan .
are you married ?
a second language is always difficult .
true but english is harder than most . it s a crazy language .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
one letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .
no wonder you say english is a crazy language .
it s ok . there s a new english teacher .
thanks . sorry to say that i was really looking forward to seeing you .
i was a student .
do you think you 'll be back at two o 'clock ?
to be honest i like all of them except for the math teacher . though he must be quite young he seems like an old person . he 's so boring .
i m sure he had better board the ball . i think though i m not a good man .
oh she s fine . she speaks very clearly and does n't use very complicated words so he s fine .
i think the languages are well enough for the language .
she 's in the hospital with my dad . i have to go back tonight .
where s she ?
she told me that she was a bit nervous .
she s no idea about that . it s a nasty habit . i think she s very good at making a fuss .
yes .
but we should n't have come back to our seats . it 's about time to get to the hotel .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
what are you talking about ? what are you doing ?
thank you .
i hear we ll have a new english teacher this semester .
no i think i could learn to help her .
what 's the matter ? she s always busy with her at the same time .
yes she 's an excellent teacher .
right .
she was a famous singer in the world .
you know what she 's going to do .
at first i did n't know anything about the machine . . .
you mean i should go to her later ?
no nothing .
i 'll try it . i 'm not sure . but you 'd better learn .
no . . . . she left me all the time .
in a few months i guess i 'm not so sure about the job . but i 'm not sure if i can do that .
sure . what about you ?
oh you think of me ! well i m glad they re healthy and safe !
no . but i think it s a bit strange for her . you know several children don t have a policy in the house . they just want a private vehicle from a home to a public school .
poor girl ! she 's a healthy thing .
i 'm a teacher .
a lot of young people have to learn a lot from their parents .
no but i 'm interested in detective stories .
that 's what i 'm going to do .
what kind of flowers do you like ?
you ca n't help learning when you 're using it all day . you 'll see . a few weeks study in the school will have a similar effect on you .
i hope so . you see at the moment i find it difficult to get used to the teacher 's speed and accent . i 'm awfully worried i ca n't reply as quickly as she seems to expect .
oh she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use english throughout the class . she does n't mind your making mistakes though .
you know speaking in class is a very good chance to put your english to practical use .
that 's the new teacher .
what do you think of the teacher ?
she 's very nice .
what does she teach ?
english of course .
is she your teacher ?
yes . she teaches our class three times a week .
can she speak chinese to her students ?
not very much .
it 's a good thing you can speak english !
yes i finished last friday .
you sound relieved .
well yes . i do n't mind admitting that i am . i enjoyed school but i did object to having to go in every day once we 've done all our exams .
well what are you going to do now ? have you made any plans ?
i 'm going to work .
just take your time .
oh yes .
five days a week too ?
actually five and a half . on saturday we have classes only in the morning .
gosh !
that 's too much for us really .
what do you mean by us ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
when do you start school ?
i 'm going to register right now .
that 's good .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
she 's very nice .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
there 's a lot to share when people go to the same places .
i know this kind of office is very good . and i 'm not familiar with the western courtesy and restaurant etiquette . i do n't know why i 'm a strong attention to it .
oh we only go to a private school for that one . some of them are the two or three days .
but why are n't the kids tired from using their school ?
well most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service but some of the education majors have had them made because they will be faculty members and they 'll need them f
very good . what is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
most of them live in the southern part of the united states . some of the private education majors have had their own home but they will not be used at all .
that 's the one .
there are several tiny countries in my country . my bank is a small interest but the daily rate is 2 .
there are hundreds and hundreds . english is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions .
can you give us an example ?
i 'll look up the rate . to look up does n't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . it means to search for and find some information .
what about the expression goodbye ? is that an idiom ?
that is just a natural grammatical english expression . it has a direct translation in other languages .
this is interesting ms . parker .
i m having a problem .
anything else ?
yes i have it .
thank you .
i forgot .
yes .
and this ?
you owe 24 . 50 .
i don t understand how much i owe ?
what s wrong with it ?
i ll pay it .
i need to use the internet .
may i do anything else for you ?
i have it right here .
do you have the receipt ?
i have no idea .
ok it 's a date then !
then what do i do ?
thank you .

you need to apply for one .
i d like to do that .
well if you like you can come in this afternoon . if you would like you can come over and have a look .
i d like to do that .
what time would you like to take the test ?
do you have an appointment with me ?
all that 's left is to cook it .
when will my passport be ready ?
about 20 to 30 minutes .
when will the library be done ?
do you know what room number it is ?
i have both but i usually use my car to get to school .
that 's great . but i need to be a little more independent .
i am not sure what a handicapped spot is .
well do you have any other choices ?
i park in the daytime .
be careful about the time limits on the streets . have you seen the signs for time limits ?
no i have n't seen the signs .
pay attention to what the signs tell you in terms of time limits and what days you can park there . do you know what the curb colors mean ?
yes . i want to make sure that the curb colors are far from the curb .
just remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means loading and unloading only . i think you 'll be good to go !
here you are .
now i 'm ready .
are you sure you 're finished ?
here 's my license and form .
thank you . please give me your receipt .
well go to the desk and put it in the box .
well it 's listed on the board on the left side of the screen . then you need to use the correct line .
that 's fine . thank you very much .
i want justice .
oh is that all ?
it may be worse than it seems . how 's it feel ?
it 's not serious .
my boss told me that i could leave a little overtime .
i 'd like to see going on a diet .
i am going to the airport to meet my friend at the airport .
what was your speed then ?
sure .
i might need some tools though . do you know where i can get some ?
is it easy to get to sleep or you 'll have to cancel your appointment ?
unfortunately not .
ok . well it 's time for you to move . do you know what you mean ?
i 'm sorry . i ca n't . what 's the difference between us ?
that 's a good suggestion .
no not at all .
but why ?
<unk> . i 'm going to put it on my list .
thank you .
is there a problem ?
what do you recommend ?
okay you can go to the bus station and check the book .
thank you .
that 's right .

what do you mean by us ?
i 'm not kidding .
i know a place that would work out well .
you 're welcome . and please call me if you need any help .
you 're welcome .

why is that ?
true .
oh you are my dear !
he 's late again . you 'd better not fall asleep ! he 's already coming !
ok i 'll call him .
it 's only seven minutes into the game .
and your parents are as clever as you ?
you need to get some rest .
oh really ? i like the story .

yes . i m pretty good at making curries now . i ve always wanted to make dishes of those detective stories .
i 'll take it .
well let 's get down to business . we need to start our math meeting this morning .
yes . but it 's not all what i asked for .
ok i will go back to work soon .
well i would do that . is there anything you want ?
yes i did .
what time are you going to leave ?
i do n't think it 's amazing .
i think it is the worst one i have ever seen .
oh i 'm not sure i agree with you . it was not a good one but it was not the worst one . actually it was n't too bad .
i ca n't think the same .
what 's more some scenes were good much fit for the children .
i could n't agree with you more .
yes ?
yeah . it 's been a long time since you had to look for work .
i m all set . thank you .
i 've got a backache .
how about a party ?
no not at all . you can get your goods back from the end of the week .
i guess so .
please ask her to call john .
yes . i hope you ll like it .

congratulations on your success .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
he is fine .
he s going to be sent to britain to study really ?
yes . he s already got the passport and visa .
fantastic ! please send him my congratulations .
thank you . he s very lucky indeed .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
it could n't be helped .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
it 's a very beautiful place in south .
yes you can .
maybe you 're right . but i think it 's just a good idea to move on .
that is true . it says that it is what is really like it .
yes . you know driving is very new york . it s a new car .
you 're lucky .
i 'm sick of it too .
the door bell does n't work the sink is leaking
it 's no use complaining . if we had got enough money we could n't put up with it and would have moved out .
sure .
how could i feel easy ? i m really pissed .
but you should avoid <unk> when you haven t got the real facts .
ok . i ll try my best to calm down first .
oh i am very sorry hans . thank you for waiting for me . you must have been here a long time already .
it s all right .
i ll get them for you at once . and could i file the report for you ?
i was in a comfortable place so really it s no problem . i am happy to see you . did the rain hold you up long ?
yes . when i came out of the subway it was raining cats and dogs . and i forgot my umbrella . so i had to wait for the rain to let up .
i totally understand .
she didn t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day s hard work .
poor girl !
not much except that my motherinlaw is driving me up the wall .
what 's the problem ?
i need help turning them on .
for example ?
we did n't pay attention to the environment cut down trees and polluted the air .
no i ca n't see that happening . i know you 're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
it 's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .
my motherinlaw used to do the same thing to us . if it was n't disciplining them enough then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them the schools we sent them too and everything else under the sun .
i 'm sorry to hear that . what 's the matter with her ?
she thinks it has about twentyfive or thirty thousand miles .
it 's pretty serious actually . she 's a meeting and is planning to go on his own . the meeting should be then again is not enough to be held for her call me again .
what 's the matter ?
yeah i was . . . you look great ! i can t help myself .
what do you mean ?
i d like to but i m not sure about it .
yeah . that 's fair .
can you give me a rough idea of it ?
well . that s my wife !
you re welcome .
who s the boy ?
yes . there s a rush hour ahead of you .
well i know . but sometimes i think i 'm a sad story .
i said bonjour !
yes .
really ?
sounds like fun ! but what if you told me ?
i think you re right .
i m sure you do miss that type of cooking . but can t you try to get used to western food ?
i have tried . but americans like butter bread sugar and cream too much .
i suppose you re right lee . maybe that s why so many westerners are overweight .
it s interesting that americans work very hard at their jobs do not take naps during the day and yet they can be so heavy .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too much fast food and that food is very fattening .
why don t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy being outside working during the day ?
what do you suggest ? i can t afford to quit my job until i get a new one .
maybe you have two choices . you could attend school during the day or you could get a position that provides training .
really it 's so beautiful .
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
you must n't pick it in this place .
where it is ?
it is at the north of forbidden city on the central axis of beijing .
i 've heard about that .
yes i 'd like to change some money to cover my expenses here . what 's today 's rate of us dollar against the rib yuan ?
you can get it back at the next counter .
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
it 's true . we usually do it .
i bought it yesterday afternoon and they delivered it this morning .
will that be the sixth of september .
yes . here is your receipt .
thank you . what s your occupation mr . smith ?
i agree . we could grow more in the way . if we were in a few months we would buy some winter .
what kinds of books do you like to read ?
i agree with you .
i 'd love to . but i 'm not sure .
get on . i m too tired !
why not ?
i ll do it for you . i ll get a lot of information .
alright . i 'll call security . you wo n't be able to use this stuff .
that would be great .
do you know how to turn it off ?
how long will it take ?
i do n't know . well my contract here is for one year and i do n't know what i should do after that . maybe going around for a while .
well have you ever thought about learning some chinese ?
actually i am learning that now . but it 's too hard for me . you know the four tones and the stuff . it really <unk> me out .
do n't worry . all things are difficult before they are easy .
you hit the nail right on the head .
well are you invested in some <unk> program ?
what is it ?
it 's a total ripoff of an american reality show but the imitation is unbearably clumsy .
awesome . i 've been giving this a lot of thought .
how about this sunday ?
ok cool .
and a white sports car .
no problem .
i might need some tools though . do you know where i can get some ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes ?
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
i am not in the mood .
why are you feeling depress ?
i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . it 's a real letdown .
i do n't think she would do such a thing .
but she did and it made me disappointed .
oh cheer up . a girlfriend is not everything .
but she means a lot to me .
then forgive her mistake .
oh i just ca n't forget it .
why do n't you say that ?
yep ! i 'm learning how to use them .
i do n't know .
you mean that a lot of people have the same opinion .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
yes i like . but i ca n't play it well .
what kind of music do you like best ?
oh sorry . it 's not your birthday .
why do n't you have any money for another bus ?
yes i ll try to do it tomorrow .
yes . where would you like to go ?
come on . let 's go and have a look .
yes you are right .
just in some way it 's not that easy to be away from a western banquet .
do you have any other names ?
so you 're a thief vicki .
is it ?
but i 'm afraid it 's a bit of a good plot .
how much are you acting then ?
it is a good idea .
yes quite right .
when you 're away i 'll give you a call .
how long have you been learning it ?
i miss it . i 'm always willing to help beginners .
yes it is . the food we bought is fine .
what 's wrong with it ?
no i 'd like a glass of iced tea .
do you want to send it by airmail or by surface mail ?
ok .
thank you .
i am sorry too . i know we 've been talking about this beach trip for a while . i should have told bob i was busy this weekend .
do n't be silly . you guys should spend as much time together as you can . besides we can go to the beach anytime .
thanks for understanding .
that 's what being friends is about is n't it ?
hey what if the three of us go to the beach together ? besides you and bob have n't seen each other for a while . i do n't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers .
nah i would n't worry about that . but i do n't want to be the third wheel . you two should have some quiet time to yourselves .
i know bob wo n't mind . you can bring a date like that guy from the bar you keep talking about .
maybe . . . i 'll think about it .
well last night i had a big argument with ann .
terrible . it must be something serious . you two are such close friends .
now that i look back at it it it it was n't that big a deal . i should n't have lost my temper .
really ? what happened ?
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
that 's pretty harsh .
i know but i was so upset . i mean come on ! does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ?
you know she probably feels just as bad .
well i think i was being a little selfish myself . i know they do n't get to see each other very often .
well in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding . you should n't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . after all you can go to the beach anytime you want .
yeah i 'll call later to patch things up .
that 's very kind of you to say so . let 's try some <unk> wines .
great . sweet wines are my favorite . they always make a great finish to a decisions meal .
do you prefer brandy or ports .
port please .
excellent choice . i love its smooth flavor .
the port is quite exquisite . it must have spent years aging in barrels . am i right ?
yes . you always have a good nose for wines .
next time we are about to dinner we should try some canadian ice wine .
oh what 's that ?
it 's a hotel but cheaper and offers free parking .
why not ? it sounds great .
ok here 's to your health .
thanks . cheers .
cheers .
i 'm not sure . is it far from here ?
i 'm going to meet my family at the real estate agent .
i 'm sorry . when was this breakin ?
yes .
mr . johnson ?
that 's a problem . i know him through the internet .
i said it 's a lovely day . why do n't we go for a walk ?
ok . it 's really a challenge to speak before a famous game for me .
yes .
so he 's a young man .
he did n't say anything but he said he was was was was was was too nervous .
what happened ?
he said there was a traffic jam but he 's not gone .
could you pick him out of a lineup ?
i hope so .
what s wrong ? that was a great goal .
yes but i bet 200 dollars on the cougars !
looks like you re going to lose out on this game then .
i can t believe it ! i thought the cougars were going to win for sure .
what were the odds ?
20 to 1 in favour of the cougars !
too bad .
what is it ? what happened ?
i think someone is stalking me .
no it ca n't be . really ? who ?
i do n't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking but staring . he just kept staring at me . he did n't stop .
what did you do ?
i helped build the sets and find props for the plays . what about you ?
did he leave when you left ?
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .
what did you do ?
that 's about five blocks . and around corners too . so he was definitely following you .
yes he was . i 'm not imagining it . finally just when i got home i turned around and looked at him . he was just standing there . he did n't smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious . what should i do ? i 'm so scared . can i call the police ?
actually i do n't think you can call the police . not yet at least . he has n't done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it . but if anything happens again then maybe you should call .
why ca n't i call the police now ? he was definitely following me !
of course you can call the police if you want . that 's not what i mean . i 'm just saying that they probably wo n't do anything .
i suppose . what can they do ? i do n't even know who he is .
listen carol . do n't let this bother you too much . probably it 's nothing . just keep your eyes open when you go out . if you see him a third time and if he follows you again then i think we should go to the police . but for now just try not to worry .
alright . and i wo n't go to that cafe for awhile .
more or less . there 's just one thing bothering me .
oh ? what 's that ?
it 's a hotel but cheaper and offers free parking .
what gift ?
it 's an egyptian carpet . the student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . seeing what gift was i was really uncomfortable . i mean it 's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . i do n't think i 've done anything to
so he had a blue drop ?
i know but i really ca n't accept such an expensive gift . i explained to him why but he seemed really upset about it . i think he might have taken it the wrong way .
perhaps . he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
that 's what i am worried about . i do understand the respect attached with the gift and i am honored . but i really do n't think it 's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . i think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .
not really .
can you tell me how to get to the jade buddha temple ?
i 've never been feeling this way .
i 'll go look at it .
it is . they have to open the door when they are left .
you 're right .
i 'd like to go to the dentist .
you 're in the right place . we are open from our center .
no they did n't . they are all vacuumed .
but there 's a mistake on the tv .
it 's hard to say . but i 'm afraid we 'll get up early tomorrow .
well i believe that she was n't very good at the university .
i was robbed .
it 's not a problem . there 's a problem with the credit card for the credit card to be hold it out of our ceo . he 's probably going to have a look at it . i 'll have to write down for you for another one month .
yes it is . think about it . if nobody paid any attention to anything then what 's it all for anyway ?
well there 's nothing to do about it . we are n't going to be able to help you at the moment .
then you might want to order a soup .
i 've no idea . i 'll get it for you .
it 's got a crush on you .
never mind . we 'll just have to wait for the next bus .
i 'm a fashion designer . next month i have a fashion show . i d love it if come . i can get you a couple of tickets . so you can bring a friend if you like .
i said bonjour !
no . we ca n't . i 'm really sorry .
it was the most interesting evening . we went all the way to paris . it was the most exciting city ever .
i really wanted to go .
we can work something out .
yes it is true . but it was on the top of the direction .
i sure did . i thought people had no luck .
i agree . we do n't live in the city .
my birthday comes next month . i want to hold a birthday party too .
that s great . we can go to the park right after dinner .
then i came back here . i worked for about three years to get some experience .
not bad . i just got back from the suburbs .
yes . i am very sorry i can t make it .
yes .
i 'm going to try to return to america but i will be there on business .
what is it ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
what kind of room do you have in mind ?
i 'll have to sleep on it .
ok . i 'll try my best to find a place to live in .
how much do are you looking to spend ?
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
hmm . . . well we have got a lot of kids .
would you like anything else ?
all right . goodbye dave .
hello steven .
no i do n't think we have .
i know i 'm sorry .
do you really think so ?
yeah . i know .
yes .
that 's the cutest little doll i 've ever seen in my life !
well i would say that i m just drifting here in the pool .
why ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
have you thought about graduate school ?
no .
what about his hair ?
you got me .
now listen ben . look i think it s a very good thing that a young man after he s done some very good work should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself and lie around and drink beer and so on . but after a few weeks i believe that person would want to take some stock in
what 's the problem ?
i 'm throwing a party on friday .
then why do n't you try the most ?
oh i 'm afraid i ca n't .
fine thanks . how are you doing this morning ?
that 's right . i just got back from spain actually .
weren t you frightened ?
well i ve got some papers due .
really ? so what s the news ?
not too good yet . better than i was though .
what are you hiding behind your back ? let me see .
he 's in the hospital with a bunch of flowers .
what should he do ?
yes his english is a good thing .
it 's only seven minutes into the game too early to be at home .
it 's thursday i think .
was anyone else there ?
the police officer that pulled you over is a hundred and i 'm not sure .
what do you think of it ?
i 'm going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
italian . they are the most popular kid i 've ever watched .
is it the rush hour ?
well yes . i 've seen them so i never seen a better one or two people .
well it 's interesting that i like it but i am not sure of the city .
really ? how did you like it ?
look at the crystal clear fridge . you can see so many kinds of seafood in it .
sure . it 's one of the biggest classical music events . have you ever been to the live show ?
not really . i went to a movie with my friends when i was a child .
i 've seen the 8 00 film for several minutes .
that 's for sure . you know i had the greatest time ever .
is there anything less expensive ?
yeah that 's the one .
now he s in love with rose .
i know . i think it 's going to be a great opportunity for advancement .
that is a good idea .
yes i am . what 's wrong ?
of course not .
i was denied a visa ?
that 's terrible . i 'm sorry .
what about the chicken ?
that s the warehouse . we can see it .
a couple of times .
really ?
it 's a special kind of chinese herb . it 's good for you .
well those small countries are of fun .
yes it is .
how do you like the game ?
do you want to go with your skirt ?
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
no i do n't .
after a while crocodile .
i 'm going to need to see your id and id card .
well we have espresso cappuccino latte skinny latte or americano .
now i can see what you mean .
i do n't know what to do with it .
yes please .
ok . but i prefer to read the book .
well it 's made of a platinum card and the lustre will never fade out .
can i also look at the menu ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
you 're going to come to the right place .
you know a good product is much better and cheap .
that 's right . we 'll give you a music player and you can do the history .
i see what you mean . and you do n't often listen to music .
i know but you have to pay a fine .
that 's right . i 'm a good singer but i do n't know how to use it .
well . cantonese food is rather light beijing food is heavy and sichuan food is usually hot and spicy .
i want to order a large birthday cake several kinds of cold dishes pastries and fruits .
no don t bother . it s a very good one . you need to learn how to use it .
and i can download it .
i like to paint .
i just like to sleep like a lazy cat .
i do n't know . they 'll just have a good rest .
i know what you mean .
what about you ? do you mean there are football games on television ?
what was the reason ?
i am used to editing with word 2003 and there are many pictures in the book .
it is such a nice place .
sure what would you like to discuss ?
bye .
that 's incredible . i bet she wo n't do any more .
well it 's true but what were you doing now ?
what s the weather like in your country ?
yes it 's all set .
no i 'm not a big fan of tv . you know i had to watch it in the states .
and how many english
yes . the final temperature was very good . we had a lot of fun there .
mmm how much is it ?
i 'm not sure . maybe it 's broken .
thank you mr . cooper . it 's to have the final say .
are these seats okay ?
well you 'd better take it up with your friends and do n't ever have a rest .
that 's a good idea .
he 's going to be fine .
i have his visa .
he 's an excellent antique very serious .
i see . but i m going to watch a movie . i don t know what to do .
i was hoping that you would come to my office . it is on me to talk with you .
oh really ? it is amazing .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
i 've got a backache .
that s great ! do you have a pen in a word ?
it bears a great many of advantages but also some weak points .
is it ? i 've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
for instance the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .
that 's true . some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
actually it 's not the fault of the mobile phone . but people should have a proper attitude towards it . mobile phone is a tool serving people not the fetters restricting them .
how much money are you making a month ?
i 'm afraid not . i 'm too worried about my mother .
they 're really going to get close to the door .
i know i am going to do that . it 's my first time to leave .
are you sure ? how about tomorrow morning ?
how about this one ?
no problem .
yeah . water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues .
but what are the sources of water pollution ?
they could generally be divided into two categories direct and indirect contaminant sources .
do you have to provide extra information ?
yeah . they are emitted directly into urban water supplies .
but what about the indirect ones ?
indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater .
i see . for the sake of us all we should be an active participator in the prevention of it .
sure . it 's an issue asking for everyone 's participation .
why ?
you 're right . i 'll make it up to you somehow .
politics can be an expensive hobby .
nothing really .
what did you think about this ?
i was robbed .
which is better ?
it has become a senior account at this company .
do you have any complaints ?
sometimes the narrowminded people make me frustrated .
well i guess i will have to read the local paper .
yes it 's not bad . i will probably take the bus .
i want a different hair style .
it 's not just about the things that you like .
yes you are right .
but i have to finish my work .
it is a quarter to twelve . you should go to the square so it 's a little late . i 'm sorry i could n't make it .
i m not sure but i will arrange for you and inform you as well .
i like traveling .
when did you say ?
we can really use a deal with you .
bye .
i 'm not sure . i think i 'm going to quit my job . i know i 'm going to take the bus but i 'm going to take the bus .
it 's true . if your sister lives in the city there must be a lot of people here to go .
oh ok . it 's open .
i 've been thinking about it for a while now . let 's go buy some tickets first .
i 'll have to write you a ticket and <unk> your vehicle .
oh i see . i have to go to the restroom so i can go back to the end of the month .
good afternoon ! sit down please . how are you ?
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
lin is a common chinese last name .
oh thank you !
no i 'm not . i hope it is .
i 'll be with the export manager of our company .
ok . i 'll call you if we have a question .
it was a new film transformer .
i did n't like it .
how did you like the movie ?
i thought it was pretty good .
yeah i agree . it was n't as good as it was .
it 's beginning to spot .
on the contrary i 've decided that he 's my mom 's boyfriend .

we have thought of you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience .
it s true . we ll start now .
what 's the weather like in winter ?
i 'm afraid it 's too cold for winter .
what will you up to this weekend ?
seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? that 's a good idea . let 's go !
we could share a room ! it 's not as easy as i think .
the snow is so beautiful .
i 've got it . i like the sound of stepping on the snow very much .
no . . . .
ok . i ll pick you up around 6
how big was it ?
no problem . he was offside by a mile !
okay . i knew i 'd buy you a new set .
for example ?
yes . i 'm looking forward to it .
what do you mean the kids ? are you probably going to get lost ?
no he 's too tall to wear a tie .
what did you do ?
my friends in the states were very beautiful .
i agree . the city is good for kids to get away from the city centre but i think it 's not too late .
that s a good idea . they must be very careful with their retirement .
could you have a look at your battery ?
that 's not the same thing . remember my trip to china ?
neither . the game ended in two all .
but i still think ac milan's defence seems better organized .
but the brazilian is tougher .
what does he look like ?
he 's over sixty .
yes you are right .
i think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons .
i see . too hot water and warm water can be good for you . i am sure the weather is good for you but i 'm afraid the weather is not too hot .
do you have a lot of tired ?
oh yes . i guess the sunshine is too small . there are a lot of historical exhibits there . i think the place is a good one but there is also something interesting .
very good . sometimes we use cardboard boxes for outer packing so long as we turn them off .
got it . can you see that few kinds of tours ?
yes i do .
what do you think sometimes people like that ?
sports .
all right . and can i have a look at it ?
you 're right .
i like taking photos .
do you ?
yes i like it very much .
i 'll bet you had a wonderful time this weekend .
that sounds good .
not much . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .
oh that 's exciting . what 's this guy like ? is he hot ?
well he 's thin and tall .
it seems you two are a good match . what qualities do you look for in a friend ?
there 's nothing definite i think . i do n't have a list or anything but when i first meet somebody i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have a radar helping me spot new friends .
well that 's something i 've never heard of . but if you as me what i value most in a friend i would have to say honesty .
i agree . you ca n't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .
yeah i know . a friend in need is a friend indeed . i do n't need fairweather friends either .
i like doing aerobics in my spare time . it 's good for my health .
but each children has his own interest .
it 's hard to say but i do love the foxtrot . the music has stopped
how about samba ?
yes . playing chess is a very aggressive experience . all the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . whenever i start a chess game i ca n't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all <unk> stand ready to kill .
do you have any hobbies ?
no . i do n't like it at all . you can do it in a couple of days .
it 's hard to say i love traveling . i love it . you know i 'm a good student .

he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart and he has a great sense of humor .
oh it 's love at first sight . when will you see each other again ?
he did n't say but he said he would call me .
maybe he is busy with his work . just wait and try not to think about it too much !
oh steve . stop it ! i am a bit nervous ! what if he does n't call ?
well the only thing you should call the boss and tell him you 're not going to be late . you 'd better not get him some medicine . it 's just too much better if you want . but if you 're not or not . and you can just take it easy .
thank you steve . you 're always so encouraging .
that 's what friends are for .
thank you . it 's very nice of you .
by the way do you have any house specials today ?
it 's clive of course .
you are a child .
i 've heard that when this happens it 's important to save energy .
you 're right . she is a nice girl .
what s the big deal ?
yes .
i think a regular visitor 's visa should suffice . with this visa you can stay in the united states for up to 90 days .

at school . and i 'm still learning it now .
how long have you been there ?
yes but i would n't like to get it .

okay .
well i hate living here .

okay . well let 's go to the movies and have a look at the menu .
that 's pretty normal .
how about a snack after work ?
why do n't we go there and have a look at the menu ?
yes .
i hope so .
yeah . he is driving me crazy .
he 's got a promotion .
i do n't believe it . he must have been arrested by the whole hospital for drinking plenty of time .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
what happened ? did you have a fight ?
no . he was n't . he was sick .
i 'm sorry . i do n't think that it 's a good choice for you .
but i think they are not as bad as the city .

that sounds like a good job .
i think someone is stalking me .
tell me about your family .
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind .
do n't worry about it just a little more .
what 's the matter ?
that 's a good idea . did you ask him to call home ?
i helped build the sets and find props for the plays . what about you ?
thanks . now you can help me with it .
i 'm going to buy some vegetable and you cook .
what 's your problem ?
i like collecting antiques .

it looks like it he s getting up .
i guess he hit him too hard the <unk> just called a penalty on the home team .
the giants ?
yeah .
why do n't you speak english ?
it 's nice to finally meet you .
well it was in the balkans during the war . he was only held for three days and then they simply released him . it was a case of mistaken identity and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . it was lucky they did n't kill him .
yeah i just got them . i started playing ice hockey in a community league . so i finally got myself new skates .

i 'm so bored . i do n't know what i 'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning .
me too . do you think we are boring people ?
i do n't think we are boring . it 's just that we do n't have any hobbies .
that 's right . what do you think we should do as a hobby ?
that all depends on what you like to do . for example i like to doodle on the notepad so i 'm thinking about doing some real drawings .
i like to play the piano for fun .

it 's surprising that some of the people have been sold out of the same thing .
well dear . madam if they don t think it s a lot of fun i think i would lose weight .
i guess so . but i 'm afraid it would be difficult to get to the wedding .
she ll be very beautiful .
wow . you 're going to live in the city .

i am glad you like it .
i can pick you up at the gate of your company .
good idea .
i 'll pick you up at your hotel at eight in the morning .
ok .
thank you . i think i 'll take the trip .
not at all .
i will . goodbye .
i have been working here for a long time .
i 'd be willing to try this hotel again if you can promise me no more cockroaches .
i 'm going to miss you too .
can you tell me when it 's on ?
goodbye .
sure . have you got anywhere in mind ?
i 'm starving so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .
that italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . do you want to go there ?
i 'm not really in the mood for italian actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy .
if you want spicy food then i 'd recommend going to a thai indian or chinese restaurant . how about that chinese buffet on <unk> road ?
i really like that restaurant you get a lot for your money there . but they 've westernized their food so it 's not actually that spicy .
you 're right . most of their dishes have sweet sauces . we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us .
the taj ? they 're a bit expensive but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
the taj it is then .
shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
they 'll still charge us a corkage fee .
that 's right . it 'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .
do n't worry about money . i 'll treat you tonight .
are you sure ? we could go dutch .
no i 'll pay . it 's my turn anyway . you paid last time .
i wo n't argue with that ! let 's go !
have fun .

what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .

judge from his look he 's a very serious person .

do n't believe him . he 's a liar .
we cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .

by the way could you tell me when the film will begin ?
it will begin at five thirty .
what time is it now ?

i do n't want to miss it today .
it was the most interesting evening . we went all the way to paris . it was the most exciting city ever .
what did you say ?
we can work something out .
yes it is true . but it must be top of the direction .
certainly they did . but i don t like them very much .
i hear the great wall closes early in the afternoon . do you think i can make it before closing ?
i washed my car instead .
i like spring too . we can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air .
yes . i am very sorry i can t make it .
me too . recently i 've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them .
well . you take care of yourself .
i 'm afraid not .
sorry i m not in the mood .

of course . they are the top one i guess .
when did you start worrying about your weight ?
crazy !
thank you . i 'll take one .
do you mean i should learn a lot from their difficulties ?
how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look ? i remember there is one in the gym .
that 's a good idea . i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
what did you have in mind ?
i have n't decided yet .
i agree . they 're very lovely especially huan huan .
what about this picture ?
the five dolls are sold together as a set and they 're priced according to the size . the bigger they are the more expensive .
oh i see . if i buy more than a set can i get any discount ?
i do n't think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now .
any other ideas ?
there are lots of things such as postcards key chains posters and various arts and crafts .
it all sounds great . we can go there after the match . i ca n't wait to see what they have .
i m taking a lot of cash .
ok here is your ticket and change .
yes . but i went shopping in the cities .
i went to paris . it was a great time .
air mail or surface mail ?

they are approximately nine hundred and thirtyfive thousand dollars .
well i 'm not really interested in watching horror films .
i know but that 's true .

i had a bad dream . i was walking alone in the graveyard and suddenly all the ghosts jumped out of their graves . they began to chase me through the graveyard and shouted that they wanted my blood .
you look so upset . maybe you should try it sometime .
i have . but i m sorry .

i know . but if i m sick and tired i won t have time to get up yet .
joe ? i do n't know what you mean .
i remember you are in love .
oh i took a shine to him when we met for the first time . but it comes and goes .
it 's greek to me .
so the reform can not be carried out well .
the government is making efforts to change situation .
easier said than done .
he is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
what ? it s only 9 p . m . now . why today he went to bed so early ?
he ran four miles and came back dead beat .
oh i see .
i 'm tired of your cutanddried opinions . who do you think you are !
how dare you speak to me like this .
why not ?
i 'm sorry .
it is n't your fault . no one will blame you .
you are so thoughtful .
i feel the same way .
it must be dreadful to grow old .
yeah . he has no one to count on .
have n't you heard that he is in prison ?
what ? beg your pardon .
john is in prison now . he was copped outstealing .
i just can n't believe my ears !
i ca n't deny that . she is so beautiful that i fell in love with her at the first sight . i wish i knew more about her .
but i heard that she had a threeyearold girl .
i can not belive that . it must be cooked up by someone .
of course i wo n't chill out . opportunity knocks only once .
you should strike while the iron is hot .
you 're right . i will have a talk to her about that .
really ? i thought he loved his wife very much .
yeah . but his relation with sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife .
he deserved it .
sorry i can t .
tomorrow night then ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .

just a minute . i 'll make sure to get it for you .
yes . i ve been a few people in america .
well you know the english is n't very popular . it 's a traditional american restaurant .
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
i 'm glad to hear that .
yeah it no one else has made it .
it 's unfair .
definitely .
what do you mean ?
i wish it was n't but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .
yes . it 's not only a surprise her but her father did not give him too much trouble .
it 's not just a good thing . it 's too good to make up of such a friends .

you do ?
love me love my dog .
how awful !
it s a sad story . it s just a question .
maybe i should invite my family to enjoy them but i am not sure whether they will like me . it is i really want to be a good friend .

what about a cold ?
alright . i 'm gonna go try to the store . here we go .
i feel the same way .
i know what you mean . when was the food ?
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
what about some mascara ? that 's a good brand .
why ?
i m not good at it . i just hope i can recover from the failure .
wow ! that s great ! i know a lot about the kids . where is your parents ?

a guy who 'd buy a gift for that girlfriend .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i see . but this is maybe they will help us understand what you 're paying for .
yes .
look on the heels . they are all your heart .
oh well you don t want to be ripped like you .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and and and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people were good friends . for me a room to be considerate of the quiet time . i was <unk> .
i want a different hair style .

mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
i found it very disappointing .

hello jack . it 's mary . what are you doing in your office ?
i ve got a fever .
where do you work ?
tomorrow ? no i 'm afraid i would n't be able to . i 'm going out of the town on business .
well there is a problem with the exchange rate . it s the same size that you have in the u . s .

i went to yale university .
did you ? and what did you study ?
i have a b . a . in economics .
would you mind telling me how old you are ?
i 'm twentyseven .
and could you tell me what other jobs you have had ?
yes i have worked in a bank for the last five years .
and what was your salary at the bank ?
i got 500 a week .
thank you . good evening mr . dean .
would you tell us your name please ?
i 'm rose teller . i think i 've seen you somewhere before ?
glad to meet you ms . baker .
glad to meet you too .
where are you from ms . baker ?
i 'm from new zealand .
what do you do for a living ?
i m a doctor .
thank you for coming ms . baker .
what s the news ?
may i know what you do ?
i 'd like to .
that 's right once a week .
we have a flight that we 'll put you there at ten am . is that ok ?
my birthday ? i hope we don t have time to come to work too much .
thank you . can i cancel my reservation ?
what ?
tomorrow ? no i 'm afraid i would n't be able to . i 'm going out of the town on business .
me too . how about this evening ? i can have a great time .
tomorrow morning .
i was hoping to talk to you about but i could t give you some time off .
no i have n't but i 've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper .
what kind of job are you looking for ?
i 'm trying to find a job in sound engineering .
you have n't had any experience in either of those fields .
i know . but i 'd like to try . look here are some advertisements that i 've cut out .
i was turned down again . it s frustrating . i guess you ve got to teach me some skills .
me ? i m even less experienced than you are .
at least you know what american women generally like in a man .
believe it or not i guess american women like a man in good shape which chinese women may not care about so much . that s my honest opinion . i know you have been trying very hard .
american men are naturally taller than chinese men . so even if i exercise there aren t many chances .
no that s not true . i ve met two american women who were married to chinese . but those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is jacky chan ? he s small and short . but i bet he can have any american woman he wants . but i bet he wants .
you know that s going to be a tremendous change for me . because i never exercise .
why don t you try then ? it s more important to quit smoking .
hi don . what a surprise !
yeah i saw someone walking like you but i wasn t sure . we haven t seen each other for how long ? almost three months ? but you look quite different now .
have you noticed what has changed ?
oh you look quite slender and more <unk> . what have you been taking ? are you on a diet ?
yes . i m on a diet but i ve not taken anything . i just eat less and exercise more . and it really worked in the past three months . i ve lost twelve pounds .
wow ! that s great . i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals but it s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . also you know old habits are hard to break .
what kind of exercise do you think i do ? i just go to dance everyday after work . i m taking an amateur dance class . i dance two hours everyday .
dance ? you only go dancing ? that s not hard . i can do that .
sure . join my class next week .
fine . would you like to have lunch some day next week ?
hey ! what is it ?
everyone is really a good game .
yeah .
what ?
ok let 's go .
wow !
let s go to the inquiry desk first to check it out .
yes . i have been informed that there are many opportunities to move up in this company .
well i 'm afraid it is our policy .
what about that ?
yes .
i see . well that 's a very good one . if you are interested you can give me the name of the person you are looking for .
like what ?
but i 'm not sure about it .
yes . i 've never been here before . it 's my first time to move .
i guess you 're right . sometimes they seem to focus on their own .
really ? i 've been watching that before .
i do n't know . i think the fish is the most important thing .
c 'mon . i 'm not a <unk> . we could n't just move .
well why not ?
oh i see .
i think so . all the men have spoken english to the attention .
you 're right . the problem is that the restaurant is we have now <unk> on this .
i 'm going to work .
no early saturday morning .
wow ! i hope i can do it .
well you know it 's a time to get together with all your family and be thankful for everything !
yes it 's a combination of getting on the original screen and it has a pretty good voice !
you 're right . the brazilian is really hard for us .
i 'm on a diet . and i do more exercise .
oh i 've take the things that are n't going with me . i want to take the apples in the shop .
yes . it is a popular place .
i 've heard about that before . what do you think ?
the same in america is that people in my country is not the same as other westerners .
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
well the riverside mall has 200 stores in it including four major department stores .
what is it ?
i do n't like any one .
yes i have .
where is the office ?
i 'm afraid that i 'm very ill .
what ? you don t have to worry about me like that ?
i see .
five hundred yuan .
that sounds like a good idea .
how about this one ? it s on sale for 80 dollars .
it was n't just like that . . we 've got to focus on our own .
thank you very much .
what did you do there ?
okay . i ll pick you up around 6
it s a romantic meeting this morning . i can say that the subway is on fast .
it was a pleasure .
well you should keep an eye on it . don t worry . it s not the fault of our company .
yeah . i m so excited .
i want a different hair style .
well do you have any outside income from a rental property or a trust ?
well what about the accounts ?
yes . i heard it is really great to see some <unk> in my country .
it is worth 100 yuan .
i see . what about us ?
but he has no authority . he 's a hard worker here but he always gets angry with himself and he doesn t .
ok i will be sending them by next week .
well it 's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . so unfortunately you 'll lose this 50 rib . we 'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .
i see . why not use wooden cases ?
i am sure i have . the doctor works very well .
quite well . thank you .
so how come you are so calm . we 'll never be long .
i was robbed .
what s new friends in beijing ?
ok . see you later !
what a pity ! we should have come out and watch the tv .
of course not . i 've had the most bad news .
i will explain the problem briefly . we found in the examination that 35 of the goods have damaged .
well you can say that again . it 's not as bad as that . . .
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
a new girlfriend is a far cry from ann . she is like a breath of fresh air .
it 's been a long time has n't it ? how are you ?
we arrived in the same hotel . we arrived at 10 o clock and watched the same table .
you know that we could get started on a new home computer here .
what s wrong with it ?
well i ll see you after we can walk around there .
thanks i don t think i ve ever read a good picture of this letter . it looks more interesting than some old ones .
it does n't matter but it needs to be close to the subway .
yes it s been affordable too .
it 's a onebedroom onebathroom apartment .
yes i agree .
they are . i wish they would do a good job .
true but the price is super .
yes it 's fully furnished .
is there a bathroom ?
thanks to the offer .
i promise you 'll have it tomorrow .
no way ! i m sure you d do well . we have been in touch with that area for more than one year .
thank you .
do you really think so ?
yes . good for you .
i think in some way it is an act of god but in another way it just is caused by us .
for example ?
we did n't pay attention to the environment cut down trees and polluted the air .
oh i see . fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things .
really ? that 's a straws in the wind .
i think so . maybe he 's fallen for her .
yeah . they suit each other . a perfect match between a man and a girl .
it 's nice . but i like it very much .
oh you look a bit tired .
well you have to .
that 's very nice of you .
well take it easy . the food is good for you . but you should try it sometime .
mom please .
i can t be there .
we 're going to need to charge you a dollar bill .
i know but i 'm hungry .
no i think i 'll go for the japanese restaurant just like that .
you 'll have to try it .
it 's very different from chinese food but i do n't like it .
what about your friend ?
what kind of food do you like to eat ?
well i guess you 're right . the world is just what i want to do .
that 's fate .
i feel sorry for her .
maybe this is god 's will .
we have two cleaning ladies . but both of them have received little education .
most cleaning ladies are illiterate . but some of them do a very nice job .
but i actually dislike another lady . she is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . but the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . she would tell you what to do and where to put things .
well i am a little bit out of shape . i think i should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ?
you should n't be too <unk> . you can do some jogging .
it is a small world !
we provide uptodate training on state of the art equipment .
i know . i 'm always full of energy and enthusiasm . when i take a fitness assessment you can watch a few courses on tv .
well we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . the trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the workout plan .
what else ?
since everyone is different your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . then you 'llbe taught all the necessary techniques to us
sounds pretty good . how much do you charge ?
the service charge is 1 of the total amount of the check .
perhaps one month . i 'll just have a try at first .
i do n't think so .
yes . i like gardening .
oh that s interesting and but what kind of things ?
several things for example various coins stamps stones and so on .
stones ? i know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?
yes stones .
well i can t just image it .
i 'm fine . how are you ?
of course it 's a trade story . many of my talk is n't it ?
i 'm sorry to hear that .
can you tell me something about your outstanding achievements ?
you said it . it 's been going to be a good night !
business . and you ?
but i 've never gone to the movies .
i 'm pretty good .
wait for a minute .
oops wait . you 've done a lot .
yeah . i will be there .
they look all right to me .
i like swimming best .
i do n't like the weather like this . i wish it were summer .
i am just watching tv .
oh she 's a pretty woman .
do n't worry . no big deal . just a common cold .
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
now let 's board the boat and have a ride on the lake .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . let 's see . . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
let 's just hope it does n't get hotter .
hey i 'm the same with you !
oh you know i 'm a bit italian . i think i 'm glad i won t be able to learn any spanish well .
i ca n't speak them .
oh really ? i 've heard a lot about listen to music .
excellent . i got a few of the courses i took .
do you have any ideas ?
yes . you can study for two universities but you might have to experience in the tourism industry .
well i do n't think it 's the best idea for me . you know i studied here as a teacher .
thank you .
it 's true . but i do n't know what to do .
i 'm having a party at my house .
right there 's no doubt in the third class .
i was there .
thank you . i have made an offer in the fourth day .
i hope to study english literature .
great . then can you tell me something about the teachers ?
you 're an excellent student . you 're an excellent student . i 'll make a note of it .
have you tried university parttime jobs ?
so i will .
yeah it deserves its name .
oh yes . i remember . the estimate is quite what we have in mind . i bet you would be quite willing to do the same .
good idea .
sure . but you know that i ca n't read any chinese characters .
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
it 's interesting and i want to buy one home .
yeah . it deserves its name .
yeah . i like the gift too .
yes . i think the sunshine is very good . how about you ?
you got it . thanks for your help .
it 's a good idea . i want to try it on .
it is easy . the world is still in the world .
thank you .
no i think that i am going to be a firstclass swimmer .
can i get it on a computer ?
what 's the matter ?
you 're kidding !
if i were you i 'd buy one .
is it made of pure gold ?
oh that 's nice . i 'd like to say that i was really looking for a job for my mother .
good idea .
yeah . it s a good school .
the money will be 3 dollars .
the food there is actually pretty good .
if you open up a card you can save 10 on all your purchases today .
the most important thing is to make sure the person is trained <unk> . the food is a little different .
i m afraid they re not locked up in the u . s .
how old is she ?
yeah . it 's a traditional chinese culture .
i ca n't see it .
you like the food there ?
i know . i intend to go to the store today .
you like the food there ?
yes . it is also very popular in all areas . the traditional local customs and family have been good for their sake . and i love it .
you can t compare apples and oranges . i believe that both topics are important and that we can t ignore them the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . i believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching .
no ! i am not really interested in those games .
yes it is . this is can t wait to interrupt but there are some forbidden spots .
would you please ask him to call chris when he gets back ?
well i wish you good luck !
which is more expensive ?
i think you should open the beginning of the day .
but i ca n't find a place where that is .
yes . when i asked you to call the information management information i want to ask you . and your secretary to go into any office . she said she was visiting .
but i do n't believe in them . the prices are higher than with my home .
i have to work this tuesday .
yeah i like buying a house . i m not good at it .
yes . in fact there is only a few minutes left .
i got the message . i 'm quiting .
what is your purpose of that ?
what is it ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
i like all kinds of movies .
i like dogs . they have been used as guards for centuries . nowadays they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers .
yeah . it 's a terrible movie .
no i would n't . i do n't like them .
what 's the difference ?
well that 's a lot of money . let 's go to the lake first and see what we can do .
look at the flowers over there . can you help me to look ?
you 're telling me .
do n't worry about it . it 's not serious .
look at that big tree over there .
yeah oh my god ! it s still there . we have our first date right on there .
wow . i 'm just warming up !
you seemed to be dull at that time .
but i could n't make it much longer than a month .
smile i can t believe this for it s been 20 years since we got married .
what type of movie is that ?
yes . it was about 45 minutes ago .
you mean the movie of the movie . have you watched it ?
what 's the weather report ?
but they are n't as light right ?
what other kind of food do you like ?
oh no . there is n't . what 's it ?
sure i love it . you know it is a good place for a picnic .
but iq is decided at birth . it can be helpful to keep active .
you are right !
of course not . go ahead .
it 's a good idea . what 's on tonight ?
it 's about time to go and i 'm watching a movie .
it 's a 14 .
she liked to be a enjoyed it .
you like her . she s pretty but she seems to be quite depressed .
i like girls who are more independent .
the movie ?
i 'm not sure but i think it 's about bob .
kobe is a good player .
you 're right . the movie industry is becoming more and more popular . he also wants to be a star for one person with star on the american history of rose .
certainly .
oh i feel terrible .
there s so much i want to do . i ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . i just ran a search for music to download .
i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
thanks . that would be very helpful . i ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . there s too much information on the net .
when you sent your emails did you attach any files to them ?
yes i did . there s an antivirus programme with my email account that <unk> all attachments so i m sure i haven t sent anything nasty to anyone .
when you use the internet be careful not to give out your email address very often . if you do you might get a lot of <unk> email form companies trying to sell you things .
that s good advice . i should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself such as my password and credit car number .
that s right . another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time
how do i do that ?
take some pictures of the thing you want to sell then upload it onto line with a brief description about it and leave your connecting number . then your stuff will be sold by auction .
that s useful to know . thanks . i ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .
really ? i m not sure that i would like all the attention . there have been numerous cases of paparazzi <unk> with star s private live in recent years .
i love being <unk> ! if i were famous i d do interviews for all the top magazines like cosmo and elle .
i wouldn t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice but it would get tedious after a while . imagine the things the things the gossip columnists would write about you .
noone really believes gossip columnists .
i think you ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . you d also have to be very careful about every word you said . if you <unk> on a chat show and said something silly it
yes i wouldn t agree with you more . we could do a lot of charity work when i m here .
that s a great idea . which charities would you support ?
i love children as you know so probably a children s charity .
you d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity so you d really need to be very careful . anyway i d be the first to buy your posters and i d attend your first book
ok i can help you with that .
yes it is . thanks . i m just surfing on the internet .
here ? in this cafe ? how can you do that ?
this cafe offers a wireless internet connection . that means i can get on the net for free while i m here . of course i have to buy a cup of coffee !
that s great ! can you do it anywhere ?
no . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . there are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
so what programs do you have on your laptop ?
i ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs .
i know you are keen on photography . it s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone anywhere at a
it s a good idea to learn the skills of the mobile phone . it gives people a good attitude which is a good opportunity to use .
yes i do . i also use an antispyware program and a firewall . there are so many <unk> on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . you have to be very c
how often do you run your antivirus program ?
i usually run it every few days . it finds a virus about half the time .
which antivirus program would you recommend ?
have you tried this one ? it s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . you can also download updates for free .
that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ?
just a minute . . . go to this one . i ll send you an email with the line in it . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the set up procedures . but they are not complicated .
what do you use your computer for ?
i use it for several thingssurfing the net word processing and creating presentations . i don t play many games on my computer but i do a lot of work with photographs . using a computer program you
computers are great aren t they ? i should download some programs and learn how to use them .
i use it almost every day but i usually only use it to check my email . i don t often surf the net . you use the internet a lot don t you ?
yes . i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . it can be frustrating when the connection is poor .
so you re lucky !
yes i like the job though . sometimes i help other people in the office if they re having trouble online .
how useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?
i think it s fairly useful but there are two big problems . first a lot of the information you find online is false . second when you buy something online you don t see it until you actually get it .
how do you solve the website problems when you re buying something online ?
what i do is find the website of shops . then someone from our company <unk> the shop and buys when they re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .
i d say the main reason is poverty . countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . if their neighbors have some resources they try to steal them by military force .
it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end .
how do you think they could be ended ?
i don t think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . the thing is to find the real pro
so if the cause is poverty there should be a program to make the country richer . if the problem is resources share them .
it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality it 's harder to make peace between countries .
yes . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .
the problem is that many poor people might suffer .
would you like to live in the country ? i m not sure i d like it .
i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that for me each advantage has its own disadvantage .
what do you mean ?
i want a different hair style .
it s a pity . we can t really use the city .
people can t have it both ways . if you live in the country it is often less convenient . if you live in a city it is noisy buy there s more to do .
i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they re so much better to look at than concrete rows of parked cars and tall buildings .
i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . when the wind blows in the city you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .
the view from the hill is so beautiful . the village looks so beautiful .
just remember that in that village there s nothing to do . there s not even a pub or restaurant . there s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .
you re right . i would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . i would hate living in the country !
yeah !
yes . i m a little nervous .
i m sorry .
me too . but i think it 's too difficult for us to make sure everyone knows what 's wrong with us .
according to the article you have to find almost a few foreign companies .
i see . do you have any questions ?
we did n't pay attention to the environment cut down trees and polluted the air .
reasonable .
why not ! it s a classic in fact it s one of my favorite novels .
but it s so old .
don t judge a book by its cover . do you kwon what it s about ?
no i didn t .
how about drink ?
i didn t realize it was a romance novel . what s the main storyline ?
it s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .
why does he want to do that ?
he has a lot of work on it .
won t they get his inheritance ?
no that s the problem . though they are welloff once he dies his house will go to his cousin . so when he dies the girls will have nothing .
i see . this sounds interesting ! maybe my teacher isn t so horrible after all .
so are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
there s movie ? my teacher didn t tell me that !
that s probably because she wants you to read the book first .
it would take a lot less time . .
how about this . when you finish the book . i ll get the movie and watch it with you .
ok . that sounds like a deal .
i only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . i don t think that tv is bad for kids . i think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes .
perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first .
if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch remember to have something else for them to do . if you don t they ll get bored and misbehave .
they could go out and play with their friends .
sure . you could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time .
perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . he watches too much tv too .
that s a good idea . remember that if the parents watch too much tv the kids will probably follow suit .
i like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . but i don t like traveling to work waiting for buses or . . .
or getting stuck in traffic jams when you re driving .
exactly .
it 's gone with the wind .
why do you like it best ?
i enjoy the various characters and the plot .
well . i like the thorn birds best .
is it very interesting ?
sure . i like the writer 's language too .
if i have a chance i 'll enjoy the book .
would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
that 's a good idea . let 's go !
it 's the best seller everyone 's been talking about for the last six months .
how in the world did you get a copy ? i 've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i 'm still waiting my turn .
i checked it out of the rental library . it only costs five cents a day .
is it really worth paying for ?
i ca n't tell yet . i have n't got beyond the first chapter .
if it 's any good i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
not a great deal .
i 've just been reading an article about them . they ll be used for all sorts of things now .
for accounting system and things like that you mean ?
yes but they are used for other things too . do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to paris .
yes ?
i bought one size up by mistake .
of course his machine must have been connected to a computer .
that 's right .
oh you know my friend is getting married .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and and and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people were sick it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i had a small one would n't drop on the cover charge and a small one should probably the cover charge and when i wanted to myself even a small one should probably
i want a different hair style .
that 's right .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
oh what s he like ?
well he s got dark hair and brown eyes .
yes .
i got the message . i 'm quiting .
um that s good .
yes but he s got a wife and 3 children as well .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .
what happened ? you look so pale .
i stayed up last night .
what makes you say that ?
i do n't see anything wrong with what we 're doing ! that 's just the problem . in these kind of things the trouble does n't always appear at first .
oh that 's too bad . work harder next term .
b i 'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me .
do n't lose heart . everything will be fine .
thank you . that 's very kind of you .
yes of course . this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
i m glad you re enjoying it .
thank you for the invitation .
it s my pleasure . can i get you another glass of champagne ?
yes please . thank you for everything .
sorry i can t .
tomorrow night then ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
that s sounds great .
i guess i can help you with both .
no . i d better not .
why not ?
i have to work this tuesday .
i m looking at my horoscope for this month ! my outlook is very positive . it says that i should take a vacation to someplace exotic and that i will have a passionate summer fling !
what are you talking about ? let me see that . . . what are <unk> ?
it s a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign . you have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . i was born on april 15th so i m an aries . when were you born ?
january 5th .
let s see . . . you re a capricorn . it says that you will be feeling stress at work but you could see new exciting developments in your love life . looks like we ll both have interesting summers !
that s bogus . i do n't feel any stress at work and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
no it s not your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . see ? it says that an aries is energetic and loves to socialize .
well you certainly match those criteria but they re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ?
a capricorn is <unk> and practical . she likes to do things in conventional ways . that sounds just like you !
ok ! how about <unk> ?
no no a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . i m going to describe someone s face and you guess who it is !
ok !
what 's the matter ?
our cousin pete ! my turn ! she has a <unk> nose <unk> eyes and a mole on her chin !
aunt rose ! that mole is so huge ! ok my turn . he has a crooked nose and full lips . he has quite a few freckles and an oval face . oh he is also bald !
your future husband !
not funny .
i 'm watching tv .
mumm . no .
it s only the day when the world s biggest sporting event is kicking off .
what ?
i said bonjour !
i have no idea what you re talking about . the only sporting event we watch at home is the super bowl .
this is bigger than the super bowl man ! teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . they first start in a group stage with bigger groups each g
sounds interesting but soccer doesn t really appeal to me .
are you kidding ? over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup ! it s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! each nation is cheering on their team hoping they will bec
what kind of play is that ?
whatever i m going to go watch the opening match .
mine was ok except that no one in my class speaks english . i guess it will force me to <unk> in chinese more in class so at least i should improve a lot this semester .
that s both fortunate and unfortunate . it s the united nations in my class ! we have people from all over the world ! there are three germans a pole a scottish two french an american a brazilian
yes . everyone is from the united states . there s a lot of rules in australia . perhaps we should go to the ideal college .
well i think you re pretty lucky actually . you ll have the opportunity to learn so much about asian culture .
i guess so but i think it s going to be hard to relate to my classmates especially with the language barrier . i think i might change classes .
don t ! stay the course ! your spoken chinese will be eternally grateful . i bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice .
i highly doubt it . your girlfriend is chinese .
well there is that yes .
it s a perfect spot ! this is the perfect season season i can see it ! the kids keep their hair out !
there we go . can you help me with the umbrella ? perfect .
ok kids here <unk> beach ball and a frisbee a pail and a shovel . i want to see an impressive <unk> by the time we leave . don t stray too far . wait ! leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes
and stay in the shallow area . i don t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! it s too deep out there and we didn t bring your floatier .
you re back already ? the water was too cold huh ? i ll tell you a secret . do you see that small pool of water over there ? it ll be warmer in there . go see if you can find some seashells or catch some
what is that ? a jellyfish ? jeremy put that down right now . . .
ah ! not on me ! ow !
i want to think of it for some time .
i d like to .
what are you talking about ? where is your halloween spirit ? didn t you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trickortreating with your friends ?
yeah i m glad to hear that . you re right . we should be able to find some quiet airfare . we can go home .
she is a famous american musician .
i know ! it s a good idea to see your eyes and tell me how much i can get there .
no . i 'm afraid i have n't had time since i got married .
whoa ! i think i might have a lot of work in this ! are we getting a good position ?
your throat is inflamed . and your tongue is heavily coated . you have all the symptoms of influenza .
thanks . what kind of guarantee are you looking for ?
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
i do n't know . do you think you ll like the house ?
ok .
that s great . do you have any other questions ?
honey seriously it s just a sheep . relax ! relax that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable .
what a beautiful home !
yeah i m sorry . . . .
i m sorry to hear that .
it 's nice . but we have always dreamed of owning our own home .
that was a great shot ! a three pointer yeah !
thank you for your reminding .
do you think that s a good idea ?
oh come on ! i ve been through this already ! i ve got a flat tyre .
i am not a thief vicki . and i guess it 's just a waste of time .
it s really a good game .
yeah definitely . but i ve got to go .
hey i m not a thief .
really ? i m sorry . i don t understand .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
ben we re fifteen . what kind of job are you looking for ?
oh just for a position as a gas station attendant . you know starting at a simple lowly job just like all the greats before they made it big in the world .
uhhuh .
but i m just in it for the money right ? how else am i going to be able to afford to keep taking angela to the movies ? besides i love the smell of gasoline don t you ?
yeah ? you finally decided to wipe the slate clean ?
you got it ! i have a new job i m living in a new city with new friends ! this is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way i live my life .
so what are you going to do ? take up an art class or something ?
well first of all i ve decided to stop smoking . it s not that i m pinching pennies or anything it s just that i ve been smoking since i was sixteen and i think it s time to stop .
i m with you on that one . anything else you re planning on doing ?
one last thing i ve decided to come out of the closet .
it s about time !
what s the matter ? you are the best things i can do .
i am going to the mountains ! i m being alone in the morning !
my first grandchild .
look at the crystal clear fridge . you can see so many kinds of pets !
well thanks for your help !
thanks for reminding me . i m being a real man .
ok thank you .
yeah but it s a good question . . . well it s really hard to make our sense .
well i do n't know what to order . do you have a wine list ?
here you are .
i 'm going to <unk> the lawn .
i prefer the fish .
how about drinks ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i 'm not sure . what do you think of your own food ?
how do you know there was a breakin ?
a movie or a movie ?
how about you ?
nice to see you too .
it s easy !
hello jack . it s a long time to see the doctor . how are you doing ?
thanks .
how would you like to pay ?
i have a lot of homework .
what ?
what 's more it 's only ten minutes walk to the company .
i will .
i 'm not sure . what time should we meet ?
i do n't know what we need .
no problem .
ok .
so do i .
what 's the date today ?
i was invited to my sister 's and i think it 's going to be a lot of fun .
i am not feeling all the great .
by the way do i need to take a shower first ?
yes i find jogging does good to me so i keep on doing it .
you 've formed a sound habit .
i think so too .
yes we are .
to tell you the truth a lot is to do .
i do n't know maybe one hundred .
that 's not bad . i heard there was an opera fans club in beijing .
oh come on . i ve worked out a little overtime .
well i suppose you are right . what do you think then ?
the first thing is that you 've been watching movies at a time . the movie is all about a person 's old movies .
yeah i guess i could . i think it 's a bit too scary .
that s unless there is a traffic jam .
i do n't think it 's any of our customers .
we also need some meat .
that 's not good .
yes i have heard that . as you know your city is a little familiar with other people from other countries .
yeah . i heard about that . let 's go and get some drink .
the cranberries . i love their music . how about you ? do you like them ?
i think it 's a good movie .
he 's a hero in our town .
i 'd like a cup of coffee please .
what kind of tea do you like ?
i started to learn english when i was in primary school .
not yet . i am still looking . but i 'm not sure if it 's normal .

i promise i will .
no i m not .
wow ! this sounds like something my wife would really enjoy ! are there any outdoor activities we can get into ?
next year ?
do you think a lot of people have any questions ?
george how can we ? vacations cost money . and this month we don t have much money left after paying the rent .
well lili we can visit different places in the state in our van . we are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . trust me it won t cost much .
where will we sleep then ?
in the van .
what about other expenses ?
let s see . gas food recreation we won t spend much . come on . don t hesitate . we need to get out of the house once in a while . we have been working hard haven t we ?
maybe you re right . when do you plan to go ?
the sooner the better ! i can t wait !
oh i don t know where we re going yet .
as long as we re going you can decide where to go . i trust your <unk> . i know you miss chinese food so we can eat at a chinese restaurant this time .
let s go to chicago . we can have lunch in chinatown . then we can go to a ball game at <unk> field !
wait a minute ! i am really sorry !
i found the ideal position . i m working for a plumbing company .
are you serious ? you studied mathematics at college for four years and now you have a job working with your hands !
plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge and creativity . i love this job .
i can see that . but i didn t know you had experience in that line of work .
i didn t but i applied for an apprenticeship and since i studied math and since i studied math and i have a good attitude 4 my application was accepted .
congratulations ! you do have the right attitude .
did you have to take a medical before you go to the police ?
you can list your education at the top or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive .
it is the best season to view from the world .
do n't be silly . i 'll teach you how to use it .
tell me about the job .
what s your favorite course daniel ?
i have a lot of weight .
i can never forget it .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
i have studied on a business trip with my parents .
in my opinion you re a good fit for this position . how about a lizard ? are you sound very smart ?
well i used to swim quite a lot . but i 've got a good feeling that runs on a business trip .
do you like to sleep or do some exercise ?
that s what my computer is showing .
i m afraid not . i still have to learn something new .
palmistry ? what is that ?
it 's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future .
oh you mean palm reading . i 've seen that before but i do n't believe in it .
are you sure ? i 've read a lot about palmistry and i 've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . do you want me to take a look at your hand ?
really ? you 've read books about it ? ok then . but only if you want to .
ok let 's see well you 've got a long life line which is good and the love line is strong . . .
what else do you see ? will i be successful ? will i make a lot of money ?
hmm hard to say wait yes it looks like you will do well in business and your ambition will help you a lot but . . .
what ? what is it ? what is it ? what is it ?
i 'm sorry to say that we have to let you go john .
really ? what 's the difference ?
no not really . why do you ask ?
well i 've never been to either so i was thinking of going to disneyworld for my honeymoon .
you saw a ghost ? when ?
it was many years ago when i was a little child . it was the middle of the night and i went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . i walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs when . . .
that 's good . have you ever been in bed before ?
it was a big green thing that looked like a person . it was in the kitchen and it slowly moved towards the stairs . . .
so what did you do ?
i helped build the sets and find props for the plays . what about you ?
until what ? what happened ? did you see it clearly ? did you attack the victim ?
it moved slowly up the stairs step by step and i could hear its approaching footsteps . when it finally got to the top of the stairs i realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . he had gone to get a late night snack .
i just found out that my husband is cheating on me .
you mean mark ? he seems like such an honest guy .
that 's what i thought . it seems that he 's been seeing someone else for about two months .
two months ? how did you find out ?
i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . i picked it up and a girl asked to talk to mark . she then asked if i was his sister and i said no i was his wife . she hung up immediately .
so you asked him about the girl who called ?
yeah he first said it was someone from work . he gave me a lame excuse and so i pressed him on it .
what 'd he do ?
he kept trying to make stupid excuses and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion .
so what happened in the company ?
two years .
it s unbelievable .
i think that s the reason why i m here to get this position . i can t afford to lose weight !
yes . thanks .
that 's not bad .
let s get a costume and you ll be able to keep up the things that you re gonna go on . then i m going to go jogging and get away very easily . it s <unk> !
that s good . have you ever been there ?
it would be hard to get a job like that . but i m afraid i have to improve my english more .
really ? in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and i think it s mainly for them to give the immediate confirm .
some of my friends play cards on the internet . if you aren t too much trouble you should learn to carry and learn something about them .
well it s not like that . we just have to cut back on my bed . it s really hard to get up but now . if you break down and get drunk in a bad place you should probably get used to an early morning .
that 's great . i can go to the supermarket and see how the ladies are .
nothing really .
it 's interesting . have you ever been an automobile company ?
yes i 'm looking for a onebedroom apartment .
it 's a <unk> question . they 're right to get into the museum of the national opera star .
what am i going to do ?
come on in early in the afternoon you can be up and enjoy the weekend . it 's necessary for you to have a rest .
i like the oscars . this game has some great questions about all types of movies .
he 's such a handsome guy .
how do you pay for it ?
i 'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments .
tell me if you need help .
no i am not eating there anymore . i have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . the food served in the cafeteria is not my type . i am a total meat lover . but the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . they have been serving the chinese cabbage and
that s fine with me . i don t hate vegetables and i don t eat much during lunch .
well then the cafeteria suits you best . but anyway if you like to have a lunch outside the company feel free to join me anytime .
i 'm going to graduate this summer .
where are you going to work then in australia or back in china ?
i 'm planning to return to china after graduation .
why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad .
well i think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment .
yeah china 's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country .
of course ! it is the no . 1 <unk> in my life . you know job stress has become a very common problem these days . so we must learn to cope with it .
totally agree . what is your solution ?
well there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress both we and the companies should do something . for me i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know all work and no play make jack a dull boy .
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
but i don t think we can change our working condition . anyway we are not the bosses .
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them like <unk> <unk> deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
he 's not only the right person to say anything . but his wife did n't want to hear me .
cool ! is n't that a hot day ?
no they had no reason to ask for arresting me .
right so the deposit if you are n't hurt your bank will be closed to collect right ?
thank you for your help .
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart and he has a great sense of humor .
yes next march .
well the minister at my church told us about it and it was quite new .
on the contrary we are the basically now .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
just like a little more .
time flies . let 's meet you at the club at seven thirty .
what 's the matter ?
ok .
your usual shirt and shoes .
hmm . . . you look too dressed up .
i guess we should .
i don t like the color .
it 's ok .
what would you like to drink ?
i 'm so excited .
i 'm serious .
all right . next time you will treat .
i think we should also have a try .
maybe . i 'll try some day .
you 're right .
are you sure ?
no sir .
i think i 'll try it .
follow me into the kitchen . you will love it .
like what ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
yeah you are right . i m too busy to do a lot of things .
i got a sandwich in a couple of days ago .
that sounds good .
take the next right . drive about one click further and you ll see the entrance of the highway to the great wall .
then you 'd better email her my address . or i will call her later .
it 's for you .
i will be careful with it .
sorry mum i 'll lock it right away .
certainly . just call me when you have a seat .
have you got a temperature ?
good idea .
i 'd like to eat a bowl of dumplings .
i 'm fine .
but let 's go to the gym and have a good time .
oh no . we used to go to the gym ! i thought i was coming up with my mother !
yes it 's definitely a growing game .
but you did n't have to win for it .
no .
then he must be very famous .
did you know he was disqualified ?
what type of movie do you like to see ?
and can i help you with anything ?
are you busy ?
yes . i ve got a suit and those immediately .
what about this one ?
sorry but he 's busy then too .
that 's great . i hope i see you again soon .
when you lent me the bike it looked brand new almost anyway .
i like spring .
i prefer summer especially the summer evenings . when the sun comes down it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . after a rain shower the smell of the air is refreshing .
how do you get through the stuffy daytime ?
well i have to hide in the airconditioned rooms . anyway it is all worth just think about the cool evening time .
fantastic ! i enjoy clubbing especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad full of smoke and the music is too loud so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
how did that happen ?
his car was hit by an express train . it happened at the crossing just behind his house .
sounds cool ! but that is not what a lady should do . people are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk .
oh that sounds great !
okay . thank you very much .
maybe . i 'm hoping to get a hold of my good life .
yeah .
why do n't you speak english ?
they did .
what was the score ?
china beat brazil 3 to 0 .
wonderful !
anne ! i have n't seen you for ages . how 've you been ?
fine just fine . and you ?
not so well . i 've come down with the flu .
i went to visit my sister in the city . i was in new york in london .
better take the subway . it s faster and more convenient .
en where do we pay the fares ?
we have a rather comprehensive subway system here . you can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy .
where can we get both at the station ?
follow me please .
oh can i leave the keys on the platform ?
cash credit card or debit card ?
there 's a bank near here .
well i want to go to the supermarket first .
no you do n't have to .
really ? i did n't know that . but i did n't know how to pay for them . can i have a try ?
i am sorry you ca n't borrow a jacket and a tie .
then we 'll return to the hotel and come back will you change the appointment ?
certainly what time will you come back ?
at 7 please .
here 's your bill . please check it .
just two .
wow what a beautiful party .
er . . . hum . . . got it .
then open that window . yeah that one .
right !
and that 's it . you 're done .
i see what you mean . that was pretty easy after all .
no .
oh is it ? thank you anyway .
you 're welcome .
he is . he s the guy who works well with .
i had a bad dream . i was walking alone in the graveyard and suddenly all the ghosts jumped out of their graves . they began to chase me through the graveyard and shouted that they wanted my blood .
that 's unbelievable . why did this happen ?
i do n't understand of myself . it seems they have to save money .
i see what you mean . i think they could give me a free drink .
yeah it was nice to meet you .
nice to meet you too .
have you ever been to a movie ?
ok . let s go .
yes . he is in a meeting .
i 'm glad that you saw the stop do n't you ?
and a storm blew our roof away .
emm . . . yes . but i was n't too impressed . i found her a little stuck up .
you are kidding but she 's so helpful .
tom . . . you are her boss you down . of course she 's helpful to you .
come on . she 's like that with everyone .
i do n't think so actually . she never even says hello to me .
thank you . but a number of things have been going wrong lately .
what have you been doing ?
oh the whole house needs repainting for starters . the carpet in the living room is worn out and i 'd like to put in new walltowall carpeting . last week i had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . anyway all par for the course when you own a house i guess . i am going to hire an interior <unk> to look the place over . i think i can
i 've studied home decoration as a hobby . could i make some suggestions ?
go right ahead .
i m afraid you ll become angry . but i think i must tell you .
wow you really do have a talent for this alice . thanks for the suggestions .
you are welcome jack . glad to be of help .
oh i did n't . it was too hot .
i agree with you . but i think you ll find the wrong size .
yes . the special effects were amazing but i got a bit confused . the plot was too complicated for me .
but these people say not to think of their words . sometimes they have the same feeling you know .
hello is doris available ?
hi alex !
pleased to meet you . my name is alice . did you just move in next door ?
yes i did . have you lived here long ?
me ? i guess so . i 've lived here for about six years now . have you lived in america very long ?
no not really . when i left vietnam i came to america and i lived with a cousin in dallas for two years . where do you work alice ?
i teach mathematics at a college . what do you do ?
i am an accountant at a company .
well tom . it 's good to meet you . i have to go now . i am teaching a class this evening and i need to get to the college .
it 's nice meeting you too alice .
see you around !
goodbye alice .
thank you . it 's a pleasure to meet you .
the pleasure is mine .
thank you they are beautiful .
well honestly speaking i do n't want to give up smoking .
sure it is . let 's ask .
then i 'll buy the drink .
after a while we have n't seen you for ages .
really ? how come ?
yes . this is my first time to be out of the office .
do you want to hurt yourself ?
here you are .
that 's very strict . thanks very much .
i usually eat a lot of vegetables when i eat a lot of bad dishes .
i m so glad we eat .
i stayed up last night .
did you have something on your mind ? you look so concerned ! maybe i can help you .
well i 'm under a lot of pressure .
is there anything i can do for you ?
yes . i am looking for a pair of gloves .
well my neighbor hit my brother on the head . he s bleeding . we need to get a lot of blood .
what 's the matter ?
a little but not much .
well you should have been . do you think you can finish it for another day ?
for more than five years .
all right ! i m going to the the medical center .
i see . the doctor says that i ca n't eat too much .
well suffer then . if you have a toothache you have to go to the dentist .
no we do n't . we 're going to have to pay for the room .
yeah the government really takes a bite doesn t it ?
no it is n't . but it 's very difficult to learn .
yeah i think it 's just the same as yours .
i want to do it but i ve got a little trouble .
yeah my grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive .
let s just hope the politicians don t figure out a way to spend it .
really ? no they couldn t . none of them would have jobs if they did .
that 's a switch .
what was the weather like in new york ?
i 'm not sure . i could n't eat any ice cream though .
not at all . take a seat . how can i help you ?
how about afternoon ?
laura .
do you like this place ?
i don t think it s very nice . and my father doesn t like it . but my mother likes it very much . so we often come here .
how often ?
three times a year at most . how do you feel about this ?
who s that ?
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
do you like swimming ?
no i hate swimming . i prefer playing tennis .

well i m a little worried about my family .

i think i have enough time . but it is better than enough to go .

tasha mountain ? it 's very famous in china is n't ?
by train . it 's cheaper .
my house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture .
no wonder you look so upset . have you called the police ?
no . i have to wait .
probably . but i think it 's better for skating .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
would you like to see the summer mountain ?
i want to go see a walk .
i want a different hair style .
okay .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
what 's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
cloudy in the morning overcast in the afternoon .
that does n't sound pretty .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
well i was going to drive to birmingham to see some friends .
you might want to change your plans . with the cold and wet weather that we 're supposed to have tomorrow the roads are going to be rather slippery .
i suppose i should . do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
i just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
if you 're lucky it 'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !
if that happens then i 'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
that sounds like fun .
do you think you can come ?
english weather is even more predictable than i had previously thought .
yes i ve just got all my money here .
what are you doing ?
i 'm watching tv .
how old is he today ?
he 's over sixty .
well wish him a happy birthday for me .
sure thing . what are your plans for the evening ?
i was just thinking of going to a movie tonight .
well if you can wait until tomorrow night i 'll go with you then .
sorry i 've got people coming over tomorrow night .
sounds like this weekend just is n't going to work out for us .
we should probably think about it but i 'll see you tomorrow .
sure . hey i 'm sorry but i 've got to get going .
yeah me too . it 's about time i made a move .
say hello to your friends for me .
likewise . see you later .
bye !
it 's beethoven . do you like it ?
i think beethoven's music is incredible . i 've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent too . do you believe that ?
i do n't know about that but i do think that it helps people relax .
what other kind of music do you listen to ?
classic . something that could calm your mind .
to be honest i think classical music is too complicated for me .
what kind of music do you prefer then ?
i like pop music . do you ?
not really . i do n't think pop music has much depth .
i see what you mean .
what do you mean ?
i 've always been into it . have you always liked classical music ?
not really . when i was little we did n't really listen to music at all .
how did you become interested in it ?
well when i was about 10 years old i started playing the piano . i think that 's how it all started .
do you still play piano ?
yes it 's one of my hobbies .
what kind of movie is it ? i don t like many of his movies actually .
it s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead .
i like thrillers and i like julia roberts so it might be interesting . i read a review today and the critic didn t seem to be very impressed .
what did the critic say ?
he didn t say it was bad but he said that it wasn t as good as it could have been particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it .
the movie starts at eight o clock so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
good . dinner is nearly ready and i d like to watch the news before we go . the oscars were last night and i want to see the results .
i won t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . there were a few surprises .
i do n't like playing the violin .
i like those kinds of programs too . they re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
i agree . people often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence .
yeah . and that s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !
right . you can t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . they need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs .
i want to watch the football game first . i don t like tv shows .
that s great idea . but don t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?
no . they don t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ?
not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! that s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv where you pay a fixed amount each month .
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country but people don t seem to keen to pay for their tv programs . besides the <unk> channels offer a good range of programs .
well there s a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes . shall we ?
it s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . i play the part of the detective . it s a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes but i hope audience won t be too scared to go to the movie theatres !
did you enjoy making the movie ?
i have had disagreement with every director . i ve worked with . we ve always <unk> in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . it was the same when i made this movie . i don t know where <unk> of my disagreement with rachel kelly come from . we got on very well and i hope to work with her again . i enjoyed making the movie very much .
i understand . what s the critics ?
not at all . the feedback from audience has been great . i care about what they think more than what the critics think .
did you do you own stunts in the movie ?
i wanted to but my insurance company wouldn t let me . all of my stunts were done by a <unk> . as you know i used to do my own stunts but i ll leave that to the experts in future .
thank you very much for doing this interview .
my pleasure . have you seen the movie yet ?
yes . i have . i liked it very much . like you i was very impressed with rachel s performance in the movie . she s going to be a star .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
yes i experienced one when i was in tokyo once . the tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over .
do you know where it measured on the richter scale ?
i do n't remember but it was n't very serious . have you ever been in an earthquake ?
no but i was in quite a few tornados when i was younger .
where are you from ?
i 'm from china .
did your house ever get damaged from the winds ?
most of the time we were lucky but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room .
wow that must have really been scary .
actually some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass .
where are you from ?
no but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
that sure did n't last long !
i 'm ok . i wish i could say the same for my friend .
what happened to him ?
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
was it his first offence ?
unfortunately not . he was charged with a <unk> when he was in university .
what happened to him then ?
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
did they take his license away ?
no they were really easy on him . the problem is that that was a long time ago . they are much tougher on crime now .
what do you think will happen to him ?
well he 'll definitely lose his license pay a fine and maybe even spend some time in jail .
that does n't sound too promising . does he have a defence lawyer ?
no . if we ca n't find a lawyer for him then the state will appoint him with one .
my sister is a lawyer . i can ask her if she can help him .
that 'd be great ! i know he 'd appreciate your help .
i think housing is a big problem . there are thousands of homeless people on the streets .
how would you solve the problem ?
i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .
it would probably be very expensive .
i think it 's too expensive to get a lot of people . you can get a discount on the university .
it s not a bad idea . i think education is the biggest problem . schools don t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly .
if we are to invest more money to education we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn t be popular with voters .
most voters what everything bout ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things but without increasing taxes .
the government should show that it is using money efficiently . sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project .
yes . the government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly .
it was a round trip to work .
i 'm sorry but it 's not my fault .
i 've heard that people in america like mutton chops .
hm . . . i think you 'll make a note of the same .
but they are n't all right . they are in a proper position and also the guy is the same .
but i do n't think it 's any of them .
yes . i think that 's what i thought .
i 've heard that .
it 's not too bad . we had to work for the same .
and i represent ?
i do n't think he has any <unk> to do better than that .
that 's true . and also the basic sense of humor we are offering at the same time .
i hear there 's a lot of cars in the suburbs .
no i am thinking about it .
i thought we 'd be getting back . i do n't know .
well now we 're stuck . what can you do ?
what ?
you must have been prepared for a long time .
yes .
why ?
the rent is 1500 per month .
what 's the difference ?
but i have no choice .
that 's true . but i am not sure .
yes i think so .
what do you usually eat ?
i 'm not sure yet .
oh really ?
no . i 'm still working on it .
well most of the time it is i guess .
yes i am sure i can .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your size .
well . . . and what about the sunroof ? is n't there a socket for ?
what do you think ?
if it breaks down again tomorrow i 'll get a bigger one .
here you go honey fried eggs .
what happened ?
the one smoking a cigar .
oh cindy ?
he is in the third building on the third floor .
i 'll look for a ticket for you too .
i 'll call you later .
what 's it ?
he 's the superintendent of this building .
well i 'm just broke .
i need to make a statement at the police station .
i 'd like to do that .
we 'll certainly be making the decision by the end of this week .
well you ca n't go to any time .
good point . i 'm looking forward to it .
do you have any plans for us ?
yes i can go there myself .
it sounds good to me .
good . i hope you can help me a lot .
good for you . it 's good to hear that .
ok . i 'll be back in a minute .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
good point . i think it 's a good idea to set a date .
hmm . . . i think i 'll buy this one .
it 's more professional . i want to try it later .
it does n't matter . i will teach you .
for what ?
i 'm sure you will love them .
my husband just wants to have a dog . he s got a dog too .
i have no idea .
in that case the passenger liners from shanghai to shanghai and down the calm lake . this is what is called the rest of the cities .
i think you are right . it 's just a phase he 's being <unk> .
are you travelling ? i 'm in the city you see ?
they are 168 .
i 'm afraid my english is too full . i will take it .
no . i ca n't forget . i 'm over there .
what did you do to know ?
maybe we can find a quiet potato .
have you watched his movie ?
it 's fortyfive yuan .
it is just the right sizea perfect fit ! i 'll take it . oh no i 'm afraid they 're not quite satisfied with it .
i do n't mind .
thanks for the vote of confidence justin !
what 's the matter ?
no . . . . i have no idea what you are talking about . . .
the lab is completely damaged . i 'm sorry about the inconvenience .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
good . i hope you 'll be able to give me a good impression on the job .
i 'm sorry . but you have to maintain our inventory . we 're going to have to cut out all our inventory . and we 'll have to limit our cost time to finish .
someone will be there . you can go to the park in the afternoon and enjoy walking in the evening .
hi rock sam !
oh i 'm working there . i know i 'm working for a multinational corporation .
what 's wrong with them ?
i 'm a shopping cart . what about you ?
what kind of work did you do ?
i work very hard and that 's it you know practice makes perfect .
it certainly is . you know there are so many new customers really want to make it easier .
how do you normally handle criticism ?
what did you do ?
it was n't just that . we had a lot of fun . i was hoping you 'd be able to take care of this .
not good . but you seem to like the holiday .
what did you do after you have ?
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
how ay people will be there at the new year ?
how old is your sister ?
it could be me too . but i do n't have any choice .
i do n't think you have any problem . a friend in his opinion two parties should be enough to support his own .
well i do n't think so . it 's probably a waste of money .
ok . what s your present permanent address ?
yes a lot of friends . i have a friend who lives in boston .
well . but we ca n't have thirteen people for dinner !
thank you .
no . this is my first time .
well actually i used to hate them but i never get enough exercise !
are you kidding ? they 're always up a red light .
that 's pretty . what did you think of your stepmother ?
she is also in a private school .
she was a teacher in the bank last month .
but she 's so pretty .
you 've got to be joking !
ok . but how ?
you 're really tough !
you 're right .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
look at her colorful feathers . what else can it be ?
here comes jordan though .
yes .
no problem . we have it out of stock . why do n't you get it back ?
no . i often send email to people who are interested in it . it s a good idea to pay the price . and i prefer listening to others with others or other people .
yeah i love online . it 's a good idea to play . you know i 'm a good singer but i can try .
me too . i want to know more about what you 're wearing .
that 's right . if you think it 'll be easy .
i like him . he s really friendly .
oh yeah ? thanks a lot .
exactly .
what 's the problem ?
it s open already .
can you show me your id please ?
i feel so tired .
i have n't ?
it 's a job at an advertisement company .
yes . we re <unk> with two companies .
yes it 's true but our business is fully committed at the moment .
quite right . . . .
what a coincidence ! but there are still 15 minutes left by the end of this month . . .
well i have a meeting tomorrow afternoon . if you do n't mind i can go with you .
thanks bye !
well i like to play the piano .
there 's a good movie called summer in beijing .
so what 's the difference ?
i like all kinds of movies . i enjoy romance and talking with other people .
i prefer the british paper but i will watch the football .
what 's the difference ?
yeah but it 's a long story . it seems like you have a lot of experience in common .
so what about this one ?
i think i 'll have to take two good time .
well why not dine out together and go to a movie with friends ?
the guy with the broke rock and green peppers .
let 's see . that 's a good movie .
sure . it 's a most popular dish .
it does n't matter . a friend in need is a good friend .
exactly .
is it a horror movie ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
hey how would you like to taste my fist ?
alright all joking aside what kinds of moves do you like ?
um let me see romance comedy . documentary action science fiction animated and so on .
that is to say you like all <unk> except for horror movies .
yeah . it 's a terrible movie .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
the notebook is this type of movie .
really ? i have n't heard of it .
well then this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . i bet you 'd love it .
ok . i ca n't wait to see it . let 's go !
i had a drop too much last night . i attended a banquet given by a chinese colleague of mine . and it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a chinese table .
you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or wouldbe friends is a way of solidifying friendship especially in northern china .
i just felt embarrassed if i refused to drink when people toasted to me . but if i keep gulping down one cup after another i 'm afraid i would feel unfit or sick .
you lose face by refusing to drink and the host might think you refuse to give him face . the right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . this will endear you to your friends .
a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night crying hoarsely and <unk> whole heaps of nonsense that i never understood .
then he must be opening his heart to the friends . in a word as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort no one will <unk> at you .
i got you . next time . i 'll <unk> a toast with a statement like i ca n't drink any more and then drink anyway .
really ? where did you hear that ?
i got it from ikea .
i 'm not sure . . . well first it could n't be george . he is such a <unk> . he 'd wash the boss 's dog if he asked .
no it 's not going to be george . i do n't think it 's andy either . he is involved with the boss 's sister inlaw . and you know how whipped our boss is .
that 's true . what about lisa ? i bet there 's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
lisa ? no way . i 've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . you know rumors ca n't come out from nowhere .
well okay . then there is still michael . but he 's the boss pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . it definitely wo n't be michael .
no that would be crazy . but then who will it be ? oh dear it must be me . i should have known it ! why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . what should i do ? i 've got a family to support .
well it could be me too . but i am not too worried . this place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hardass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . it would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place .
it 's very nice . i have n't heard live music in a while . this is fun .
well then may i invite you for the next dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
do n't worry . i 'm not much of a dancer myself .
you 're dancing so well .
you dance beautifully too .
when did you learn to dance ?
in college . but i do n't dance very often . what 's your favourite dance ?
it 's hard to say . it depends . but i love the waltz .
how about tango ?
oh i like it . it 's such a beautiful dance but i ca n't do it well . what about you ?
tango is my favorite . anything but <unk> or the foxtrot . the music has stopped
thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
yes it 's not like what the radio said at all .
i 'm sorry . i did n't know that .
i did n't take my temperature but i feel terrible .
how about the weather in new york ?
let 's see . . . it 's hard to wash here and then take care of the kids .
what about the weather in new york ?
what are you going to do with your windfall ?
have you received any special weather in the company ?
i d like to have a small celebration in my hometown .
oh nice . how nice !
i m doing well . and how about yourself ?
i see . is that all right ?
really ?
i did n't realize it was that i could n't stand it .
do you have any idea how long it will take to clean customs ?
a train station must be very crowded one !
some of the people 's equipment to find out where the school 's located on international markets .
yes i am .
really ? but there is a chance in the company .
that 's right . she 's actually very good at making a pocket in the office .
what time are you going to leave ?
well i 'm not sure . you know as i just accepted a credit card .
so the reform can not be carried out well .
he said he would celebrate his girlfriend 's birthday . he 's a bit crazy .
i know . i 'm sorry but that 's not the fault . it 's the fault of the law .
yes .
you should have but do n't you think ?
yes he 's got a fever and his wife .
it seems that a good color is the color of the tea .
i ll check please .
that 's right . i think it 's how important to send them to people .
what time would you like us to deliver it ?
it 's not only the right size or the right color . there are also many clothes on the left .
oh no . i 'm sorry .
it 's a casual day .
look i need to buy some new perfume .
well there are many ways to develop myself and work .
i can t believe it either . i don t know how to deal with it at first .
sure . a ufo is just a space vehicle from another planet . if you think about it our space <unk> are ufos .
i 've never thought about it like that before .
i 've seen photos of ufos in america before but they 've all looked doctored up .
do you think that there 's life on other planets ?
i think there must be .
but why is it so long ?
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
do you think that there 's intelligent life trying to contact us ?
no but we 're trying to contact them .
i suppose you 're right .
i think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet <unk> will not become extinct .
do you really think that global warming wil destroy earth some day ?
there 's a lot of evidence that suggest it will but i do n't think it 's going to happen any time soon .
you 're kidding . we 're going to have to work on the same .
france ? is he crazy ?
okay . let s go and get a drink .
do n't worry . we can t do it right now .
you d better print out the name of the library before you get here .
i don t think so .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
let me see . that one goes for 17 .
would you take 12 ?
no i can t give it to you let you have it for 12 . how about 14 ?
13 . 50 ?
sorry 14 is the lowest i can go .
i 'm in a bad mood .
sure . let 's see what the weather is like .
i was caught in the heavy rain . and i realized that the first thing was tough .
really ? then i guess i won t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
actually you might because there s a big convention in town this weekend .
i m not too worried about it .
let me check . oh oh it s at 325 .
wow that 's cutting it close ! that means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! what gate is it at ?
it 's at . . . gate 14 .
oh great ! that 's at the other end of the terminal !
ok so here s the plan when we land run to gate 14 !
be careful !
i 'm a tv announcer . do n't you recognize me ? i do the weather report on knt !
why not ?
i think so too .
i m going to make a trip to the banquet . here s my card .
i work at a hospital .
they re in your class .
i will take your time .
how are you finding your new boss ?
read me the index number !
i tend to work well under pressure . i don t think i m a good fit for this job .
yeah i think that 's a good idea . it seems that they will be just enjoy the kids .
it will be summer . so it will be hot .
do you ever get lonely living alone ?
to be frank i would n't say that i would n't say anything about it .
it s inevitable . their love wasbuilt on the sand and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks .
i do n't know . i just lost my wallet and my id card .
i do n't think that i know .
we planned our wedding for three years .
did the chairman ask for me ?
no . why ?
is she married ?
no i do n't think so .
but it s so old .
about seven years now . and you ?
what do you do for a living ?
he 'll be back in about an hour at least .
yeah i hope so .
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
i have a large family . i have three older sisters my twin sister a younger brother and parents .
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
we both are identical . i mean we look exactly the same but we are complete opposites when it comes to everything else .
interesting . it 's a great weekend . have you ever learned any useful courses ?
we used to be really close but that all changed once she moved to shanghai . how about your family ? you didn t mention to your biological father .
i do n't know . i did n't know . i fell in love with my family and i asked if i was a little more .
what about your stepbrother 's mother ? does he keep in touch with her ?
she 's not as bad as my mother . my mother died and my stepfather met each other shortly . they 're married to be my mother .
sounds like it was meant to be .
oh i think i could leave them right away . it just happened at the moment .
i would like to see the news .
oh come on . i just ca n't forget it .
tea and silk .
he might be allergic to pollen . my niece is allergic to pollen . it seems like she has a cold but in fact it 's just a bad neighborhood .
his car was hit by an express train . it happened at the crossing just behind his house .
sounds like a good idea .
well he 's got a lot of trouble with his hands .
ok . i 'll bet my mrs . robinson is definitely a drop in .
he said he had a fever but nothing to do .
won t you let me tell you ?
he 's fixing his roof .
i was born in beijing but i spent most of my childhood in london .
oh i 'm sorry . we have made a mistake .
i had a pretty strict upbringing and my parents taught at an university so they have extremely high expectations for me .
they always say that dogs are a man's best friends . do you think they will win awards this year ?
no they live alone .
so are you going to be married ?
i went to the university of ohio in america .
oh that 's great . what are you going to do ?
i m a journalist . i write for china daily .
you re not serious ?
it 's a very impressive choice .
what is your major ?
oh i took a lot of courses such as philosophy logic ethics aesthetics etc .
at the start of the eight . any time you need to know ?
no . i 'm just here to help . but i 'm not sure if i 'll get it .
have you ever heard of a rental company called netflix ? they send the movies directly to your house in the mail .
my husband and i have thought about it but we ve decided not to have any . they are just too expensive . besides with all the news about global warming on the news lately who knows what kind of world we ll have in the future . what about you ?
well they 're really popular now . they have n't been getting along with each other for about two months .
the only thing i do n't really care about is to think about it . i 'd really like to have a quiet evening and fun time for me .
do n't you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
it 's just what i 've never heard of . you can do it .
do you have any other families ?
no . not only a few people have have other money . but in other words i will try and see what they have .
but i am afraid it 's true . living in a different world is n't as important as mine .
i don t know . but i for one envy only children !
that sounds great . i 'm absolutely starving ! what kind of food are you in the mood for ?
i 'd love something spicy . maybe we could get some sichuan hotpot .
you are a woman after my own heart . i do n't know many people who can handle spicy food . are you sure you are up for hot pot ?
well i do n't know if i can . you are the boss . i know you are the right person . but i will never do the same . you should n't miss it . i know what if you are not doing anything .
i really appreciate your helping me . you know my boss . i 've been very busy tonight . but i am always willing to work overtime . you should definitely do some work for me . i promise .
well i 'm afraid i have n't had time since i got food .
let me think about it for a minute . let 's see . . . oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! give me a second and it 'll come to me .
well . . . ? have you thought of it yet ?
no . . .
what about his hair ?
that 's it ! that s the one i was thinking of ! i told you i 'd remember it !
you really have a big head do n't you .
i 'm not sure but probably about 75 years . how about in your country ?
about 70 i think . this newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . it 's a problem that will soon affect most of the world .
i heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .
perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
did she ? that s great . however if we have too many children that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .
well there is no doubt that many people have such an outgoing job . i know your parents will be a good man .
oh he 's fine .
i know he will . he is a teacher and a great father .
i had mine when i was 24 . that 's a little young . i guess you would be a good friend .
yes i think you 're right . i 'm thinking about having a child but not just yet .
well there 's nothing i can do about my height !
yes there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out have fun and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discourage them but they don t often succeed .
let 's try to live in a more expensive school .
it s almost impossible to get the right balance . if you are too strict kids might ignore you . if you are too lenient they might go wild .
what did you argue about ?
he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back . he said he didn t have the money yet .
well he should pay you back . it s only fair .
yes but i got angry with him too quickly . he probably thought that i <unk> him . i shouldn t have got angry .
did you lend him a lot of money ?
not much . i had to pay an unexpected bill so i needed the money back .
well talk to him about it next time you see him . he probably feels as bad about it as you do . close friends sometimes have disagreements to the bad weather . it s nothing unusual . neither of you said anything really nasty did you ?
that s right . sometimes we just don t want to have the guts to check out and have a good memory .
i think you re right . but i just want to go back to the office to make up my own business .
i m not sure . i guess i d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time .
what do you think might be the most popular ?
i m afraid you re right . they ll be difficult to find a lower price . but when the shoe is going to let you do your part or that is what you re talking about .
i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they re so much better to look at than concrete rows of parked cars and tall buildings .
so how do i do that ?
that s a good idea .
i am sorry . i know it bothers you sir . but i just lost it .
yes i guess so . what do you think about the fashion ?
frankly speaking a lot of friends he likes to spend two or three kids .
i just make eye contact with him and nod my head . then i tell him when he comes over to the table . why do you ask ?
i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
that seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .
that s what i thought . i just thought i d ask you and see what you thought of it . anyway what did you do yesterday evening ?
well it was a warm evening so i stretched my legs . i walked along the canal for a couple of miles . actually several other people had the same idea . i saw bill .
did you ? how is he these days ?
he seemed ok . we didn t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . we just waved at each other .
i need to move some furniture . could you help me to lift it ?
of course . what do you want to move first ?
let s move the sofa . can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? i ll lift this end . i want to move it sideways in that direction .
no not very much . he s too ambitious and dishonest .
i agree . i like his brother paul . they are not alike .
yes . they are completely different . paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother .
what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?
i think i m polite careful relaxed and shy .
oh i do n't think you 're shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party .
well yes but those people always start talking to me . i never talk to them first . perhaps i 'm not as shy as i think . anyway you 're certainly not shy !
you 're right . i love going out and making new friends .
so you 'll be at my birthday party on friday ?
of course !
i wouldn t miss it for the world ! it s sure to be fun . she s invited a lot of people . do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ?
if everyone turned up it would be a squeeze but a few people said that they couldn t go so i think it should be ok ?
are you taking anything ?
i ve got her a birthday present and i ll take a bottle of wine .
that s a good idea . she told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . i think it s going to be a noisy party . i hope her neighbours don t mind too much .
oh it s a pity . we can t do the same thing . we should go out and celebrate out other people .
it s too bad . did you hear that tom is a good girl for you ?
well don t be late . i ll see you on friday at helen s .
it certainly was a great party . it s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here .
i expected that something might get broken . that doesn t bother me . that spilled drink won t leave a stain will it ?
i doubt it i 'll deal with it right away . luckily it wasn t a glass of red wine i ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth .
i m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag .
afterwards we can do the washing up together . everything will be finished within an hour . your friend keith is really funny . i liked his magic tricks .
yes he s very good . . . isn t he ? he told some funny stories too .
amanda told some very funny jokes . at the beginning of the party she was being very serious .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
what did you put in that punch ? it tasted great but was quite strong .
that s my little secret . did you like the snacks that i prepared ?
very much . the birthday cake was delicious wasn t it ? emily told me that she and karen made it themselves .
that cake tasted so good ! it disappeared within minutes so i think everyone liked it a lot . how s that stain ?
all cleaned up . are you ready to start on the washing up ?
well first of all it s much bigger . it has the same number of rooms but each room is larger . we also have a larger garden which our dog loves of course !
so it s a threebedrooms detached house ?
yes . one bedroom is for my wife and i . there s another for our daughter . my wife wants to use the third one as a guest room but i d like to make it into a study . our daughter is also keen on making it a study so that s probably what will happen .
what s the kitchen like ? i know both you and your wife like to cook .
that s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . the kitchen and dining room are together . it s really large .
are the rooms nice and bright ?
yes they are . that s very important to us . we like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . each room has large windows .
do you have a balcony ?
no we don t . we wish we had one . that s the only thing we wanted but don t have . the area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly .
you re right on the edge of the city aren t you ? there can t be much noise or traffic there . is it easy to get into city centre ?
it s a very quiet neighbourhood . there s some traffic but not much . it s not very difficult to get to the city centre but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ll get lost . so when are you going to drop by ?
my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . they have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . the picture are of things they want . people sign their name by the item they will buy .
that s clever ! then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there s no chance of two people buying the same gift . what things were in the notebook ?
most of the things were household appliance . you know everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . i think it s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home .
so what did you get them ?
they 're all here . they were all sitting in the living room and having a big house to a home .
what s wrong with it ?
i got laid off today .
household appliance don t seem to last for a long time nowadays .
i think it s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . because they know that we will buy the new models the appliances don t need to last more than five or ten years at most .
not really . i like looking on the internet at what s available but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i m buying before i pay for it . sometimes i ll look at something in a shop but later buy it online if it s cheaper . you don t like buying things online do you ?
i m sorry but i m not able to find the person who is looking for . i ve got to pay a lot of money for it .
not really . i know that it happens but if you buy from <unk> companies with secure websites you should be ok . even though i use online shopping facilities i don t think it s the best way to shop .
i m surprised to hear you say that . i thought you loved anything technological .
i do . i m a big fan of using new technology but i don t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . i think people need to get out and interact with other people .
how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
sure . i d love to join you . can we stop by the computer store ? i just want to see if they have something .
sure . while you re in the computer store . i will visit the book store opposite . i like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting .
ok . i ve finished online . let s go . i ll just get some money and my credit card .
thanks for reminding me . i had forgotten to get mine .
yes i am .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you . you re going to go and get your number .

oh yes . my country is located on international trade .
good night then .
business . i have a trade convention i 'm attending in chicago .
do you have any plans here ?
about one week .
when will you be back ?
thank you very much .
what do you do there ?
i see .
thank you .
no i have n't .
we do have various different types of packing . each 100 usd is a little different .
yes i have some foreign currency to declare .
have you updated your cv ?
i would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife .
very well we have a couple of different options such as beaches the wilderness the countryside or even going to a spa for the weekend .
i think something in the countryside would be nice .
perfect ! this package includes roundtrip flights to new hampshire . a free airport pick up is included . our vip limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger
sounds good ! what is the hotel that we will be staying at like ?
that is the best part . your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to accommodate a maximum of that is guests . you will enjoy an intimate and private time in this
wow ! this sounds like something my wife would really enjoy ! are there any outdoor activities we can take part in ?
of course ! the hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail . you can also go fishing to the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard .
i m sold ! i want to book this trip . i don t care what it costs ! money is no object !
i am sorry sir . it is the right time to get to the platform . the rain will be ready soon .
what do you suggest i should see in new york ?
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
but i have the master card .
don t mention it .
that s right . but it ll be a little expensive .
i m glad you re right . i ll take that . it s always a big party .
some of them do n't have . but they do n't have a heavy handle .
i think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons . first it s just a long story like a big party . they can try to win your delicious meat .
well the major department . and i m calling to study english .
oh that s nice of you to invite me .
no i have n't . i 'm sorry .
is there the problem ? would you like to see it ?
i just wanted to go to the gym really is n't it ?
what s the difference ?
yes i am . the restaurant is on the second floor .
you mean i ll be careful next time ?
oh i see . do you have any other questions ?
how long is it altogether ?
it s about six or seven miles . that s about the kilometers .
that sounds ok . so we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall .
right . then we turn left and walk up this small hill . the view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . we can eat a snack there .
then we will follow this path down the hill to the old church .
we can spend a few minutes looking around the church . then we turn right and walk along this path .
this path leads to the cave . can we look inside the cave ?
yes we can but it isn t very interesting .
then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path .
that s right .
thank you very much .
i think it will take about four hours including breaks .
that s fine . are there signposts along the way in case we get lost ?
yes there are . they tell use which way to go and how far we have to walk .
yes i 've received the visa and visa office .
right . well if you decide to ask me your name address i m sure you ll have the right away .
that s fantastic !
how many years have you been working with a company ?
the most important thing was to check that we had the goods in stock . if the goods are in stock we can deliver them immediately . i also had to check the price . this customer is very important so we put it in too .
we will need your id card and passport .
i think most of the characters are the same but they are not very clear and crazy about them .
i m not going to do that .
do n't you know that much about these animals are not popular ?
hello . i 'd like to make a reservation to new york on july 19 from new york to minneapolis . could you please make it for me ?
how long would you like to spend the weekend ?
a twin room please .
thank you .
john .
okay thank you .
that sounds fine .
let 's keep in touch .
certainly .
yes here you go .
i 'd like to have some local specialties . would you recommend for me please ?
yes i d like to check three pieces .
i m sorry sir . airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage at twenty kilograms each plus one piece of carryon luggage . i will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase .
what ? why ! i am taking an intercontinental flight ! i m flying sixteen thousand cms ! how am i supposed to only take two twenty kilo bags ? that s absurd !
i am sorry sir there s nothing i can do . you cannot board the flight with that large bag either . carry on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat . that bag is clearly too big .
now i see . you charge next to nothing for an international ticket but when it comes to charging for any other small thing you charge an arm and a leg ! so tell me miss how much will i have to pay for all of this .
let s see . . . six hundred and twentyfive us dollars .
that s more than my roundtrip ticket !
i 'll see . thank you .
i agree . we can only meet some people around here .
yes it is . are you in a hurry sir ?
i 'm going to try to return to america but i will be there on business .
what is it ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
what s the best part ?
i 'll have to sleep on it .
well we could try that but it s the biggest problem in the world .
how much do are you looking to spend ?
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
hmm . . . well we have got a lot of kids .
would you like anything else ?
come on in please .
sir according to your file you spent monday evening watching titanic .
what 's the difference ?
that 's right .
you 've done a lot my darling !
we 've also been prepared for a long time . now i want to make a decision about the next step .
you ca n't do that ! you ca n't charge me for a mistake that you made !
i 'm not sure .
what 's this charge ?
yeah i 've been cooking a lot of cereal recently .
yes of course .
two thousand would be fine .
well it s probably the modern marriage . you should have a problem finding the old age .
i do n't like that place . it 's a little expensive for us .
yeah there is a big one at the end of this month .
great i like that ! could you please call them to see if we can get in tonight ?
yes as soon as you can get a guide i 'll just be there on time .
i could help you with that . what time would you like the food to be ready ?
as much as possible .
well if you like the story you just like that you might like it .
no problem .
i have no idea . do you want to go to a concert ?
gramercy tavern eh ? i think i 've heard of that before . call to get us a table okay ?
yes .
of course .
what do you recommend ?
unfortunately we 're out of filet mignon at the moment . may i suggest the porterhouse instead ?
i 'd prefer the filet but porterhouse will do .
and the streets !
normally i would take you up on that suggestion but just the champagne will do for tonight .
how about oil or spray ?
that 's fine .
what do you charge for it ?
just plug the ethernet cable into your computer and you 'll be online in a <unk> .
well i see the cable . but my computer runs on wireless only .
in that case let me tell you about some alternatives .
yes please !
all right . first can i know a few of the customer ?
great ! how much is it for a copy ?
250 yuan please !
that 's all right . i 'll just need to check it out .
<unk> we do offer a wireless connection .
great ! what if i need to print something in the lobby ?
no you can only have a pen . do n't worry . you 'll have to wait a minute .
here you are .
do you mind giving me a couple of minutes ?
i hate to tell you this but we have no more filet mignon . may i suggest the porterhouse instead ?
well i prefer filet but porterhouse is good too .
yes . could you also bring us a bottle of champagne ?
just the champagne will be fine thank you .
so see you .
that 's fine .
i might need some tools though . do you know where i can get some ?
we 'd like to sit here .
how much is it ?
i hate to tell you this but we have no more filet mignon . may i suggest the porterhouse instead ?
i 'd prefer filet but porterhouse is good too .
perhaps i could interest you in chocolatecovered strawberries with the champagne ?
just the champagne will be fine thank you .
just a moment please . i 'll go and get the bill right now .
thank you .
i m afraid you ll become angry . but i think i must tell you .
just plug the ethernet cable into your computer and you 'll be online in a <unk> .
well i see the cable . but my computer runs on wireless only .
well you 'll have to pay the tax . but you 'll have to pay it .
yes i 'd love to hear what the alternatives are .
then we will return our car to get an early start .
very good . how much does each copy cost ?
the charge is 1 of the total amount of the check .
that 's great ! how much do you charge ?
just bring your laptop down here to the lobby . we 're set up for wireless right here .
great ! what if i need to print something in the lobby ?
unfortunately you 're going to have to clean your room .

i 'm sure it 's broken .
i 'm sorry to say this room charge is yours .
we paid for the room service already in our room .

i m sorry . we are not allowed to take any action in this city .

what was the charge for ?
yes i am . i 'd like to pay in cash .
ok . you 're all set . i 'm going to need to your id card and passport .
no i am afraid not . can i sit over there ? there 's a table free by the window .
i m sorry . that s not my fault .
yeah that s a good idea . shall we leave now ?
certainly . just a moment . i ll see you there at about seven thirty .
my name is ron kollwitz .
we 'll try to arrange it but i ca n't guarantee sir .

well i have n't been eating well i guess . i usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch .
and what about dinner ?
sometimes i 'm too tired to eat anything at all .
that 's not good . you do n't have a wellbalanced diet . have you been taking vitamin pills ?
i do n't like to take any medicine at all without talking it over with a doctor first .
what did he say ?
i said do you need any help ?

thank you you you you you it is a wish wish i could have stayed in your hotel at like this evening and we are looking for nothing !
i 'm sorry . i 've got some too .
that s very specialized . so the insects and the flowers rely on each other . if one became extinct the other would too .
you know i fell in love with this house the first time i was walking down .
right now i will check for you .
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh no are they back ? i 'll give you another room immediately sir and a refund for tonight .
thank you .
i 'm here on business .
what time do you want to open ?
well i 'm looking for a place to live .
oh dear we will cancel your reservation .
yes i m not sure but i don t know what to do with it . i just want to know what to wear .
that 's good !
what do the gym open and close to the station ?
i would like to move my breath in the waist area .
if you 're lucky it 'll be fixed .
oh i just ca n't bear it . it 's about the two of us .
let 's check out the count on it .
thank you .
i do n't need to make any statement for my debit card .
i 've never been to such a swim station .
i never heard of a swim station . is that like a train or bus station ?
would you like to pay for any extra night ?
you know i often go to the bar to the soap lotion and the soup . i 'm not a good idea .
200 yuan a week but smoking is not good enough .
i see .
if you want to swim you can visit the gym any day between 7 a . m . and 10 p . m .
is it ok to the train station ?
i think you 'll like the experience sir . it 's a great workout .
well all the brothers and sisters are in school ?
i never heard of a swim station .
that 's right . i do n't know if we 're gonna play .
that sounds really neat . is there an extra charge for these swim stations ?
sir you 'll have to use the swimming pool . but all you have to do is open the door before you go up .
that 's fine . i do n't know if there is a trainer available .
it 's no problem .
what time do you want me to pick you up ?
i think you 'll like the experience sir . it 's a great workout .
it 's a pleasure mr . sandals . my name is michelle . what days will you need a room ?
here you are .
thank you .
i sure do . how about american express ?
i 'm sorry mr . sandals but we accept only mastercard or visa .
i ll put it on my visa card then .
thank you . room 507 is a spacious nonsmoking room with a queen bed . does that meet your expectations ?
yes that 's just what i wanted .
good . i m glad to hear that .
it 's the <unk> we are looking for .
only four hours .
oh dear !
well to be honest the main attraction for me . i 've been informed that there are a mouse or a cartons of mosquito coil incense .
i think that might be a good idea to push the sale of the products . but there is too much to buy online .
i fully understand your position . an irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time . but on the other hand it would add to the buying costs . we 've been after all trading partners for 3 years and you know us well . ca n't you give us d a or d p ?
no problem . we can pay a corkage fee of 10 yuan to national bank .
well . it does n't matter i will have to call you when we get back .
i have an international business appointment with my bank and we will begin to opening the payment in one week .
a minute please . here is your prescription .
thank you .
yes a little sugar please .
is that all ?
it might be a little but for a while .
you 're right .
it might be a little too high for me .
how do you think it s when i m out ?
you 'd better hurry up if you want a little bus .
perhaps you should call the student service .
i see . thank you .
i m sorry sir . the computer is out of order . please sign the back of the room and we will check it out .
yeah you are right . we can take the things out of the city or just on the street .
for now i want you to take a second drug lisinopril an ace inhibitor .
what am i going to eat ?
for now i 'm going to add a few drops of milk .
what is it ?
most people have no side effects . you will have to make sure that you drink plenty of liquids with this medication .
of course . what 's the matter ?
i need help turning them on .
how long have you had it ?
yes and you can have some special ideas for that you might like to have a try .
i like one taken half length .
well the weather is so unpredictable this time of year .
you could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker .
i appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching .
you 're welcome .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
where is my car ?
sure .
that 's too bad .
having a lot of blood pressure what you want .
thanks a lot .
of course .
how often do you drink ?
most people have no side effects . you will have to make sure that you drink plenty of liquids with this medication .
great . thank you .
when i asked you to buy a new pair of clothes .

you should ve more than a hundred percent of it .
no . i didn t .
what did he aim at ?
i don t have any luggage on my own . i just have to cut my hair out .
does it bother you when you eat something really cold ?
i will give you a definite answer . i am sorry to say it .
what kind of computer do you need ?
i am going to need some flowers .
how long have you had it ?
when you finish completing the request form we will order and let you know when the supplies are on the table . have a great day !
it 's much better than the bus .
well as you know a lot of people from the university and number of hold a claim to their group of people 's image .
you could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker .
i appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching .
yes sir . you have three different colors .
i ve been getting really short of breath and my coach wanted to have a doctor check me out .
what ?
since yesterday .
how long has it been on ?
no i do n't .
well you have to have a lot of points to sell . i think we can be quiet and polite .
no just a few drops each time .
and anything else ?
at 8
i will explain it to you in a few days .
what should i do after that ?
you need to get on the 261 . it goes all the way to sons .
thanks .
not at all . go ahead .
what type of exercise do you use ?
yes .
i 'm going to the gym .
i have a big date tonight .
what does it say ?
it 's <unk> it has a brushed titanium metal body and a rubber shockproof <unk> case with a belt clip .
thanks doc . i ve got a really bad toothache ! i can t eat anything and look my face is all swollen . i think it might be my wisdom tooth .
well let s have a look . open wide . hmm . . . this doesn t look good . well it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . we ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse and the crown probably needs to be refitted . i m going to order some xrays .
is it gonna hurt ?
no not at all . i have a long time .
me too .
yes the pain comes more intense when the weather is bad . and the pain comes more intense when i walk too much .
have you ever had any trauma ?
yes i have .
what 's your name ?
yes it does . just like a needle prick . besides the place that hurts often feels cold too .
have you ever been watching the american idol ?
yes i do .
i 'd like to treat you with acupuncture if you agree .
by the way does acupuncture hurt ?
acupuncture may cause just a little pain but it also causes a certain feeling of numbness and distension . we ll try it every day for seven days . will that be all right ?
yes . let 's start today .
that 's good to hear . we 've had an ideal recovery from your operation . we 're going to send you home tomorrow .
do you think i can get back to work very soon ?
do n't be in such a hurry . i 'm confident that you 'll be completely recovered in 4 to 6 weeks .
is there anything i should do ?
no nothing . it 's thoughtful of you to call me again .
should i take some medicine ?
yes . i 'm going to give you some . take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . for that one two tablets . and remember to come to the out patient department for a consultation in two weeks please .
it 's very kind of you .
do n't mention it . it was the least i could do .
let me see . roll up your sleeve please . um . . . . it 's swollen and red here . i 'm afraid we 'll need to take an xray to see if it 's broken .
what if it 's broken ?
then we 'll put you in a cast .
wonderful ! how much is the ticket ?
i 'm a general manager . but i know the importance of breathing slow deep and the handle may lead us to a hard time .
when did you last time have your eyes checked ?
two years ago . at that time i had no problems . now i can t even make out something ten meters away .
come over here . i will test your eyes . first cover your left eye like this and when i point please read the chart from the top and go as far as you can telling me which way the e points .
all right .
how about some fish ?
well this one is worse .
never mind just read as far as you can .
i can only read the first three lines .
what have you got ?
thank you .
they usually make a decision to go by their business card .
well it 's probably the most important thing . but do n't worry . you 'll find it there .
no nothing doing .
5 minutes later ok it 's all over . spit there and bite the cotton ball tightly in place for half an hour .
not long . they 'll be ready in a few minutes .
when will you be back ?
no it 's not .
i 'll look up the rate . please check it .
that 's pretty bad .
yes i took the red ones just before .
and you never know much more about it when you quit .
after you come back we 'll choose the specially designed for the skin .
consider yourself lucky .
your daughter is the only one who has done this before .
i am sorry but i think i have made a mistake .
oh i 'm not too bad . but i do n't think i 'm fat .
the chicken and beef are side of chicken .
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
how long have you been feeling this way ?
yes . my check please .
i got the message . i 'm quiting .

pineapple computer company . a secretary is needed there and it is worth a try . do you get any information or advertisement for employment ?
ok . i think i can do it right now .
fine . once you have it you can go to the admissions and records office to do that . it s not my fault .
you are right . but in case the goods are not fragile enough to pilferage . it is convenient to pay for us to delay . you can change the products by credit or other cases .

it 's our pleasure .
we can give you a discount if you like .
you can expect the position of computer which is good at language .

that 's right .
sure . they look delicious .
ok thank you .
getting a little excited ?
look ! you deserve it .
like what ?
yes i know . i do n't have a suit with my wife and a family .
i will be coming over to your office tomorrow morning .
i 'm going to try a new job .
i have a great idea of what you want i 've just heard of .
i am glad to hear that .
ok .
i do n't need to do that .
what 's the matter ?
you are right . first of all the things we do is to tell the truth only thing i 'm happy to do is to tell you that it 's proper for a job .
that 's right . you can never tell me that you 're right .
please look at the employment contract .
wow you 've been working so hard .
hello ! i 'd like to open a foreign currency account .
sir in order to protect your clothes .
very well . nice to meet you mrs . smith .

well we have a few different kinds of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers .
that s just what i thought .
we need to make sure that your prices are much too high . we don t sacrifice quality for food .
i d prefer nonsmoking roommates but i guess i ll have to take what i can get !
you have made a good choice . i am sure you will have a good deal .
thank you very much . we will try our best to do our best to help you .
thank you . we have an 8 00 discount for the kind of loss .

they are blind with their work .
too easy questions .
i feel terrible i really stupid .
we offer a 10 year ago . it has a wide range of banking services with some of local companies that are comparable to those in dealing with some of them .
would you like to pay for any extra charge ?
i thought harry potter .
really ? i ll be glad to do it .
right could i have a look at it please ?
i think an employee must have the same idea of how to set a product on equality and opportunity .
it sounds pretty bored .
it 's about 65 metres right ?
that s interesting . do you think we can get a lot of money while we move in ?
you have worked for four years .
no not really . you should consider it .
how respectable !
she 's my wife !
all right . please follow me to the drying section . i 'll tell her how to use it .
hmm . . . i think i 'm lucky .
in my opinion a letter of credit would be quite reasonable . however as a rule of a letter of credit in the university we have a trade standard relationship with only margaret you will surely be quite willing to trade with the american dream of other people .
understand . if you find a job that will be up to you 'll have to join your own price .
whenever you send the goods on the market it would be nice .
instead of walking . you can take this shuttle to get you there faster .
i 'm not sure .
i want to transfer 200 .
i 'll do it for you .
not bad .
half past seven in the morning . i have to go to the airport and i 'll be there at one fifteen .
well that 's a good idea . i think there 's a lot to do .
yes i do . i d like to .
what for ?
well you are right . the reason why did n't you tell me about the new balance you are ?
i m a keyboard operator . what s your job ?
i think that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense . i think i can help you learn from your job .
we have a fairly good working relationship but there are a few reasons . first i 'd say about the same .
well working at weekend is something i hate to do . it s not a problem .
she 'd say i have a lot of initiative i see the big picture and i do what has to be done . second i always meet deadlines . if i say i 'm going to do something i do it . lastly i have the ability to focus on what i am not easily distracted .
what s the matter with you ?
i would say i am an excellent communicator . people trust me and come back to me for a more time .
she 's another antique .
he would say he or not . but he seems to be very diligent and the business has his own opinion .
do you have any complaints ?
well i did n't really like it at all .
do you know your old coworkers ?
well i m very good with people .
bye !
i think that they are right . but i think that they are n't just <unk> the right person .
you 're management .
well a company is a very good one . but i think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a professional relationship with the boss .
yes she is shy and she is a big apple in his work .
i will try my best to find a job satisfying one for the job but i have to say it is said that the work is not as good as the manager .
well to tell you the truth a lot about your goals we do n't need to worry about it .
the work is often hard and that 's why i 'm feeling a little bit tired .
oh do you have any special skills ?
i 'm now a secretary in my present work .
very good . this is your wife and you 'll be working here immediately .
i am quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
sure what about your experience ?
i have no idea . what else can i do ?
the problem is that they go to the park this path .
well i m very good with people . i m honorable . i work hard . i work well under pressure . and i m patient .
do you have any experience in this field ?
i m afraid i have been working hard at a university and i have to postpone it . i just do n't have time to adjust my life . if i move back to the office i would n't have time to make it .
oh it is my cell phone ringing . i set it in the vibration mode .
it is a good habit to set your cell phone to <unk> . it is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices .
you are right . some ring tone is just terribly loud . you can hear it even in the next door . it is really a kind of distraction .
maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done .
good idea .
of course you can . i am sure this one works very well . i just sent dozens of pages . how many pages are you sending ? are you familiar with my fax machine ?
yes i think you have the same model as i have . does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
yes it will print immediately .
it seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
do you know how to do it ? i am not so good at machine things . i will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
check with somebody from the it department . they are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
we have thought of you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience .
yes . i think that is what i m interested in .
well i think nothing of a worry . but i think a lot of responsibilities are better .
maybe you could hire me on trial if i m not qualified for this position you can let me go .
i 'll appreciate that .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
oh that 's all right . so what can i do for you today ?
why would anyone vote for him ?
how ?
really ?
i think there 's nothing wrong with your company .
you 're right .
that sounds like a good idea .
when i worked there i was a job i wanted to work in my previous company .
ok i will . goodbye .
yes speaking .
i m calling to offer you the position of computer engineer .
that 's fine with me .
when you start to work i ll give you 3000 yuan a month .
so you have to open all the envelopes .
yes except the personal mail . and i also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the email box regularly .
do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
yes and i check all the emails for mr . thomas .
where is that ?
i 'll be here to pick you up at 630 .
that 's good . it 's always my pleasure .
my pleasure . well then how is your family ?
goodbye .
i have to go to work on saturday .
i want to create a password for this document . please tell me how to do it .
it 's october the 1st our national day . i 'd like to talk some more but i 've got to get going now . it was nice talking to you though .

oh we 've got plenty of time .
you wo n't be late . it 's still early .
well that 's true . but let me see if i can . . .
it does n't matter .
thank you .
no really .
not bad . but i 've heard that the marketing manager has some new project coming up in the u . s .
so you can have more room for development .
thank you . but i 've never done this before .
i m calling to see if you have made your decision . you are the right person we are seeking for .
it 's 1000 p . m . and it 's four o 'clock in los angeles right ?
very well and how many people will attend tonight ?
please allow me to go to sleep .
that 's true .
what 's your favorite flower ?
yes . i ve got a meeting in a minute .
and what is it going to be chinese food or western food ?
i 'm still suffering from a little jetlag .
no do n't worry . i 'm afraid you 're going to be engaged .
yeah you should encourage your employer to make it to the necessary arrangements .
wait a minute . i 'll check it out .
the pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic .
it s about two miles away . that s about the rent .

to be frank our marketing manager is in charge of the market in the country .

oh hello mr . jones i am very pleased to meet you .
thank you . i 've done a lot .
i also want to know if the company is still available .
what about the expression goodbye ? is that an idiom ?
i think it 's a brilliant idea . but i am not sure .
well have you ever thought about learning some chinese ?
there 's a list of those who famous art in our company . i think we should ask them to give us some information .
what 's playing at the century fox ?
the commission is very reasonable . but i hope you will find our price comes up with the high profit margins from 50 to 20 percent .
the european market is not familiar with your products . you have competitors from japan and other continental countries . at the beginning of our campaign there is sales resistance to overcome we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news papers and tv programs . a 10 commission will not leave us much .
so what kind of demands do you have ? what are the basic stress of this such an eye for example ?
well what can you expect us to do with the general terms of the agreement ?
yes .
our commission is 100 .
all right .
please call my john . well can you tell me about it ?
well we have a life of bees .
i appreciate your efforts in the interview .
thank you . i won t miss it .

thanks . shall we meet again sometime ?
that s fine . i appreciate your cooperation .
i bought one size up by mistake .
i 'm afraid that i could n't agree with you more .
i don t know .
i see . the goods must have been <unk> in the past . you know our exports are strictly inspected the goods in the end when they left the inspection . the goods were in love with the long term .
ah . . . yes we have . the clock is terrific . could you tell me your name and phone number please ?
i think the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons . first it s just a piece of cake .
what s the average income ?
let me see . laptop flash disk a ballpoint pen a pencil a notebook a pair of glasses cell phone charger moisture notion . . . oh that is too much . you are not going to a business trip .
i guess i need all of them .
actually the company will provide you with all of these supplies . so you can leave this very thick notebook at home .
i know . but it is my lucky charm . i carry it all the time .
suit yourself . don t forget to set the alarm clock .
yes i 'm a very good singer but i 'm very excited about it .

i get a couple of weeks from almost 9 to 5 in the morning .
how often do i have to pay ?
you are very kind to say so . thank you .
i am very happy to hear that .
all right .
in my opinion a secretary must be familiar with office routine and try to do some things by you .
i 'm sorry sir . we propose a sole agency agreement for this .
yes that 's right . you are right .
i 'm fine . how are you ?
yes . first of all the important documents are a little research about the terms and the terms .
sure i 've got it .
no problem . we have many different kinds of things here .
what time do you expect ?
ok . i 'll take one .
what 's playing at the century fox ?
i will explain it in detail in the next class could you preview it ?
yes here you are .

yes it is .
i am calling to tell you the items you are supposed to bring for the interview the day after tomorrow .
but i need to take some medicines with me . i ca n't take the step .

i have just left school but i am well acquainted with office work .
what qualities would you expect of persons working as a team ?
i 'm not feeling well .
of course . it 's the most important thing to be here .
i 'm a bit of a problem .
again . you should send him to the boarding school . he is an excellent teacher .
i 'm sorry to say that i have to call you back .
i do n't know . the number is clearly .
but i still ca n't believe you .
i want justice .
i see . but now you 're from the top of the job you 've applied for .

he 's terribly sorry . you can t say that . do n't you want to call mr . white ?

why do i need an appointment ?

oh yes . i remember . very nice to meet you .
nice to meet you too .
sorry but he 's not in . may i take a message for you ?
yes . would you please ask him to call me back as soon as he can ? my name 's mary and i 'm calling from happy travel .
ok i 'll tell him .
good morning . i m looking for a onebedroom apartment .
do you have a particular type of card ?
no . but it is urgent . i need to see a doctor as soon as possible . i am really in bad shape .
have you taken his license or colleagues 's license ?
of course . i 'm already in a meeting .
i 'm not sure . but i 'll get a table ready as fast as i can .
i 'll wait .
i see .
i am the manager . what about ?
i need to know about the details of the contract . let me just check . you can have a look at the data .
no i 'm afraid i ca n't .
nine o 'clock would be fine .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
yes i am sorry . i missed the bus .
but there 's a bus every ten minutes and you are over 1 hour late .
well i missed several buses .
how on earth can you miss several buses ?
i ah . . . i got have late .
oh come on gordon it 's the afternoon now . why were you late really ?
well i . . . i lost my wallet and i . . .
oh that 's too bad . was it stolen ?
yes i found it again .
when ?
yesterday . she wore that gown last night and showed it off to everybody at mr . mile s party .
i am not convinced by your explanation .
this is brown speaking . i 'd like to speak to mr . tomas .
i 'm sorry he is not here at the moment . he has gone to the international business center .
how about tomorrow afternoon ?
he 's terribly sorry . you can t say that . do n't you want to call mr . white ?
is there any other way i can reach him ?
i 'm afraid not he has gone out of this town on business .
yes . can you please let him know i called and ask him to call me back as soon as possible ? my name 's mary and i 'm calling from happy travel .
would you like to make another appointment ?
why do i need an appointment ?
i see . what about the other records ?
what can i do for you ?
you 're welcome .
it 's a lot harder than i expected . but i 've got to go .
i 'm so sorry .
no . should i have ?
yes i understand .
he 'll be back in about an hour at least .
i would be able to help you .
i will . and in my opinion should we have a good rest to keep learning daily skills around the future .
i suggest you hunt for a job on the internet . it 's a rule .
you are very nice to hear that .
you 're welcome .
that sounds interesting . but i do n't know how to do that .
do n't worry . you can find a parttime job here .
we 'd better make it .
but we 'll miss the news .
i will think about it .
but the sales number is close to the predicted amount .
do you have any textbooks to help me ?
i also think it 's a good idea to buy products from the government .
if so we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks .
what i mean is that we 'll never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great .
i think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . how about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ?
what is your proposal ?
i think to get the business done you should at least reduce the price by 20 .
i 'm glad to hear that .
i 'm sorry we ca n't . our price is final price . you 'll have to reduce the price to 12 . we ca n't go any further .
oh i do n't know . it depends .
thank you !
that 's great . we ca n't go any further .
certainly .
i am thinking about buying a secondhand computer .
what about the quality ?
what 's the difference between the two ?
well i was looking forward to something a bit more substantial . as you know we have longtime cooperation .
i have no idea . maybe you can give me a discount .
if we 're not the one that will be our problem . the price is still on the high side .
yeah i guess so . but i want to start with a few months ago !
where are the keys ?
which one is this ?
i 'd like to say the importance of packing is too difficult to handle .
of course . what kind of price are you interested in ?
oh i 'm going to europe .
how do you protect these from now ?
what about the dessert ?
i had a marketing manager .
yes . we have a small room in white and a bottle of red wine .
i would need an idea of how large your company would be . about how many units ?
10000 sets for the one of whitecollar and 5000 for men's jackets .
that 's true . and sometimes the private group tours are really expensive .
ok i 'll wait to it .
he 's ok . she 's a bit nervous i guess . but i had a hard time to get him to do .
what s he like ?
you should send him to pick up his own business . he s sure he will like it .
guess he s going to be your best friend .
well i m wondering if you could give me a call sometime next week .
i do n't mind the work . i think it 's worthwhile .
thank you .
we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sale of our products .
it 's been my pleasure to work with you .
may i try it on ?
as long as you don t have any experience as you will be a successful <unk> .
i 'm glad to hear that .
it 's our pleasure .
have you thought about it seriously ?
yes i have been thinking about it for quite a while . now i finally make up my mind to leave . i have given my resignation letter to our boss last friday .
ok did you find a new company ?
yes i will move on to xyz company .
good for you but your leaving will be a great loss to us . it is so nice to work with you .
thanks . i had learned so much from you and our colleagues .
it 's always worth trying .
it s a great idea .
i 'm a nurse at a hospital .
well i am not sure . lets me check my agenda
ok .
i 'm afraid she 's out .
it is ok with me . so i will be arriving at your office around two fifteen pm .
i 'd like to see the inside of your city .
what is the problem ?
i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
it is ok . you look really pale and red eyes . i suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest .
thank you very much . i am sure good rest will do indeed . i don t have this too often .
well it is hard to say . at least you need to come up with a good reason .
my husband is betting on france .
yes you should be there . go find the manager and ask . i think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . it will be signed by the manager of the manager 's name .
thank you so much .
it is a good idea . but i will do my best to do the job well .
ok . please take a seat . i know you are a very good accountant .
yes we do . we usually go on a lot of time . but i 'm not sure which service will have to be done before the show .
i 've looked at your resume . what was the job ?
my experience is a menu . i would like to work in a restaurant .
how can you manage to get a job on the internet ?
i would like to make a call to taipei taiwan please .
ha i am flattered . actually when it comes to negotiate you don t need to like it . you just need to understand how it works .
i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice .
well generally speaking if you want to change someone s mind or understand his position you have to put yourself in his shoes . understand his need and the cost for his need . and then you work together to find a solution .
sounds easy . but how can i apply to practice ? i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . but i am afraid our boss will turn me down .
ok as john after kennedy put it let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate .
that is very encouraging news . i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . that is to say the r d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
it is not an easy job . how do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
that 's the best part . i am sure our customers will be happy to have the same .
certainly .
oh you are so efficient . i thought you might give it to me tomorrow . thanks .
you re welcome . you know these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . the more i think about it the more i hate myself for being so disorganized . i decided to change the situation as soon as possible . otherwise i will be more regretful later .
this is encouraging news good for you ! what is your solution then ?
the most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
sounds not bad ! better performance isn t just about doing a lot more . it is about focusing on the right things to do .
i would n't mind getting a good rest . and i also want to take the medicine i am on the stewardess .
i think you re right .
that 's right .
but you need to be eye contact with people .
it will be hard at first but i think i can do it .
what s the matter ?
but if i saw the results in the company you are interested in .
thank you for your consideration . i hope you will be in touch with our answer .
i wanted to meet with you to discuss your daughter .
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i 'd like to postpone that discussion until later . maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position and how your commission structure works .
it s a monthly salary which has been determined according to the first year of the company .
500 dollars .
very good . which one would you like to work in ?
it 's the most important thing to me .
yes you have a total of 21 days paid vacation and a year of paid vacation every year .
yes i do . who are your financial backers ? who are the key competitors ? does the company have a plan for the ipo ? what would you say is the best thing about your product or service ?
yes .
no problem . i am looking forward to it .
generally it is 6 months and during the period you are halfpaid .
i 'm not sure about that .
okay mr . sandals . your reservation is in our computer . all we need now is a phone number .
i see . what about the maximum purdy and rate any change ?
generally speaking training new members is usually necessary .
i can help you with that . what are you need ?
you 're welcome .
sure .
what time would you like to take the test ?
i think they 'd be glad to be able to fix it right now .
yes and please get it ready by thursday morning .
eight o 'clock tonight would you please set us in a private room ?
could you please tell me what the problem is ?
i 'll do my best .
yes .
is there a supermarket nearby ?
what 's up ?
hello . i 'm mr . bob . there is something wrong with this company . it 's not just a big question .
i see .
i got the message . i 'm quiting .
not at all . why don t you join me ?
no way . i 'm too busy these days . i 'm thinking of dropping out .
i don t know about that . with all the uncertainty in the markets right now it would be a very unwise decision to invest . i don t know if you re aware son but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . there have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . there s just too much instability . i wouldn t feel comfortable investing in this climate .
what type of business are you interested in ?
you re welcome !
i was born in shanghai and went to paris .
yes . is this the right counter for gloves ?
yes but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?
yes i have a lot of previous experiences in sales . i worked in sales departments for two companies since i finished my university .
that sounds fine . please give me your name and phone numbers . i ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . it will most likely be in a couple of days . is it all right for you ?
yes my name is brian and my phone number is 5294870 .
thank you .
your major must be computer .
do you think my educational background suits this position ?
yes i m quite satisfied with your qualifications .
does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ?
generally speaking training new members is usually necessary . we offer our new employees a oneweek training course .
could you tell something about the job ?
yes of course . you will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints .
oh i see . i believe i can do the job well .
ok . i should have it finished by friday afternoon . then i can check those account over the weekend . we need to have them finished by monday right ?
that s right . we ll finish them just in time . the macy project can wait for the time being . we need to spend several days on that project but it isn t due to be finished until the end of the month s
from next week on we should be in less of a rush .
i m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . everyone deserves it .
don t say that yet . a new project could suddenly appear .
that s true . right . i m going back to the meeting . it s been going on for hours and there s no indication that it ll end soon .
carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is uptodate with their work .
good . i have to go right now . i really hope this meeting doesn t last too long .
they usually go on for ages .
great . i ll see you later .
i will . enjoy your meeting !
not at all . go ahead .
well . you see i don t like the office . i don t like the staff . and i m afraid of you . and i don t want to go one . so may i put info a transfer ?
not really so long as you follow all the regulations .
if you make mistakes in your job you 'll be fired . is that right ?
no . everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . the most important thing is to be responsible for your work .
working here involves a busy schedule and overtime . is that true ?
yes . that s true . we are always busy . the company attaches great importance to high efficiency . sometimes we have to work overtime but not always . and we have extra pay for extra work .
it seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as i expected . thank you for your help .
well the internal factors are very important and the same thing is that our product is <unk> . what i see in your words ?
i hope that they accepted the counteroffer but i don t think the best they could do is to win the fair .
we might have a lot of homework to buy a new one but we should do some <unk> to see what we can do .
it does n't seem like a hot day for summer .
you bet .
now i have to open all these magazines and read about the article .
i hope that they have a good idea .
no problem .
it s just what we need to be done .
it 's freezing .
that 's why people hold different areas like that . the chinese men in the first year of the year and the elderly grandfather was really <unk> by the end of the year . in the long run they do n't look after the television .
it will be very expensive to live in .
yes but have you made an appointment ahead ?
yes of course . i am monica . i have made an appointment with your hr manager .
just a minute please . i ll make a call to the hr office .
thank you very much .
you 're welcome .
you mean the network connection ?
yes i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . it took me almost one minute to open it . then there is no response to any click .
i have the same question . i can t send out mails . we d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately .
ok .
it 's possible . but the worst part is we can do is to stop the sand storm . it was <unk> with the windows and there was n't so much damage .
any other clues ?
i 'm glad you 're replacing it . we will have the new figures .
let 's see . . . you are importing fifty containers of textiles from china . they should be able to place your order before the end of next week . it will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of ningpo . the freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in los angeles approximately a month from today . domestic shipping will be your responsibility you can make
fine . we will handle domestic shipping but what about customs ? will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? i hope we do n't run into any problems with the border control .
no the chinese company has that all worked out . with the paperwork you receive with the shipment you should be good to go .
what else should i learn first ?
then how many other options are we talking about ?
wow . then what about the countryside ?
i think you should call the sellers with my acceptance . they can make sure everything goes on and then there .
well i 've never been on a bus before . it 's not far from the bus .
what is your impression of the job ?
of course . it was a first person in my country .
the factory was excellent !
i would never want to be a singer . it 's so different to have a good time .
you would n't do that .
that 's a good idea . but what about the expression of your family ?
is this the place that is where people come from ?
i would suggest you take the first course at the end of the month .
no way ! i 'm not sure about it .
yes of course . there is a bank in this account .
how long is the tour ?
yes but i don t think so . what do you think ?
i see . did your parents ask you to come to the room ?
just remember that we and when we get off the bus .
can you come back in the morning with a top shape ?
they were in charge of the whole account .
it was great . i think i may have gone to the beach in my life .
you paid for the 50 dollars ?
well . i 've got a lot of good ones in the field . i 'd like to take a look at the pamphlet when we see the doctor .
sounds reasonable .
yes it is . we could not go out for a walk in the same boat .
it 's no problem at all . can we meet again first ?
ok .
oh you really think i need to do this .
thank you .
i ve met some of my colleagues already . i m sure we ll get on well together .
don t use office phones for personal matters . of course both methods are being used to break out and out the details of the question .
i think the job should make use of the professional experience i have obtained and offer me opportunity for advancement .
why do you think you might like to work for our company ?
well there are 2 reasons . first of all i 'm itching to work in a foreign enterprise . secondly your branch is a new establishment in beijing . i think i 'll be assigned more workload and responsibilities here .
what makes you think you would be a success in this position ?
my graduate school training combined with my experience as an intern should qualify me for this particular job . i am sure i will be successful .
how do you know about this company ?
your company is very reputed in this city . i heard much praise to your company .
yes i have received an engineers qualification certificate and a drivers license .
have you worked in a computer company before ?
i have two years years years driving experience .
that s good . what special skills do you have can you tell me ?
i have experience in computer operation proficiency in microsoft windows microsoft word and microsoft excel .
what computer languages have you learned ?
visual c and delphi .
have you gotten any special training in programming ?
no but i have taken elective courses in computer in college .
i had a nightmare !
i should have brought some magazines and newspapers that are read about the article . i think i should get some insight from you .
of course . is it your first time to come to a concert ?
thank you .
i will .
no problem . first of all can you tell me how to get the reply from the sites ?
thank you very much .
yes i do .
i 'd be very glad to .
when will you be able to start my new job ?
can we get in touch with you by email ? is this convenient for you ?
that 's fine with me .

no but i do n't know the exact time .
i can always go to the movies .
well actually i 'm not so sure . but i know it 's a good habit .
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't .
usually the real step is to have a few minutes specific information about it .
i need to do something tomorrow .
ok i 'll be there around 6 .
yes i have read your resume . i m interested in the advertisement for a graduate student visa .
does this camera hurt you ?
i can help you with that .
yes . i worked in a fashion shop as a part time salesgirl .
i 've looked at your resume and resume .

it 's much better than my old boss . but i am not sure about it .

i saw emily yesterday evening . she was wearing a cd evening gown .

yeah we do n't need the <unk> training .
come on in this afternoon . i will call you .
i am worried . i know there is a new desk in my living room .
yes .
yes . every night i think i 'm not good at it .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
but it 's the end of the world .
i think there 's a mistake on the tv now .
well china is located on the <unk> plate where earthquakes happen frequently due to the earth 's plates knocking against each other .
yes it 's not a very expensive place .
wow ! nobody told me .
but do n't you think china is a changing world ? it 's very different from what we have to do in this world .
that 's ok .
this is not what i call .
okay i got two tickets .
come on . let 's talk about a little practice .
i 'm afraid there 's been a mistake .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
i do n't understand why you ca n't return the car there .
yes that 's right .
ok i think i 'll go and meet you at the same time .

wow . that 's really a great idea .
we can hold them until two o 'clock .

you 're welcome .
do you know what time it is ?
morning . can i help you ?
a cup of hot orange juice .

yeah i tried to quit last month and i thought it was going to be easy but it turns out that i 'm still smoking .
oh yes i 've got a suit from the blue general manager .
then i 'll try to find a seat in the smoking section . but i 'm afraid i ca n't find my seat in the smoking section .
i would like to talk to you about my accommodation situation .
we 're only ready to put a customer on the line . let 's put it up .
what 's the difference ?
i will send a memo to you . it is about the meeting and ask you to come in and see me .
i got the message . i 'm quiting .
that 's very kind of you to say . by the way do you know the number of the person you want to call ?
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . th
yes it seems that we have . the only problem is that you need to get a mortgage with us .
that 's right .

that 's a great question . you know he is from the head of the city .
it is a new little expensive but it 's not much use .
thank you . have you got a receipt ?
he said he was our cousin who ran into a red light and got good reviews .
i have a friend . he is my best friend and he wants to learn english . he would pay about 100 yuan per hour .

i appreciate your help .
that 's good . i think i 'd better take this two .
the lower branches are very relaxed and peaceful .
yes . what 's your name ?
how about this one ?
i 'm not sure but i think they 're in luck .
you can get a balance of that . perhaps you can buy the car instead of going to a cheap evening .
i do n't know . we 're right in the middle of this .
it s a program about islam . it s very interesting .
wow ! so many people ! where are they and what are they doing ?
they are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . muslims call this pilgrimage haj .
why do they go there ?
they played ball at school . here we go . yijun go out for a pass !
when muslims pray they face towards mecca .
that s right . unfortunately so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .
i heard about that . the pilgrims must walk around a large sacred black stone .
that s right . that s when accidents often happen . the saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims to reduce the chances of accidents .
pilgrimages are common in many <unk> .
yes . in england christian pilgrims might go to canterbury and many christians go to the <unk> on pilgrimages .
isn t there a place in france ?
i think that place is <unk> . there are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .
do you think that there is something magical about that place ?
personally . i think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that <unk> them . i don t think place is magical in any way .
how about you ?
i do n't know what a great idea .
well to be honest nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss .
i hate to take you to pick up some stuff that is n't fair .
maybe that 's why i want to do something romantic .
that s great . thank you !
i do n't think they are right . i have tried my best and that 's enough . it is unfair that they are always saying these thing . sometimes i even feel deeply hurt .

i m so happy for the family ! they must be very relieved and excited about that .
i m sure they are . oh and a local man won the lottery . i m so jealous ! i wish it were me ! i buy a lottery ticket every week and i m amazed that i haven t even won a small prize yet . it s so unfair !
don t be moody ! i hope you re not tired because we ve been invited to a party this evening . i know how excited you get about parties .
we have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . most people call them mp s .
each mp belongs to a political party right ?
almost all of them do . a few are independent . that means that they do not belong to a party . if one party more than half of the mp s . that means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members .
what s a cabinet ?
this is a small group of peopleperhaps 25 mp s who are usually <unk> . they make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
can any mp make a law ?
any mp can present a law to parliament . the proposed law is debated and voted on . if it is accepted it becomes law .
i suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
yes it does . they have most of the mp s . most mp s vote the way their party wants them to .
how do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
they produce manifesto . these documents which states their policies . some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters .
