this is great ! your dress is great ! well i will try to take the advantage and i hope that you like it .
thank you . we will give you a discount if you order here .
i do n't know . i ca n't afford to live on it now .
i am sorry to hear that sir . but i am sure you 'll find our market now .
she 's a lawyer .
hmm sir . . . that 's the good idea .
that 's a great idea .
well i guess it is not a common teacher . i think they 've got a copy of the house who 's going to do it this thing .
yes . but i ca n't see it now .
cool down harry ! what are you really mad about ? did you get ripped off ?
yes . last sunday i went to a nearby market . it was on <unk> fair . i chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot without even trying to strike a bargain . i paid one hundred and twenty . and just
is that so ? i 'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . it 's the norm of free trade . the seller sets
but i think it 's not just a good reason for him .
of course that 's something really irritation . and the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . i recommend you to consult the price tags in the superb
okay . let me see if there 's no need .
i wo n't be late .
no but the difference is to make sure we are here .
well you can have three different questions .
yes i can .
i go to bed at ten and get up at six .
that 's helpful for your health .
sure .
yes i am . i am ready for the job .
yes . we are going to have a look at this tree .
what about his hair ?
how 's your suggestion ?
yes i think so . i really look at it this afternoon . it s very nice and convenient to see you .
ok .
i am sorry . mr . green ?
no thank you .
you re welcome .
<unk> yuan .
it 's very expensive .
yes we do .
would you mind if i helped out in the kitchen instead ? i do enjoy cooking .
this is supposed to be your vacation we 'd like you to just relax .
cooking makes me feel relaxed . so what are we cooking ?
ok well we 're going to make a pan of lasagne a salad and some garlic bread . here 's the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?
sure . we should probably preheat the oven right away too .
that 's a good idea . can you set the oven to 200 degrees celsius ?
that 's a bit high for lasagne . i 'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there .
fine . i 'll just get out the casserole dish the <unk> the salad bowl and the baking sheet .
you know i could do this myself . why do n't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ?
i do n't think it 's broken .
well if it 's not broken then you need to learn how to vacuum better because it does n't look like you 've vacuumed for ages !
fine . i 'll go vacuum . let me know if you need any other help .
yes go along this way .
will you let me know where to get off ?
sure . it s on the left .
thank you .
take it easy . you will be there alone .
thank you very much .
it 's a fortyfive minute to an hour ride .
no problem .
you are welcome .
of course . is the dinner still on ?
yes i was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .
we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .
that 's what i thought you would do . listen i live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . it 's just down the street from all the bars . you probably do n't want to be walking around after dark .
it ca n't be that bad .
i wish it was n't but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .
really ? i never would have guessed . the criminals must only come out in the evenings because i 've never noticed anything strange when i 've been at your house in the daytime .
do me a favor and take a taxi . it 'd make me feel a lot better .
ok we will . how do you get around in the evenings ?
when i first moved in i walked everywhere . but within a week i had my purse stolen just a block away from the police station ! now i always take public transportation .
has anything else happened to you ?
nothing else has happened to me but i have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close .
well we 'll be careful . thanks for letting me know .
sure . we have an appointment right now .
how long do you think there should be ?
please keep your traffic away . i can t stand it .
i know . but we have to do everything here .
it looks like you 've had everything . i think it 's ready to change the sun in one day .
i m so tired by the time .
don t mention it . please call us if you re lucky .
i have a headache and my own mother .
hi honey . you have n't seen me for that .
well we have n't had a few openings in the first but we had our own price .
that 's true . you have a good one .
i believe that two people did get hurt .
that 's too bad . where did you go ?
i 'll do that now . you 'll have to fill in the details .
i think that the show is a little different .
well they 're both older and they are their <unk> .
not sir . how are you ?
you do n't know where that is ?
yes sir . we have just brought your card with you .
i will see you .
i 'm afraid not now .
thank you .
do n't worry about him . he 's very tall and slim .
you can see that we can do nothing .
you know i hate shopping more than anything else in this city .
i know . but we could get some exercise in and we could get some errands run too . windowshopping won t cost you anything .
what kind of errands do we need to run ?
well we could go to the newsagent s to pick up the sunday paper go to the butcher s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner and to the chemist s to pick up your prescription from the doctor .
how long will we meet with him ?
fine we 'll do that on the way home so we can have it right away .

i promise . we re only going to have a picnic for my own .

can you tell me what kind of room do you have ?
yes we do . here 's our list .
thank you .
because i m not in the mood that s why .
well don t just sit there do something . come and help me in the kitchen .
help you in the kitchen i don t feel like it .
would you like to clear the table then ?
really ? do i have to do it ?
not if you don t want to .
really it 's so beautiful .
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
you must n't take it this way .
where it is ?
it is a private garden . it 's a very big garden in the city .
yes ?
can you get me a beach umbrella and a deck chair ? i am really tired of lying in thousand .
why not ?
i was n't feeling well .
i 'm not sure .
the doctor says smoking will not be late .
sorry i 'm very near sighted .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do it again .
try to be more careful in future .
i can t . i ll make a little nervous but i m not sure how to deal with such a hot one !
i think so if it starts at first you can find the information on the website .
i am not surprised you eat too much .
and i suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office does n't help .
no i would n't think so .
i do wish i could lose weight .
well why do n't you go on the diet ?
i 've tried diets before but they 've never worked .
perhaps you should excercise more . why do n't you go to an exercise class .
yes maybe i should .
that is just an excuse . you can always find some time to exercise .
but i work hard all the time for long hours . often i have no time for lunch . yet i am still getting fatter .
bill you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . and skipping meals will not help you lose weight . in fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals .
i know you 're right but what can i do ?
how about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ?
but i 'll miss the news . it 's important in my business to keep up with events in china .
i know i know . have you got a portable radio ? you can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time .
that 's a good idea !
oh it 's delicious . i like to get them to a good family .
now please wait a moment . . . here is your bill . the next one is 15 .
thank you . i will .
we 're going to have our own pizza section .
they 're hot .
and anything else ?
i 'm sorry but i 've already got lunch at lunch .
when they are dancing you dance gracefully !
well i swim and run every day .
now tell me what do you eat ?
well i do n't eat any meat but i do eat fish and eggs .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
oh yes and fruit i love fruit .
what do you drink ?
well i never drink alcohol coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
what do you drink ?
you too . have you lost some weight ?
yes i took off 4 kilos . i am glad you notice it .
not some crazy diet fat i hope .
no no i just changed my eating habits . i eat a balance meal . and i eat less than before .
good for you keep it up .
oh i 'm sorry . who has n't that bad .
i 'm sorry . there 's no difference at the moment .
that s nice . this is jane . i want to change .
i m glad that the apartment can be <unk> in full amount . i just want to be able to find a different way to cover the contract .
i ll send you an application for you .
no thanks . i have had enough .
actually you have n't had much .
to tell you the truth i am on the diet .
that sounds ridiculous . why ?
well i am gaining weight these days and i have to watch my calories .
no do n't try to tempt me . i 'm becoming chubby and i have to slender down .
you are not really chubby . you are actually thin enough .
i do n't think so . i know i 've put on weight this winter .
so you are watching your weight are n't you ?
yes to tell you the truth . i am on the diet .
where are you heading now ?
i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road . it is very close to your house .
is that the university next to the teachers college ?
that 's the one .
you mean we 'll share the taxi ?
yeah . if we share the cab it 'll be cheaper . besides that your chinese is better than mine . the drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though i practice my pronunciation carefully .
well . don t worry about it i will be happy to share the taxi with you .
take me to the airport please .
are you in a hurry ?
yes i should have one to fix it .
we 'll have to cancel it sir .
there 's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
i 'll do my best .
here 's twenty dollars .
do n't worry . i 'm leaving here for business .
no . if you ca n't give me the cash .
here is your receipt . thank you .
yes they all stop at this corner .
i want to go to broadway and 82nd street . can i take any bus that comes along ?
you can take any bus except the number 9 .
how often do the buses run ?
they run about every five minutes .
fine . how long does it take to get to 82nd street ?
about fifteen minutes . it 's not far . are you a stranger in new york ?
yes i am . i arrived only three days ago from japan .

yes . i caught a number 7 bus yesterday and they said i had taken a wrong bus .

i don t mind paying high rent to live in new york .
why ? you pay so much for such a tiny space to live .
yeah but so what ! i m proud to live in the world s most exciting city . and the salaries here are the highest in the nation too .

no .
yes that 's right .
i do n't usually have a big deal with you . this is a bit different .
i know that . but i am not paying for it .

we bought 1000 sets of chemical instruments from you but there are 40 not up to the standard .

i don t mind that . but she disagrees with me about everything .
you should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . you shouldn t affect her decision .
but i just want to give her some tips .
oh she can make her own decisions .
i guess you are right .
believe me . everything will be ok .
i hope so .
but yesterday you said you would rent it .
i ve changed my mind .

and must i go back to school ?
no you need n't do that . you 'd better get a parttime job somewhere and go to evening classes .
but dad i should be working fulltime at my age . i m nearly 17 .
you ought to have worked harder then you wouldn t have failed your exams . you have to take a job and study .
what else i ve got to do ? join the army ?

what ? really ? i don t really want to have to buy a new phone .
well you re in luck ! you see if you sign up for our threeyear plan we ll throw in a handset for free .

what sort of <unk> are we dealing with ?
we just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything . we have termites in the wood cockroaches all over the place and last night i saw a huge rat out in the backyard !
well there s nothing we can t handle . i ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches but the termites will be harder to get rid of . we will have to cover the entire house and <unk> it . unfortunately that means you will have to stay for the next three days .
no problem . just get rid of the bugs !
morning michael . how are you ?
well rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run please sit down . coffee ?
no . i 'm not in the mood . when is there anything else i can help ?
haha i could never do that . i d be a zombie if i didn t have my morning coffee fix . let s get down to business then .
yes . i ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . the demand for phone cameras is growing and pear has been falling behind in the market .
that s great ! i m glad to hear that pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . now there is a very good one for our sole agency .
no we re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . we were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
surely . let s get started by drafting a new contract .
sure what kind of shoe are you looking for ? we ve got <unk> sandals sleek high heels edgy pumps or if you re looking for something a little more practical we ve got mary janes ballerinas .
show me some classic high heels please .
ok right this way . what color did you have in mind ?
black . classic .
of course . we ve got this style here that is very popular . because it s an opentoe shoe you can wear it any time of the year . they look great on everyone .
umm . too shiny . and i wear pantyhose with my shoes so let s look for a <unk> shoe .
ok these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a twoinch heel so they are very comfortable .
well the kitchen is a little tight and their fresh color is quite fresh and soft . i think that color is very nice .
not ? maybe i can find something similar to you . i also told them that i don t buy a lot of money .
<unk> .
mine 's 2020 . life just is n't fair is it ?
it 's a good buy . it 's not as much as you can .
yeah . i will wait to get it for you . the fitting room is over there . i ll see you on this .
why not ? come on ! just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
i will ! i ll feed it bathe it and walk it every day ! we can get a <unk> or a german <unk> !
what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus our apartment is too small for that <unk> of dog .
ok . how about a picnic ?
we re planning on having children soon i don t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
fine ! let s get a bird then ! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! a parrot would be awesome !
i ll tell you what i can get you some hamsters and we ll take it from there .
<unk> !
well since we are getting up so late i decided to make a big breakfast !
nice ! brunch !
kind of so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
wow ! you really went all out ! did you make any coffee ?
yeah just the way you like it ! i also put out some cereal and <unk> if you feel like having something more light .
looks good ! i ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
get the jam and butter while you are in there ! oh ! and don t forget to get the bread !
what ? you don t know the first thing about gardening !
on the contrary i have been reading a lot of books about the subject .
oh yeah ? tell me then smarty pants how will you go about setting up your garden ?
well first i need to buy some things such as fertilizer seeds and tools .
what type of tools ?
you know the basics . a rake shovel spade and a hoe .
right . well it seems like you have all your bases covered . what s next ?
i ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . i ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! gardening all done !
well good luck with your garden especially considering we are in the dry season and it won t rain for the next three months !
no thank you i am not interested .
please ma am if you could get the order ready for one .
i wish i could but i have to walk the dog and finish cooking so if you would excuse me .
we have a great variety of magazines all about cooking ! this one for example is a bi monthly publication with recipes from all over the world !
wow that would be kind of useful do you have any other cooking magazines ?
sure do ! this one is a quarterly publication but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas !
wow this is nice ! ok sign me up for both publications .
you mentioned you have a dog most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care pet shops and even pet sitters !
that is exactly what i needed ! what else do you have ?
well i also have . . .
no . i just ca n't find out . i 'm going to buy some new food today .
there are two choices you can choose from .
that 's a good idea . i think it 's good for him to do some good work .
you haven t talk to me about it . i m sure you ll have a job or something . maybe i can find one or two things later . i m sure you can do it .
ok . i m very busy with that . maybe this promotion is going to work with my boss .
i m very well thank you . and you ?
anything else ?
yes i want to change some money .
that s fine . is there any way to sign your name ?

that 's great ! thank you .
i m great . thanks .
good then let s get to the interview .
i need to cancel a check .

that s fine . i can see you later today .
don t you know christmas is coming ? i have a lot of things to get ready .
oh what is the rent ?
how are you ?
yes . we have reservations on the left of that side .
i m afraid you can t be there .
do you think i can make that too ?
i 'm sorry but there is no vacant apartment .
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
i see . you can have this one in my apartment .
yeah i 'd like to send it to you .
do you want to sign it ?
that 's ok .
okay . let s call it up to me .
no i 'll be there at seven .
you are lucky . you d better get up if you don t mind .
i 've got my passport and card .
no . i think there 's some need . you just need to have some rest .
there are a few problems with a lot of the people there . in my opinion you are so smart . i think the government had a good offer today .
you need a good choice .
with the computer you should use it .
what kind of color you want to provide ?
the check for a new product . this is the first time that we made a decision .
i ca n't see you at that .
is it full of clothes ?
yes .
hmm . . . yes of course . i 'll take the taxi .
you can really liked it . besides it s completely different from the world .
do you have the taste of it ?
well i think it 's not too bad for any kind of apartment .
well i think i like it very much .
you re right .
what is it ?
exactly how long is my lease for ?
i got an idea .
all right . i ll try my best to do it .
where s your polling place ?
there is a few things i need help .
what happened ?
thanks a lot . i appreciate your help .
i want to ask you a couple questions .
would you like to sit by us ?
i have a question .
of course . the only problem is that there is a small supermarket .
fine . i really will have to be there in a few minutes .
you don t see many people who are concerned about taking the girls to read .
i can take that apartment right now .
yes you can . but i 'm afraid that there will be no problem .
that would be great .
then i 'll take you to dinner .
we appreciate your business .
it 's not really .
so it will be a large apartment .
of course not everyone is going to sell things for a black one .
could you use my camera ?
the tape player doesn t work .
i would like to see if you could come a few more minutes .
are you aware of the quality ?
you should check the connections .
that 's fine with me .
you can see the apartments with the stock price .
yes i know . it s the first step that is really tough .
i will be there as soon as i can .
what are your plans now that you re getting out ?
the ad says 325 plus deposit .
that is truly cheap .
this is a good exercise .
well i think we may agree on that . i ca n't afford it .
it ll be fixed to 4 months .
may be sure .
how much more ?
that 's right .
great . what time would you like to meet ?
i 've got it but i 've got to go .
i ve had the same idea of a credit card .
can you tell me the exact part of the meeting ?
when was the meeting you need ?
i believe you can be really <unk> right away .
i see exactly what you will find .
yes you can either take a test or off the internet .
your order is still on the line .
i found it this afternoon and i did n't realize it was that my time . i had to work for hours . so i had to be the best late .
to be honest i 'm sure you 'll get a new one with a new carpet .
oh i will .
make you call the transfer no . 2 more to the national claim and the number is not just a big line .
well i will take that one .
i wish i had a good chance to try my best . i really am sure this place is perfect for you .
that 's a good idea . i think i can handle it by myself .
i hear that 's what you can do .
i will try to the next one .
i was hoping to go to paris .
yes . which one is the brake again ?
the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas .
i m glad this car is an automatic . i do n't like having to change gears .
automatics are very simple to drive . the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver s seat !
very funny . next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . can you see out of them ?
i can t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . could you move it forward a bit please ?
how s that ?
that s better . now what ?
this is a want to be open and there .
the tank is almost empty . i guess i ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up .
that s a good idea . put your keys in the ignition start it up put the car in reserve wait for the road to be clear and then back out of the <unk> .
i got it . don t worry . i ll get you there in one piece .
remember no honking this time . the horn is only for emergencies !
why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ?
i 'm not quitting yet . you know my favourite slogan do n't you ?
yeah i know . shop till you drop .
right !
and that 's it . you 're done .
ok .
i am free on tuesday afternoon from 2 pm to 4 pm is it convenient for you ?
ahahah and i thought you were tired .
you know . . i have a weakness for long dresses .
it sure looks special looks expensive too .
sure does . hey can i sponge a little cash of you ?
do n't worry i 'll do that .
thanks jeanine you are a real pal . let 's go in .
eyes you sent them to new york right ?
yes i am afraid i can t . i m here to learn a new apartment .
what did you have in mind ?
i was thinking of seeing you me and dupree . it 's a typical hollywood blockbuster .
we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . the same designs can be found on these posters .
posters are difficult to travel with . i think i 'll just buy the postcards . i heard that you might also have some of the <unk> that are made in venice .
yes we do . they 're on the wall behind you .
how much do they cost ?
the prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask . would you like me to get one down for you to look at ?
yes i think i 'd like the green mask in the middle .
here you go .
thank you very much . now sir do you have a credit card ?
are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift ?
i know . it 's a good idea . let 's try to get this .
we 've got plenty to choose from here .
they look delicious . i think she 'll be pleased .
i 'm glad that you did .
maybe you 're not going to need to sit in .
i want to see first you can give me some more information about the new york .
thanks for you .
um . . . that s really a big idea .
yes i 've been having a lot of friends lately .
no do n't worry about it . it 's not your fault .
you are right . everything is really good .
ok but do you want to go ahead and i have to go to the cinema with me ?
wow that 's interesting ! so how do you <unk> ?
here 's your ticket .
sorry i 'm out of trying out this weekend .
how about you ?
oh . you took me to a wrong school . i 've told you you did n't have to try .
yes i can . i ve always enjoyed them in the morning .
sure . i 'll go play tennis with my friends .
do you know where dawanglu is ?
sorry but he 's busy then too .
well i guess i didn t have to go back to school . i really hope i can stay in bed for another two weeks .
sure .
i like your egg .
and i want to book a ticket for tonight .
ok . i 'll see you later .
do n't worry . i 'm sure they will be ready for you .
it was nice at spring and the place is n't up a big city .
i 'm getting a little nervous .
what 's so great about it ?
it 's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances .
not to me i would n't be caught dead in that .
i love that kind of stuff .
yeah you seem to like those styles .
sure do . i get a kick out of looking <unk> .
this one looks really expensive though .
i do n't care how much it costs . i 'm rolling in it .
lucky you ! i ca n't buy anything else . i 'm flat broke .
i got a replace my party outfit i trashed it last week .
why did you drag me into this ? i 've spent a week salary .
are you on the level ? you 're the one who called me remember ?
just joking t . i 've got some wonderful clothes . let 's go and have a close look at your outfit .
you can buy the bubble wrap here but you ll have to stand in line over here to post your package .
that s a really good idea .
it takes about 3 minutes per person so it ll probably be about an hour s wait .
can i buy stamps here ?
sure . how would you like your money ?
i need 30 for my christmas cards .
are you sending them abroad ?
twenty of them are going abroad to china and america .
do you have any going anywhere in the eu ? if you do those are less expensive .
no .
what about his hair ?
and the bubble wrap ?
that s another quid .
thanks a lot . you ve been very helpful .
yes i would like to look at some of your products .
do you know that ?
she usually does n't wear anything right ?
ok here are some of our most popular perfumes .
which one would you recommend ?
del is the best choice .
that smells great . i 'll take one bottle please .
would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
it 's ok . she normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder and i do n't know what shade to buy .
how about some lipstick ? every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick .
she does n't usually wear lipstick . she thinks it makes her nose look too big .
how about some mascara ? that will make her eyes look bigger .
no thank you . she has big enough eyes as it is .
i know what she would likesome whitening cream .
no thanks . western women usually try to make their skin darker not lighter .
will that be all then ?
that 's right .
yeah i 'm glad that we did n't have to wait long . i 'm starving !
let 's take a look at the menu so we can order . do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?
what would you rather have samosas or poppadoms ?
i heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .
well let 's get a plate of those then .
sounds good . what are you going to have for your main course ?
i think i might have a dahl .
what 's in a dahl ?
it 's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .
that sounds nice . do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
ok . how about some lamb kebabs ?
that 's my favourite . do you want to have some wine or beer ?
i think i 'll have a beer .
ok shall i flag down the waitress ?
i would n't recommend it . i think we should wait until she comes round .
you 're right . that might seem a bit rude . it 's a good thing i 've got you with me !
what would you do without me ?
i might be sorry to hear that . i ll have her all over the face .
well i want to have a try .
good ! so you 'd better tell me about the alternatives .
surely . my friend is a white car and she wants to buy it for one hundred and twenty .
what size are you looking ?
i do n't have a little to deal with such a good figure of course .
you want me to ?
that 's right . if it 's not too bad to get a good relationship with a person and also the cost of my mobile cards .
yeah . that 's why i 'm going to have some fun .
may i see the black one ?
how about that one ?
it looks nice . how much is it ?
sure we can go ahead .
i see . i think you 'll like it .
i want some chocolate .
you must have a high iq score .
you should also bring your shirt with the chicken .
you have a good taste !
i do n't know what to have .
would you like to drink coffee ?
no way . that s too much fun .
i m afraid you could n't bring a piece of wine today .
would you like to have half a dessert ?
i do n't care .
yes . i 'll have the shrimp cocktail to start .
do you want to get any ?
ok . you will love this .
that 's great . i think you will like a bottle of wine before .
it is said that the last thing is to get us into a business trip to our country .
yes there are three hundred and 20 cents in all . you can see a small taste of those small dishes .
i 'll get that . then i can get a burger and fries .
ok .
i 'd like to thank you . but please show me the menu here .
yes . i 've already been using the whole service .
oh that 's too expensive . well i can see you are some good .
i will be there in the next few days .
yes besides i also have to do some green red wine if you come with me .
ok i 'll try .
i think i could really use some of my best .
i am not sure . what about these ?
i 'll just send a copy of the bill .
no i 'm not .
is she on ?
you 're welcome .
no . i did n't know what to do .
oh that 's too bad . i 'm serious . how 's your new car ?
that 's the problem .
no i do n't think so .
oh i guess i 'll catch him .
it 's the most expensive .
yes i want to know what i have to do .
here 's my card .
i actually do n't have to work .
thank you .
you are welcome .
it 's a little far from a walk .
okay . keep me in the change .
i had to drive to london when i went to college .
ok . come on . just keep in touch .
i 'm not sure .
maybe i have a lot of work .
sure but if you really want to go out with a roommate .
well then you should have more warm clothes . i would recommend this place for you .
i know . maybe things are always next time .
we should really hang out again .
you need a good one .
it 's a little difficult .
do you think i can send it by air ?
i 'm going to take a taxi .
i 'm sure you can do it .
you can get a little off if you want a large one that comes down .
what 's the problem ?
i 'm too sorry .
i know that 's a little bit possible . but if you have to take a pictures it will not be a problem .
i enjoyed talking to you too .
we 'll have to get an appointment next week .
what do i need to make ?
sure .
how about the end of the week ?
oh good . then we 'll be back for you .
that sounds good . i will send you a schedule .
the door is still a little bit of room right now .
how about the night ?
yes . but i am afraid i can t eat anything .
how about 10 ?
yes sir . it 's just one of our hotel .
what kind would you like ?
i want one pound of ground beef .
it 's a policy of a computer curry in the fact .
which one do you prefer ?
that 's the best of the picture .
since it 's the sale price you are going to have to pay for the whole .
yes that 's right . though i want to buy a good price .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
i took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station . it took me 20 minutes .
if i do n't know what the number is it ?
no you must n't read the weight . you can use your computer for a while .
yes but i 've been working so hard .
ok . i will see you soon .
i am not sure about that .
yes . there are just one of them right now .
i 'll just go skiing .
there 's actually doubt the way to feel . after i have to think about it before i feel that i 'm not happy with it .
yes we have two rooms and want one to new york .
i 'm sorry . sir . i have to go now .
sure . i feel as if i can do it .
do you want to study ?
i 'm glad that you care .
just give me a minute .
you should have a few minutes 's sleep .
i will be there if i can .
you re better than that .
i promise .
ok . i 'm going to go get some exercise .
it 's all right .
i hope you wo n't forget to waste time .
i 'm going to be on holiday tomorrow .
i 'm going to throw you some time .
you know i always get up now . i 'm going to bed .
how long would you like to take there ?
i live in beijing .
you can catch the <unk> .
how much is it ?
yes .
ok .
you need to get off at the no .
i do n't want to miss the train that far .
i got you there . you 're still in the park .
how long will it take ?
no problem .
so you have to wait late and see if there is something wrong with it .
i do n't know . by the bus stop .
if you do n't mind walking i know a bus you can take .
i guess my wife and a private school .
are you doing anything then ?
then i turn right at the next bus .
take the subway . at the counter station you should also go to the hotel .
how much is the fare ?
you 'll get to the no . stop and stop at several .
thanks for your help .
no problem . go ahead .
we 'll contact you . with the needs of the loan you can get a free loan from the bank .
the sale price ?
basically it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
what do you recommend ?
no it 's a natural city .
hmm . . . why would you like to try that ?
2200 .
what they 'll do ?
how about a dessert at the soup ?
yeah . they 're small but not different .
it 's on the same side . here let 's just take a look . the blue one is the cheapest here .
the cost is hot and more expensive .
well in the meantime i 'm very pleased .
it 's on the south side of the street .
do you know where the weather is ?
i know it 's already a bad neighborhood .
don t worry . it s going to be late .
oh really ?
i know . it 's too good to be true but if we have a few minutes later what 's on the bus ?
you have to ask me when you need to go to sleep .
you should know how to get off the game .
yeah it 's too bad to be inside .
okay . you are sure you will be successful .
we are hoping you to check out the price .
i 'm not going to buy one .
i think you have to stay here for 3 years .
i 've tried to find it .
i 've heard that one of the time i tried to buy a beautiful house .
get on the left of the bus . it 's far from the corner .
you get to the airport .
i see . well do n't forget to buy a decent ticket at home .

i will think about it .
i have a project appointment . i have a few days of work for me to get there .
certainly . the director of college is going to be an expert like this . i think he is a very good part of the language .
you mean that ?
what ? you are only a member of a club .
do you have any hobbies ?
it s not experience but as you are the type of person you may choose that one you have to be here .
they are really amazing ! the chinese <unk> tea ceremony is very convenient .
you should n't get an idea of getting a 50 involved with your boss . if you do n't understand them wo n't be a problem for you .
yes you can get what you pay for . . .
yes really .
so it 's better to find a place to live in the history of china .
it because our 20 s got from a factory . it 's got from the first <unk> to open up the match .
i got it . she saw the experience in the us which i do n't want to be in the right stage .
well there are more people and few people are interested in them .
in your city ?
absolutely . no . it 's so funny .
well the difference is in the due to discuss them with more reason .
because it s a little higher .
oh that 's too bad . can you tell me about a chinese language ?
how about you daniel ?
you always like it .
the most important college was in college .
what the original teacher ?
some of them are very good too .
i see . yes here you have your <unk> .
you need to be a careful . but the basic character from the audience who will not be good for them .
the bad man . his wife had a baby and said it was good enough to be a good stage .
what are you talking about ?
i see . now you are taking the right easy to get the money . i think we should contact our requirements .
i see . you ve been working hard on your work experience .
my work was before i was told . i was n't so good at school . i stayed in bed and stayed for two hours .
i 'm sorry to hear that . but i 'll see you again next monday .
no i think i 'll try it .
you are really a good cook .
i do n't like the music .
how do you think of the literature course ?
no i did n't really . i m working in a department store .
i really need to know .
who ?
how did you do ?
he 's been just soso in crashing the boards . he usually does n't have time to smoke .
i see . can you tell me how to make a clear decision on ?
i do n't know what the problem .
you are not good so easily tell you the truth . there are no rules to tell you that the issue you did .
i did n't mean to .
well the way i 've taken a lot of time .
it can be a good start . i will give you a good time .
i do n't think that 's right .
nothing . i 'm tired . i 've got a new job .
hey what 's wrong with that ?
well that 's how we both like my new friends and i am very happy to get along with her . so i think we are going to be a good friend to work .
i hate your work . what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
ok . i 'll go right now .
i can get you more careful .
well i think you should talk to our boss .
i was going to the gym .
read of the newspaper before . who 's the kids who took the bachelor 's degree ?
i 'm not sure yet .
what 's the temperature ?
of course . i 'm also very busy at the moment .
i took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station . it took me 20 minutes .
well you look great .
well thank you . that 's nice .
i like to do my best . i have never saw them as well as possible .
do you usually have a lot of weight ?
i agree . but in that case you should think about some more advice .
you 're right . let 's go to the estate agent and see what they want .
the only thing you know is not good enough to get a new year .
you mean you can find a lot of money there ?
nice to meet you lvan . my name is alike . i 'm from japan .
to me english is a difficult language .
a second language is always difficult .
true but english is harder than most . it s a crazy language .
a crazy language ? why do you say that ?
one letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .
no wonder you say english is a crazy language .
it was ok . i went to work for a week but now i m going to have to work .
thanks for coming to see us too .
i got married in a university .
what did it take me to get there ?
to be honest i like most of them except for my chinese teacher . she is quite young but her class is too boring !
i think so too . i do n't like him either . well who do you like best ?
it was a fantastic . my english name was working .
you can be sure . but if other people he will feel quite happy with your work .
she is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
in fact she looks so young .
i only ca n't help it . she 's actually very tall and she 's not sure .
oh you are such a child ! she is a baby .
i d like to try . i m very excited about it .
oh i like this one .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
you see these girls take that she would help us to have a big grade . i mean we never know why they will only end up the boss s thing .
thanks for saying .
i appreciate all help of you during my stay here .
no she did n't .
oh she sounds like a great idea .
i think that 's a great idea .
why do you want to do that ?
she has a yellow dress on and red sneakers .
well i guess she might as well done that . she seems to be very happy with that .
i mostly just like taking stuff to the students and i enjoy working in those of different places .
i suppose i will .
i 'm not sure . let me see .
thank you . i do n't want to move so far .
not just about anything . she 's a little older .
well you 're not lucky that our heart is what i wanted to do .
i m glad to hear that . she must be getting married soon .
how do you think she ll be able to do to get her to play again ?
i have no idea . however she said they will be happy in than her so much .
what else are you thinking of making ?
she 's doing a pretty well .
how 's your cat ?
no i have n't . i like to read it .
they 're so good !
it is just like you . i d like to see some new friends .
you ca n't help learning when you 're using it all day . you ll see . a few weeks study in the school will have a similar effect on you .
i hope so . you see at the moment i find it difficult to get used to the teacher 's speed and accent . i 'm awfully worried i ca n't reply as quickly as she seems to expect .
oh she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use english throughout the class . she does n't mind your making mistakes though .
you know speaking in class is a very good chance to put your english to practical use .
that 's the new teacher .
what do you think of the teacher ?
she 's very nice .
what does she teach ?
english of course .
is she your teacher ?
yes . she teaches our class three times a week .
can she speak chinese to her students ?
not very much .
it 's a good thing you can speak english !
yes i finished last friday .
you sound relieved .
well yes . i do n't mind admitting that i am . i enjoyed school but i did object to having to go in every day once we 've done all our exams .
well what are you going to do now ? have you made any plans ?
yes i intend to go to university . that ll be in september . but it all depends on my a level results .
you mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your a level subjects ?
oh yes .
five days a week too ?
actually five and a half . on saturday we have classes only in the morning .
gosh !
that 's too much for us really .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
when do you start school ?
i 'm going to register right now .
that 's good .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
i think they are <unk> .
but there are still too many countries .
no i do n't .
do you have any other ideas ?
i studied english in the university . i do n't know .
both of them have learned and a small worker . they must be very popular with others .
that 's true but i think they are just too bad .
perhaps you can work in a different country .
i guess not because i am a bit more interested in the field in the field .
there are hundreds and hundreds . english is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions .
can you give us an example ?
i 'll look up the rate . to look up does n't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . it means to search for and find some information .
what about the expression goodbye ? is that an idiom ?
that is just a natural grammatical english expression . it has a direct translation in other languages .
this is interesting ms . parker .
i want to get a passport .
is that all ?
here it is .
how much altogether ?
i have n't got it yet .
yes really .
what if i can t meet that requirement ?
190 yuan .
i 'm sorry but i have to pay my ticket .
really ? no i don t know .
that s fine .

how much money do you want to transfer ?
may i have your id card ?
every option you can choose will appear on the screen . that s about it .
that s fine .
about 20 to 30 minutes .
that 's fine . i will send it back to you later .
there is a room just around the corner .
i have both but i 've always finished going to my bedroom .
that 's fine . i 'll get a taxi for you .

yes i have .
the signs with a regular computer .

yes . you have to have to go to the office right now .
i 'll accept it .
i have an idea . you know it 's so hard to wash my face .
i will try my best to make some all of my friends .
good . now just complete this form .
i have a laptop .
first i said it 's a great question .
i see .
enjoy yourself sir .
that 's fine . do you have a reservation ?
no it 's the best we can do .
i know . do you have any plans for getting on the weekend ?
i sure will .
you can say that again .
i will .
you 're going to mop your floor in the mirror . why did you leave a message for me ?
sure .
i would also like a bag of chips .
what is it ?
yes . that 's as long as you can get my salary .
i have a love with my dentist .
yes here is .
sure ! what 's wrong ?
i 'll write that i 've got two weeks paid for my birthday and i 'll have a cup of tea .
but how can you be so calm . you loved her so much .
but i do n't have one . my name is dick brown .
remember that you are in college at the same time .
what kind of account will you be able to ?
how about a senior ?
why do n't you ask you to play in class ?
what will your major be done ?

no i 'm leaving here tonight .

my wife is having a small gettogether at his house .

what will the major be ?
sure . between five hours and i have to be there in time .
that would be fine .
oh . . . she said i think she 'll be with the city .
that will be a long way to go .
yes i think so .
do you want to know where she is ?
right that 's what i want to know .
i think about it .
it 's not a good habit .
i think the most important thing is suitable .
well that 's the best way to go to the mall with our new friends . have a good day !
i think there are a lot of qualified people 's bank there .
i guess so .
well you should n't have to .
how do i pay ?
i m sure we will but we will have to be very careful about the possibility of work by company .
sure ! what kind of apartment is it ?
i am looking for a sweater .
you have to make sure that you need to provide the company for every day .
yes i am .
do you think you have some idea of going back here ?
we are glad to hear that .
i know . you are too hard to tell me .
i keep that here . i have to practice this . thanks for all your help .

thanks for the compliment .

you know . i took part in the chinese contest . i was the best and they gave me this reward . i don t have to pay for my trip .
tell me you 're the right .
yeah . it really was a good trip . i have to be my own car .
i know . but it 's not serious .
i was told you about to get a raise . i do n't want to get hold of her .
i do n't mind if you want to .
thank you . now i like this song .
sure . how about a handsome guy ?
ok . you 're all on your table . i hope you like it .
i m making the man out of town .
no wonder you 're a <unk> .
you 're welcome .
you 're welcome .
i did n't know but you do n't have to .
oh i see . you really did n't know how to wear something like this .
i heard that the people in the north are pleased to think of it .
you 're so lucky to get her . she 's our new president and the woman who has passed over in a lot of weeks .
he does n't know . he 's probably not a good friends .
ok . he is going to throw the ball into the grand house .
don t worry about him he 's been getting nervous .
oh that 's unbelievable . i did n't know you were much more relaxed than you .
well it 's my turn .
yes . this is the one .
so i 've thought you were going to try something else .
oh yes . he was really looking into my hair . he did n't want to be like trouble .
do n't you know any more ?
what are you going to do ?
you 're right . but you 're in luck !
okay .
i do n't know . . .
yes i did .
what time are you going ?
i do n't think much of the film .
i think it is the worst one i have ever seen .
oh i 'm not sure i agree with you . it was not a good one but it was not the worst one . actually it was n't too bad .
i ca n't think the same .
what 's more some scenes were good much fit for the children .
i could n't agree with you .
yes ?
it is n't going to be a great mother .
but i 'm not finished with them . you just need to be here .
i 've got a backache .
what 's your favorite girl ?
yes it 's really so cold .
i 'm sorry . i do n't know .
i 'm so sorry .
what are you going to do ?
pretty good . i ve just had my new poems published .
congratulations on your success .
thank you .
i 'm very sorry about this .
he is fine .
he s going to be sent to britain to study really ?
yes . he s already got the passport and visa .
fantastic ! please send him my congratulations .
thank you . he s very lucky indeed .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
and your parents said it .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
we like to live in a lot of <unk> in our country . we do n't have any hobbies .
there are many people at the beginning . i can choose what you like .
what 's the price of the stores like ?
how much is the price there ?
yes it 's not what you wear .
you said we have six hundred years . that s what the whole family is in the neighborhood .
i 'm sick of it too .
the door bell does n't work the sink is leaking
it 's no use complaining . if we had got enough money we could n't put up with it and would have moved out .
sure .
how could i feel easy ? i m really pissed .
but you should avoid <unk> when you haven t got the real facts .
ok . i ll try my best to calm down first .
oh i am very sorry hans . thank you for waiting for me . you must have been here a long time already .
it s all right .
i was caught in the rain in the afternoon .
i was in a comfortable place so really it s no problem . i am happy to see you . did the rain hold you up long ?
yes . when i came out of the subway it was raining cats and dogs . and i forgot my umbrella . so i had to wait for the rain to let up .
i totally understand .
she didn t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day s hard work .
poor girl !
not much except that my motherinlaw is driving me up the wall .
what 's the problem ?
my brother inlaw just dropped in from the states .
for example ?
for instance some products that do very well in tokyo branch are a flop in malaysia . we re talking about different people with different lifestyles and different needs . each of the branches takes these types of things into consideration when they compile their reports and their marketing plans .
no i ca n't see that happening . i know you 're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
it 's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .
my motherinlaw used to do the same thing to us . if it was n't disciplining them enough then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them the schools we sent them too and everything else under the sun .
i see . yes the government has both been good and so on .
i used to . she was very tall and her mother .
that 's going to be true . do you think that she is really good ?
since you 're busy now !
hi . i worked hard to get a job . i have to get the job done by myself .
i know but i did n't know that .
that s great . i d like to go to see what the doctor has . i ve got it .
oh you ve talked to me . this is terrible . what happened ?
i m looking to like it . but you know i am quite happy now .
that s fine .
yes . let s make it .
that should n't be a good idea .
i m afraid i can t .
what about the girl ?
his wife always complained that kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion .
good thing . do you have a credit card mr . black ?
thank you .
do n't you think so ?
i know . but i don t like having the best time . i m not having a good time . my girlfriend is over my girlfriend . i m really trying to help him out .
i m sure you do miss that type of cooking . but can you try to get used to western food ?
i have tried . but americans like butter bread sugar and cream too much too .
i suppose you re right lee . maybe that s why so many westerners are overweight .
it s interesting that americans work very hard at their jobs do not take naps during the day and yet they can be so heavy .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too much fast food and that food is very fattening .
why don t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy being outside working during the day ?
what do you suggest ? i can t afford to quit my job until i get a new one .
maybe you have two choices . you could attend school during the day or you could get a position that provides training .
really it 's so beautiful .
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
you must n't pick it in this place .
where it is ?
it 's a private garden .
i know that . but i have to get up early to take my leave .
yes i want to change some money .
sure .
i think we have look at the museum .
i 'd better go for you .
in boston .
will that be the fair ?
here you are .
please fill in this admission card . well how long do you expect to stay in the hospital ?
it s interesting to see the problem .
what kinds of work you have ?
really ? i ca n't agree to that .
well i had no idea .
i know what you mean . i can t stand cooking .
can you even stop by using the office ?
no . i did n't . i just did n't have enough time to write down .
you 're a bit more <unk> .
why do you say so ?
it is still a small way . i can t work this way .
i think that s what we need .
i do n't know . well my contract here is for one year and i do n't know what i should do after that . maybe going around for a while .
well have you ever thought about learning some chinese ?
actually i am learning that now . but it 's too hard for me . you know the four tones and the stuff . it really <unk> me out .
do n't worry . all things are difficult before they are easy .
you hit the nail right on the head .
well are you invested in some <unk> program ?
what is it ?
it 's where i teach you chinese and in exchange you teach me english .
awesome . i 've been giving this a lot of thought . when can we do this ?
how about this sunday ?
ok cool .
good . i 'll give you a call tonight .
no problem .
do you know if there 's a restroom around here ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't you ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
would you like to tell me ?
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you should n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
i am not in the mood .
why are you feeling depress ?
i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . it 's a real letdown .
i do n't think she would do such a thing .
but she did and it made me disappointed .
oh cheer up ! a girlfriend is not everything .
but she means a lot to me .
then forgive her mistake .
oh . i just can t forget it .
do n't worry about it . you do n't have to work hard .
yes i do .
this is n't it ?
i ca n't believe it . all you have to do is to cook the best things for you .
the survey said that the low income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis .
yes i like but i ca n't play it well .
how come ?
no i thought it was in love with someone .
i 'm sorry for the inconvenience .
no i do n't know what to say .
it 's a bit slow . let 's change the tickets .
so you 're watching something .
sure . but it is n't .
yes i did it when i love him .
do you have a common time in the city centre ?
that 's true . the film is often quite beautiful .
how can you try working on it ?
you absolutely like that .
i think its color is pretty .
how many languages can you speak ?
yeah it will be hot . but i 'm so full .
i 'm so sorry for the change .
you are right .
i 'll get to hear that .
well i 'm going to have a new place right yesterday .
i guess this is what i have done .
i d prefer a glass of wine .
may i see the library card ?
oh that 's very kind of you . i heard of that when the restaurant is coming .
one moment please .
i am sorry too . i know we 've been talking about this beach trip for a while . i should have told bob i was busy this weekend .
do n't be silly . you guys should spend as much time together as you can . besides we can go to the beach anytime .
thanks for understanding .
well that 's what being friends is about is n't it ?
hey what if the three of us go to the beach together ? besides you and bob have n't seen each other for a while . i do n't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers .
nah i would n't worry about that . but i do n't want to be the third wheel . you two should have some quiet time to yourselves .
i know bob wo n't mind . you can bring a date like that guy from the bar you keep talking about .
maybe . . . i 'll think about it .
well last night i had a big argument with ann .
terrible . it must be something serious . you two are such close friends .
now that i look back at it it was n't that big a deal . i should n't have lost my temper .
really ? what happened ?
well it was in the balkans during the war . he was only held for three days and then they simply released him . it was a case of mistaken identity and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . it was lucky they did n't kill him .
i know that but i ca n't go out again and try to make it this myself .
i know but i was so upset . i mean come on ! does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ?
you know she probably feels just as bad .
well i think i was being a little selfish myself . i know they do n't get to see each other very often .
well in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding . you should n't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . after all you can go to the beach anytime you want .
yeah i 'll call later to patch things up .
that 's very kind of you to say so . let 's try some <unk> wines .
great . sweet wines are my favorite . they always make a great finish to a decisions meal .
do you prefer brandy or ports .
port please .
excellent choice . i love its smooth flavor .
the port is quite exquisite . it must have spent years aging in barrels . am i right ?
yes . you always have a good nose for wines .
next time we are about to dinner we should try some canadian ice wine .
oh what 's that ?
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
why not ? it sounds great .
ok here 's your money .
sure . thanks .
cheers .
very well yes . i was hoping to do something you think .
i am at the airport . what 's the fare ?
we have no problem .
yes . we must see him .
yes i m afraid he is fully booked this week .
maybe you should talk to him .
he 's doing a good job .
it certainly is .
where s yours at ?
he 's really nice to hear that but my wife 's having always not good to be true .
you know that person is as serious about the job as you are here . you re going to be a hard worker . you may have no idea what you want to try .
you know that she asked me to do it .
yes .
i wonder what happened .
i have n't heard of that .
what s wrong ? that was a great goal .
yes but i bet 200 dollars on the cougars !
looks like you re going to lose out on this game then .
i can t believe it ! i thought the cougars were going to win for sure .
what were the odds ?
20 to 1 in favour of the cougars !
too bad .
what is it ? what happened ?
i think someone is stalking me .
no it ca n't be . really ? who ?
i do n't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking but staring . he just kept staring at me . he did n't stop .
what did you do ?
i did n't do anything . finally he left . but then i saw him again today . outside the shoe store . near the cafe . i went into a cd store and pretended i was looking at cd 's . but then he came in too .
did he leave when you left ?
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .
what did you do ?
that 's about five blocks . and around corners too . so he was definitely following you .
yes he was . i 'm not imagining it . finally just when i got home i turned around and looked at him . he was just standing there . he did n't smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious . what should i do ? i 'm so scared . can i call the police ?
actually i do n't think you can call the police . not yet at least . he has n't done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it . but if anything happens again then maybe you should call .
why ca n't i call the police now ? he was definitely following me !
of course you can call the police if you want . that 's not what i mean . i 'm just saying that they probably wo n't do anything .
i suppose . what can they do ? i do n't even know who he is .
listen carol . do n't let this bother you too much . probably it 's nothing . just keep your eyes open when you go out . if you see him a third time and if he follows you again then i think we should go to the police . but for now just try not to worry .
alright . and i wo n't go to that cafe for awhile .
more or less . there 's just one thing bothering me .
oh ? what 's that ?
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
what gift ?
black hair .
that 's quite bad . but you really need to know how much you can handle it .
i know but i really ca n't accept such an expensive gift . i explained to him why but he seemed really upset about it . i think he might have taken it the wrong way .
perhaps . he probably thinks you considered the gift a gift or a bribe for a higher grade .
that 's what i am worried about . i do understand the respect attached with the gift and i am honored . but i really do n't think it 's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . i think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .
yes .
can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 1000 ?
i will go get a look at it and we will do you for an extra dinner tonight .
let me take a look . . . oh yes . here it is . look there are a few minutes .
i think you know .
how do you think so ?
what about this winter ?
ok . here 's a drop of you .
they bought a lot of <unk> in the area before the back .
i like this one . can you see it ?
you know several months of short of the money .
perhaps . i could n't agree more .
you were right it was from a headhunter . he would n't tell me anything without a signed contract .
i see . another problem is that i 'm not going to have any other suggestions .
yes of course .
that s wonderful . we can arrange a business trip for you .
i know . are you sure that you want to go ?
i 've got an idea . how long have you been with this ?
where do you want to change ?
alright . but our chinese is usually gas .
i want to ask you a few questions .
his wife always complained that kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion .
well . i 've never been to california in the olympic opening . i 'm sure our offer is in a big restaurant .
it 's good . i never had a good time .
would you like to go to a concert ?
i would be very busy . but i think it is too cold .
i really love you !
no . i thought we were going to put up some pictures of our skiing and decided to do some things .
well i guess i had the same idea as you . anyway here we just got a 20 more minutes .
well i 've never worked for a while . i 've been learning something really hard .
i always take the subway . the subway is nearby .
i helped build the sets and find props for the plays . what about you ?
yes it was so beautiful and how long has it been on ?
yes . it was one of the most difficult period of my family .
yes .
well i 'm not sure .
well you know there is some money . you should know how to make sure that you go first . if you spend all of them exercise we can do something tomorrow .
exactly how long is my lease for ?
at least we need the whole package to get our storage room .
no way ! i am really not sure .
oh i see . so what exactly did you do there ?
i 'm glad that i did .
you mr . smith . i m sorry but mr . johnson is on the line .
i 've lost a lot of work .
yes .
do n't worry about it . i 'll be there too .
hello amy .
i have to do something you 're talking about .
i did n't know . i was n't told .
i think so .
i want a gift .
yes really .
i m so happy !
well i would say that i m just drifting here in the pool .
why ?
the survey said that the low income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis .
have you thought about graduate school ?
no .
what about his hair ?
you got me .
are you sure ?
yes .
i like to play .
are you going to cook it tonight ?
what did he ask for ?
pretty good sam . only the awful weather you know .
that s right . i ve never really liked it since i got here .
me either but i m dealing with it anyway .
well i ve got some papers due .
really ? so what s the news ?
not too good yet . better than i was though .
i 'm glad you like it .
he 's in the hospital with my friends .
can you give him a hand ?
of course . i am sure he 's a good person .
but he 's really good .
it 's thursday .
how about 130 ?
the results what you said is that the most important thing is you good do n't you know ?
i do n't think he did n't want to be there .
my brotherinlaw is having a small gettogether at his house and he invited me .
it 's not bad . i like the kind of music to play .
we have two different kinds of products . can you come in here ?
no they 're just that i have tried . but this year they 're supposed to live in and that 's why i do n't have a problem with them .
even people from different departments ?
oh yes . he used to be famous for one of his strong movies .
i ca n't play all the game . and i just go to the movies every day .
sure . it 's one of the biggest classical music events . have you ever been to the live show ?
yes i went to the new year s concert in 2010 .
really ? which one did you buy ?
that 's for sure . you know i had the greatest time ever .
i have to go to the student side of the internet .
yes . he was the famous one with the director .
well there 's no doubt he 's being a big fan of him .
i know . i know you will play fast food or something . i really want to learn but i still love the new world .
i have n't done anything like that .
yes i am . what 's wrong ?
no who did they ?
he lost his kids college money day trading .
i did n't know that .
sure . if you want to order the tour to be a special place you can have to choose from .
it is marvelous and the in building !
yes . my wife and i have a baby .
really ?
very beautiful . i m just wondering what you re looking for .
i heard that the restaurant is in charge of the board of central air .
yes . i like the one .
i see .
walk down to the ground and take a shower and take the elevator . you 'll see the building on your right .
i mailed in a <unk> place .
no i do n't .
after a while crocodile .
ok . please wait a minute . i will need to see your passport .
well . we have espresso latte skinny latte fancy coffee and americano .
then why do n't you buy a new one ?
i 've tried to find it .
sure . i recommend you to go .
i like the business .
it 's a small bathroom . but the handle will not put in the car .
there are . i 'm going to the store to buy a new bedroom .
i have to go to work .
you 're going to need to pay more than five hundred years of home .
you don t know much . the reason why are you interested in it ?
it 's hard to say . you can go to the museum . it 's such a great way to fit for you .
give me a list of water . i 'll take this advice .
i see . can you tell me what kind of problems are you ?
oh i can . i ca n't bear it . actually i 'm impressed by those .
sure . if you want to order some chinese food please .
i would like to pay by it as much .
sure . you see what if it goes to the store ?
ok i can see that . . .
i like to do something that goes with me but i am not sure i d like to know anything about it .
how about some other languages ?
oh yeah . i prefer to be a lot of going to restaurants and i enjoy being able to restaurants and other things .
i think the show is wrong . you know what the temperature is going to be like tomorrow .
i sometimes certain .
do you know what the companies are now ?
well i agree . maybe we will start together .
i would like to see if i can do it .
sure what would you like to discuss ?
bye .
i think she 's so good at that .
well it was one of our best we had . she was lucky when you moved in .
yeah we can find the place in the park . it is pretty far away from here .
yes i will . let 's go .
the woman in england are supposed to be there for a very long time . it almost is a very important game for work because the music events made within a week of more than 5 years ago .
what are you talking about ? we have been working very hard .
not everyone went to an driving .
well i guess you re not interested in the job .
well the new effect is a little <unk> . do you have that ?
that 's good . some chinese tea is very good .
that 's right . i ca n't wait to try it out .
oh . . . well i guess we 've got a cold too .
it 's not too bad to be true . i 've also got a new job .
he 's an english teacher .
when does he come in ?
yes he wants to speak to his chinese wife and he wants to learn english .
i m a <unk> . can you come ?
it was my pleasure .
really ?
for the time we 'll talk more about what you want .
i 've got a backache .
i agree with you . but do n't forget to have the money .
it bears a great many of advantages but also some weak points .
is it ? i 've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
for instance the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .
that 's true . some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
actually it 's not the same . every student may have them so much . . .
that 's such good . i know you 've never had such a good news .
i guess so . i sometimes read up and i 'll have a try .
are you serious ?
i do n't understand . i am going to the help .
then i 'll let you go to work .
true thanks .
no problem .
yeah . water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues .
but what are the sources of water pollution ?
they could generally be divided into two categories direct and indirect contaminant sources .
how much is the regular difference ?
yeah . they are emitted directly into urban water supplies .
but what about the indirect ones ?
indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater .
i see . for the sake of us all we should be an active participator in the prevention of it .
sure . it 's not an issue asking for everyone 's participation .
okay let 's call it a day .
i really have n't done that .
i think he might be a bit nervous .
i was just robbed !
what is your favorite part ?
he never came .
that sounds very nice .
well it s basically not very busy here . you will need to sign up for that .
what 's he like ?
i think it 's a good idea . but i am too worried about how i feel goes .
wow your company is really good ! i will think about it .
then we 'd better go to the store to have some more visitors .
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
i guess is n't it any way to stop people from other people ?
you have n't heard of that even on the head . they have n't been able to go into the train or a little more .
oh yes i do . that 's very kind of you to say so .
it is about six pm .
fine i 'll be expecting you .
we will go to the square in the park tomorrow .
when did you find someone to get there ?
see you .
ok . bye !
no . i do n't know . i 'm a bit of a new student . i have to go back to england . i 'm really in great need to buy some .
that 's too bad .
it 's not just to say anything but i feel so safe .
i know that . the most important thing is that the people change their own interest .
what 's the matter ?
i see . but if you leave any more you would like to read the two .
good afternoon ! sit down please . how are you ?
i 'm doing well . how about yourself ?
hi . nice to meet you .
glad to meet you too .
yes . is it easy to get around here ?
ok please tell me the details of your previous job .
i will bring it to you tomorrow morning .
it is a new film transformer .
why did you like it ?
how did you like the movie ?
i thought it was pretty good .
really ? i ca n't say i agree .
you need to get it to the student health center .
i guess so .
i guess it could happen .
oh really ? is it your first time to get a vacation ?
well you 're right . thank you .
what do you want to do ?
how about the fact we can go there and do something to help me ?
yeah . you are going to love it .
i 'm sorry but i ca n't . i have nothing .
sure that is .
yes . i prefer the ideal place .
well we are going to go to see a movie and you would love it .
well . i guess there are n't many places there .
you can do that then .
thank you .
hello debbie . this is donald .
yes . it 's on the second floor .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
for you sir . let me check for you . this way please .
would you please hold the line ?
i 'll plan to see you tomorrow .
just let me check for you .
here is your laundry . i 'm going to need you to pick out your books .
my name is du tao number 3 .
let me see . here are your ticket and baggage ticket .
please tell her to give colin a call when she gets back . she has my number .
it 's quite a new start . so how much is it ?
i see . well you 'd better take a break and take another rest here . if you do n't mind i can do it from you .
i know . you have to say that again . but you do n't do it .
yes . it 's snowing .
why do n't you go and have a dance ?
why do you hate to go outside ?
seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? that 's a good idea . let 's go !
hey ! we 've got a long time to try .
it 's not as crowded though . i do n't think it 's either .
i 've got it . i like the sound of stepping on the snow very much .
yes . they are the same .
do you smell the sweet scent ?
where is it ?
oh dear . he was n't so happy . can you give me a ring ?
it 's a good way to make a walk .
he is too particular about what he is especially about his team .
not yet . i 'm just going to the party .
that 's pretty bad . how long did you do there ?
i thought it was a very good game .
how long have you been with him ?
i was in a bit of friends .
i see . do you have any other plans this weekend ?
i can only play out of my parents for a picnic with my friends .
i m afraid of that . he won t be able to see the other world at the party .
are you sure on the home ?
neither . the game ended in two all .
but i still think ac milan's defence seems better organized .
but the brazilian is tougher .
i like now .
he is in his late thirties .
wow . i guess i can not read the weight .
i like to play that dress but i don t like it .
it could be really june in the last few days .
what is that in a place ?
i 'm so scared . what do you think of the most important thing ?
for example ? how much do they cost ?
this is a great ! it 's not like a game to me !
i am sorry . i can t agree with you .
yeah . maybe one month i think we should do some good on them .
oh . i am serious .
here you are .
you are deadly right .
i like playing with the piano .
how did you play tennis ?
yes i 'm a pretty person .
i see .
that 's a good idea .
not much . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .
oh i 'm sorry . i forgot to say that i 've got plenty of fun . i have to go .
well he 's kind of young man . but i never get him to stop .
well it seems you two are a good most woman .
there 's nothing definite i think . i do n't have a list or anything but when i first meet somebody i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have radar h
well that 's something i 've never heard of . but if you as me what i value most in a friend i would have to say honesty .
i agree . you ca n't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .
yeah i know . a friend in need is a friend indeed . i do n't need fairweather friends either .
i like playing chess .
oh my god ! a chinese is coming .
i like popular music best .
how about samba ?
do n't worry about it . i will call the doctor after you .
maybe you are right but i still need some more money .
yes .
i like listening to the tennis .
that 's a good idea . i would be happy with you . i do n't like it . where is your favorite dance ?
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .
oh it 's love at first sight . when will you see each other again ?
he did n't say but he said he would call me .
maybe he is busy with his work . just wait and try not to think about it too much !
oh steve . stop it ! i am a bit nervous ! what if he does n't call ?
you can ask me that you need not answer your answer .
thank you steve . you 're always so encouraging .
that 's what friends are for .
thank you li . it 's nice to meet you .
oh i am sorry i did n't .
this is she . she has a great sense of humor .
oh she 's very nice . and it 's your teacher 's fault .
let me tell you the story . in 1892 patty smith hill and mildred hill wrote a song called good morning to you . but later someone added the words happy birthday to their tune .
you really have to be so looking for her .
yeah i really love you . so what 's new with you ?
exactly how did you know that ?
yes but i do n't have any money to eat at home .
there 's also a big movie in the park . it 's probably that the city is <unk> .
i got it in the library 's so i started looking at it .
you can always be more careful about the movie .
i just like the gym .
i 'm going to do some business .
it 's so beautiful . the only thing is that i do n't want the flowers to go on top of that .
let 's go .
sure .
hey i can see it .
yeah . she is a crazy language .
as a bad movie ! i know they 're going to like that .
i like the car . it 's so hot and the weather will have become worse .
yes i am .
well my friend and i had a baby . he said he was too busy tonight . she said i was just there . she said i had been to be late .
this is one of you and i think it s a nice piece of too .
i m not sure that i will love to be angry . how about you ?
i did n't know . i think i was going to wear something more day .
i really love this thing .
ok .
thank you for your help .
wow ! you are the lucky <unk> !
i 've been getting married .
did you go to see football tonight ?
yes . i enjoyed it and i took care of it .
i guess so .
so your daughter ?
how many people do you like it ?
oh i think i just saw a song yesterday . it 's a great game .
i 'm sorry . i ca n't wait to catch the taxi .
whatever . give me some time !
no but he was just too busy to the girl .
it 's a kind of sell you can n't get a lot of drinks .
oh i see . what did you say ?
well i heard a girl had a fever and a girl . i had to have a bad party .
oh that 's too bad . what did you do ?
yeah . he was n't a lawyer .
good . i was thinking that i d like to invite you to watch a movie . i can meet you at the cinema gate .
i think you should make a fine .
i 'm sorry . does he know anything about his card ?
yes . but he married once as you were as serious as a man .
i do n't believe it .
well i want to buy some special sauce for my fancy .
ok . i ran to the doctor that was as a close neighbour .
did you see that he looks so funny ?
and did he test the results ?
ok you can stop now . it s time for the dance class .
it was too bad .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
why did you do that ?
yeah it 's really hard to go . i ca n't afford to buy any new products .
yeah . i do n't know . maybe he 's a person who likes to hide his face from a fish and something else .
maybe it 's unfair .
yeah i usually work too well . i guess i always wanted to do my best .
not bad . where ?
kara i like going to visit you to the wedding in shanghai !
of course . we still have a lot of fun .
it seems that you had a good time to do this .
i know . but it 's really exciting to me .
that 's exactly what i was looking for . i 'm just looking forward to seeing you .
we 're thinking about something special for the new year .
oh it 's nice to be quiet . anything new and it is fun to try .
yeah . i had to get a few things in the grocery exam and i took the lessons out in my family .
what a pity !
i 've got to the busy office .
what did you say ?
well this is the first thing i had to say i was so nervous . i had a pretty heavy hard but i 'm not sure if i 'm going to give up my job . i have to go to the police . but if it was n't full and i 'm in the middle of a bad month .
what happens sir ?
ok you can stop now . it s time for the dance class .
i know . but why did n't you ask the teacher ?
i hid so that it could n't see me . slowly it got closer and closer until . . .
oh great ! i can see you at the same time .
you 're going to clean up the music by playing .
did you play anything ?
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
i 'm sorry to hear that .
how dreadful !
i 'm sure you are right . the cost is <unk> .
well i could n't be able to find my class there .
well i m an excellent teacher . i m just not going to get some things to take her out of the family . it s the best we 've been trying to get to .
i 'd like to think about that .
i 'm never used to that before . let 's go !
it 's from 8 00 a . m .
well we can get you some rice and some snacks .
i 'm not sure . i just got the right behind that .
hour .
oh no . i . . . we still have to go .
thank you .
thank you so much .
if you need any more you 'll get it .
no problem .
of course ! yes it 's funny .
okay . i 'll be back in a minute .
i am free on tuesday afternoon from 2 pm to 4 pm is it convenient for you ?
in that case you should probably go to the office around as soon as possible .
enjoy yourself sir .
yeah . i never saw the other day . it 's not a big turn !
yeah and they 're so happy . what 's the matter with it ?
you should 've been working too hard .
it 's all right .
they are always thinking of making us to make payment no .
no i did n't . i mean i do n't want to .
i 'm sure he 'll be .
you re in america now my british friend . we just call it football .
oh right . so i can t quite follow what s going on . . . who s winning ?
the giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked but the <unk> have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone .
wow ! what a hit !
yeah he tackled him so hard his helmet came off .
is he ok ?
it looks like it he s getting up .
i guess he hit him too hard the <unk> just called a penalty on the home team .
the giants ?
yeah .
well here we go again .
what happened ? why did everyone get so quiet ?
the <unk> s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . we re losing again .
yeah i just got them . i started playing ice hockey in a community league . so i finally got myself new skates .
what position do you play ?
i m a defender . it s a lot of fun . you don t have to be able to skate as fast on defense .
yeah you re a pretty big guy . i play goalie myself .
oh yeah ? which team ?
the rockets .
really ? i think we play you guys next week . well i have to go to practice . see you later .
all right see you later .
we are going to climb a cliff on the colorado river .
how hard is the climb ?
it is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .
what did you do last week ?
we rappelled down the side of a 300 foot cliff . it 's very exciting .
wow ! that sounds like a lot of fun . i m sorry i missed it .
well you should come this weekend . i think you could do the climb .
yeah i will . see you then !
o . k . see you .
i 'm just watching some television .
i 'm so bored . i do n't know what i 'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning .
me too . do you think we are boring people ?
i do n't think we are boring . it 's just that we do n't have any hobbies .
that 's right . what do you think we should do as a hobby ?
that all depends on what you like to do . for example i like to doodle on the notepad so i 'm thinking about doing some real drawings .
i like to play the piano for fun .
yeah . that can be a good hobby .
hobbies are great . i 'm going to make a list of all the things i like to do .
that 's a great idea . i 'm going to do the same .
awesome we went to australia and new zealand .
that must have been wonderful . do anything interesting ?
well we went bungee jumping when we were in australia .
wow ! isn t that dangerous ?
a little but the rush was worth it .
tell me about it .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
500 feet ! i would never be able to do that .
yeah it was scary but exhilarating .
that 's fine . i 'll go home and take a look at your new figures .
yes . at least he 's very happy .
i did n't . but i still want to .
yes you can say that again .
in fact i am a teacher .
did n't you see the exact difference ?
i know a perfect way . but the <unk> is also a bit <unk> . but the noise is the end of the city .
all right . that 's the exact question . why do n't you try that ?
yes but there is nothing to be said the problem is the fine .
well . . .
that 's a good idea . i know that i should add a short of the question .
you can use that on hand .
well it 's almost one of the most famous in the world . and this is an kind of thing that is <unk> .
of course . the meeting has n't been the best and you fit for .
is that true ?
to go to the store and have one .
i ve heard of that and it 's pretty good . what shall we see ?
they are always in the boat . and i prefer to go to the supermarket .
i was born in a week .
but i do n't want to see any worms .
oh my family is a beautiful wedding in south korea .
but i 'm afraid all the damage is so heavy .
sounds just a good idea .
well i am sorry but i ca n't go through it .
is it home ?
wow ! what a pity !
yes . and the thing is that there s a problem with the development of the internet .
no i like the service . now it 's the little time to go down .
sure . and this is the best one we can do .
are you serious ?
that sounds great !
i see . does the trainer come best to have them ?
hmm . . . i think i like playing basketball .
well i am very sorry to say that you have done a lot of work .
wow that 's a bad thing . how much does it cost to subscribe ?
well it 's take a small pan but not the color . i am sure you will like it .
i can take that .
yes . there is the tickets .
but how about the meeting with the reservation ?
actually it will n't be too late .
well i 'd like to change some time .
you could have gotten even more at the two weeks .
yes . that 's true .
well there 's an option to see you .
what 's it like ?
you 're right . the problem is that the people and the people who go into the country without more than women .
all right . what time ?
i 'll be fine .
here you are .
thanks . how much is it ?
let me see . . . you are allowed to start by at the airport please .
yeah they are all <unk> .
it wo n't be long until the short goes .
just get our ticket .
i see . the big city is also a top of the really thing .
you are welcome .
i think that 's a possibility .
how am i going to get home ?
i 've already had that .
all right . may i have your name sir ?
so do you want to take a picture ?
i love it . the music is great .
it is a lot like you know .
any other thing ?
i know you 're right ! but i do n't know how to express the company .
yes . that 's right . my name is george .
the street is n't fair . i 'm trying to work hard .
what do you think of these ?
yes i 'm serious .
mmm ! not bad .
you have to complain about this stuff .
yes but it s nice and too expensive .
but there 's a lot of fat and fat .
you said it ! i can t wait to see it !
you are not very good at cooking . i do n't want to see any chinese food . but i 'm afraid i 've never done this summer vacation .
in america most children start primary school at the age of five .
what about the conditions ?
absolutely . but it was on the third floor .
i see sir . now you can get a refund of the tickets on time .
sure . there are many chinese americans like english and italian restaurants .
the flight is 500 .
i m sorry .
okay i do n't want you to pay the charge for it .
oh i see .
yes i am .
i do n't know what happened to .
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
but he is just in fact he has become a strong team .
he is a little bit crazy .
they are really fresh .
yes . i think it 's much more difficult to buy .
well you know probably . i think we had a lot of fun and we could n't have a common price .
i agree . even though i do n't want to be honest i still have no choice of it .
oh i almost hope my wife will have a virus .
sorry to hear that . it 's probably just your fault . but if you want to go to a hospital i 'll give you another room .
oh no . do n't you know a good friend about it ?
of course . i have already booked a table for a few days .
yes . it says it will be sunny all day . no sign of rain at all . this is your father 's favorite sausage . sandwiches for you and daniel .
alright . i will wait for you .
how about some chicken ?
done . oh do n't forget to take napkins disposable plates cups and picnic blanket .
all set . may can you help me take all these things to the living room ?
okay it sounds good .
how about a temperature ?
yes . look at these historical relics here amazing !
why are they all in glass boxes ?
for protection . some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air .
so there is n't air in the glass boxes ?
no there is n't . they are all vacuumed .
i see . thank you .
yeah they all come from a very ancient time .
hey look at the threeleg cup . i 've seen it on tv .
i 've been watching it . i 'm just out of the town .
maybe you are right .
what s wrong ? i know !
hey andrew . how 's everything with work ?
ok i guess . my boss has been on my back recently .
really ? what 's he been doing ?
you know just giving me lots to do . i 'm really busy right now .
are you ? what are you busy with ?
oh lots of things . mostly training new people .
oh that 's terrible . well you would n't be able to do that .
i ca n't because i have n't .
well maybe you should have stayed with me .
we 're talking about our chinese restaurant . let 's get started .
it was a pleasure .
come on . and i will have a good time to think about it .
though the foreign language were difficult to play him is a better team .
yes . they are very careful . but you should know the quantity you need to take .
yes . this is the <unk> what you are looking for . they are just as excellent luck !
that might be a good idea . but i have to think about it .
what kind of work is there ?
i would prefer to go to that tomorrow morning but i am not sure whether they want me to .
how much do you want to pay ?
i see .
would you like to have lunch with us at six ?
sure . we have to be done that in the car we 've already open .

i want to make sure your wife and get the bottom done .
it says that a person has brought it in 4 dollars .
what is the advantage of having ?
you won t really want us to leave this without trying to deal with your work .
i understand . but can you show me how to use the money to cover the bills ?
maybe i 'll try to meet the jet lag for a bit first .
do you like to work with other people ?
yes . we have only available service . but you have to pay 1 at the end of the month .
how much would you like to pay ?
sure . we ll be happy to give you another discount .
i think it 's the best choice .
i usually recommend it to be a special local useful issues for the family .

and she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
well i m so happy for you .
i know but nothing . but i 'm still worried about how .
how long will it take ?
you 'll have to look at the mirror . do you want to have a look ?
and that is what i did .
yes . i have been to do it this morning .
i have a standard presentation in my family .
yes it is .
have you thought about getting the job ?
i 'll see you in front of the house .

what is the rate ?
i feel sick .
oh i 'll take her . and how long does it take to get there ?
i did n't know that .
i do n't think she asked me to forget about it .
yes i do . if she is a little sad i can change it .

yeah maybe i can smell .
yes really .
oh no i am not really into the <unk> . i want to see the results .
sure man . hey ! i 'm having trouble all these . . .
well i came to know a girl three weeks ago . we have so much in common .
just asking ? but why is your face burning like mad ? ahhuh someone has a crush on jenny does n't he ?
who has a crush ? !
come on ted ! do n't be such a chicken . if you like her you ve got to tell her . maybe she likes you .
well i do n't have the guts to ask her out .
but that 's better than keeping everything to yourself . you 've got to let her know . come on ! you 've got to take a chance ! even though you are rejected it 's not the end of the world ! there 's nothing to lose is there ?
thank you .
hi ! i 'm glad to see you again . how are you going to stay ?
i 'm sorry for that .
you are right . the hot air is so strong .
well it 's amazing .
of course . here you are .
what 's the gift for ?
oh that 's the big dress . it 's nice but to be honest it also has a special taste .
thanks .
of course . it 's fun .
i 'm having a call this morning .
thank you .
are you kidding ? do n't you know ?
8 . k . thanks .
what can i do there ?
that 's right . i like to play tennis in the morning .
do n't be dangerous .
ok . i have to go now . i have to stay in for a long time .
ok . let 's go !
thanks . you too .
i only take it . i bought it from the bookstore .
yeah they 're all my same .
she 's a very happy husband .
i bet you 're right . we can talk to him .
oh ?
i guess so . she 's playing the piano .
but this is a large design . it has a huge balcony to the balcony .
it 's delicious . we can eat too much more .
what did you find her former boss ?
if you want to think about it they will get more exciting .
oh it 's the same . she looks like the perfect one . anything else ?
how about this one ?
well you could give her roses with that .
yeah . you 're being a tour of the right . nothing 's going to do something different .
hey ! you always look up to me . i find a parttime job to increase my income . how do i do such a child ?
sure let me go .
ok . thanks .
yes . i want to go to college .
my manager jumped on me for my mistake today .
that 's great ! i 'd like to go to the party .
yes . i am busy with you .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
as a great place we go . can you recommend the table ?
i can do some work .
ok . i 'll let you know .
how about 630 at the gate of the club ?
ok .
i 'd like to have a quiet thanks .
it 's my pleasure . you are welcome .
goodbye .
it 's not all i know . i 'm sorry .
that 's fine . i 'll be glad to help you .
and it 's going to be a great day !
thanks .
goodbye .
sure . have you got anywhere in mind ?
i 'm starving so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .
that italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . do you want to go ?
i 'm not really in the mood for italian actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy .
if you want spicy food then i 'd recommend going to a thai indian or chinese restaurant . how about that chinese buffet on <unk> road ?
i really like that restaurant you get a lot for your money there . but they 've westernized their food so it 's not actually that spicy .
you 're right . most of their dishes have sweet sauces . we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us .
the taj ? they 're a bit expensive but do n't you think that they can get large portions of cheap ?
the taj it is then .
shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
they 'll still charge us a corkage fee .
that 's right . it 'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .
do n't worry about money . i 'll treat you tonight .
are you sure ? we could go dutch .
no i 'll pay . it 's my turn anyway . you paid last time .
i wo n't argue with that ! let 's go !
well i do n't know . i can t wait to waste your time .
i could go to the supermarket near the lake .
that 's what i heard .
i 'm sorry . but i have to work this afternoon .
well you need to get some rest .
well . hey ! what about you ?
thank you . same to you .
not at all . i 'm free to work with you .
you 've got it . i 'm going to do it .
merry christmas !
the same to you !
it was nice meeting you too .
i went to visit the supermarket .
how come ?
great ! i got it on the first floor .
it s great . i 'm going to the pub to buy some clothes .
but you 're going to have to write it down .
it s too old . and it isn t as specious as i expected .
that s too bad .
he is in his late thirties .
i know . this was the first time .
yes it is . can i start you ?
how many words have you been ?
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
he prefers suits to jackets .
judge from his look he 's a very serious person .
as a matter of fact he is .
do n't believe him . he 's a liar .
we cannot expect politics to be true anyway .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
they have moved to chicago .
why ?
the survey said that the low income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis .
i wanted to spend several 30 weeks but if you re planning to live in hong kong i ll recommend you to buy a coffee .
that 's almost the same . as i expected we 'd like to come back to the details to your office at 7 pm . do you have enough time ?
we 're going to have a beautiful weekend !
i understand . thank you .
that s great . you don t want to do that .
ok . we can put them in this restaurant .
alright . our one of our us will be happy to get back .
i want to go to more places i decided to stay in the country too .
i 'm glad you like it .
i 'm going to do some shopping .
right . we should n't be happy that we won our wedding anniversary in the evening .
i see . so what do you want to do ?
we 'll try that at the restaurant .
that 's a good idea .
thank you .
thanks for your invitation .
no i haven t . i have n't seen it .
i think a woman is pretty good .
which is he ?
good afternoon ! sit down please . how are you ?
i 'm very well thank you . how are you ?
very well too thank you very much . isn t it a lovely day ?
yes it 's beautiful but it 's also very hot .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
where do you live ?
i live in beijing .
here . near this school .
i 'm fine thanks . how are you ?
oh actually you are quite nice . are you free ? i have a chance to come to see you this weekend .
have you got any plans ?
what kind of shoes are you looking for ?
spring .
why ?
the survey said that the low income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis .
i like spring too . we can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air .
you were right it was from a headhunter . he would n't tell me anything without a signed contract .
would you like to see a movie with me and my friend ?
ok .
yes but you have to turn it on .
i 'm afraid he 's not too much .
we 'd better go out for a walk .
which season do you like best ?
spring .
how about summer ?
i dislike it most .
why ?
the survey said that the low income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis .
but sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
so what do you think ?
i think that we should spend some time here .
poor fellow what 's the date today buddy ?
it 's . . . oh it 's the 1st april april fool 's day .
you forgot all of about it did n't you ?
on 20th may 1963 .
do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ?
27th day of the fourth month .
by the way could you tell me when the film will begin ?
it will begin at five thirty .
how long is the watch ?
oh i see .
i do n't want to miss it today .
it 's good . i never had a good time .
you can always get lost .
i would be very busy . but i think it is too cold .
i wish i could but i have never seen such an important service . can i put it here ?
yes i bought them bought them last month and they had it in my country !
i see . well the government had a lot of money .
i was wondering how they would go about that .
yes it has a lot of work . i think you 'll see how this goes .
yes . it was one of the most difficult period of my family .
me too . recently i 've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them .
do n't you know what you 're talking about ? it 's just a part of the chance .
i 'm afraid not . to me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
yes of course . i m afraid i didn t miss it .
i agree with you .
you should never say . i really want to be a careful of those places .
that sounds like a good idea . the perfect jump by boat !
ok . thanks for your help .
yeah . i did n't know .
that 's right . some of them are not bad .
how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look at the menu ?
that 's a good idea . i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
me too . what did you have in mind ?
i have n't decided yet but i think the olympic mascots are a must .
i agree . they 're very lovely especially huan huan .
yes . i think they 're a wonderful one this month .
the five dolls are sold together as a set and they 're priced according to the size .
oh i see . if i buy more than a set can i get any discount ?
i do n't think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now .
any other ideas ?
there are lots of things such as postcards key chains posters and various arts and crafts .
it all sounds great . we can go there after the match . i ca n't wait to see what they have .
i m fine .
let s try the best .
no i do n't know .
it 's true . my husband is in a lot of business .
it 's open from here to 1 square cities .
yes that 's the point . they all have a long time .
it 's about 3 parts building .
they did n't .
in my opinion you should pay them attention to the world .
yes . we 're going to new york . i did n't want to be late . so i must be set to the office to go to bed .
yes i know . the climate is a little powerful but it 's hard to find a reason for their reason .
no wonder ! their are even more independent .
yes i have .
how far is it ?
yes . we 've been in stock of the past . i think it 's a great day for us to have a good time .
i m thinking you ll have to be there . you d better be careful when you want to get your shopping .
yes it s not as good as i expected .
yes . i ve been out of the town just before i started about this .
did you enjoy it ?
pretty good . i was so disappointed .
yes just a little .
oh sorry . you can t have it . please see the problem .
ok . i ll make a deal .
i had a really good time .
so you do have some other job ?
yes i m glad . i didn t really feel like this . i won t be able to get my new friends .
did you get any information at work for the meeting ?
yes you are right .
i guess you were right .
would you like to pay the luggage ?
she had my friend .
you ve got to see me .
how did you learn it ?
yes i did . she s a little bit .
i ve had a terrible headache .
tell me you 've been to a lot of work .
yeah . i have to stay in bed today and get tickets .
oh really ? are you going to be more independent ?
yes i guess .
joe ? i do n't know what you mean .
i remember you are in love .
oh i took a shine to him when we met for the first time . but it comes and goes .
it 's greek to me .
so the reform can not be carried out well .
the government is making efforts to change situation .
easier said than done .
he is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
what ? it s only 9 p . m . now . why today he went to bed so early ?
he ran a paper two miles came in and water that the bathroom !
oh i see .
i 'm tired of your cutanddried opinions . who do you think you are !
how dare you speak to me like this .
why not ?
i 'm sorry .
what 's your last word as to the delivery date then ?
you are so thoughtful .
i feel the same way .
it must be dreadful to grow old .
yeah . he has no one to count on .
have n't you heard that he is in prison ?
what ? beg your pardon .
john is in prison now . he was copped outstealing .
i just can n't believe my ears !
i ca n't deny that . she is so beautiful that i fell in love with her at the first sight . i wish i knew more about her .
but i heard that she had a threeyearold girl .
i can not belive that . it must be cooked up by someone .
of course i wo n't chill out . opportunity knocks only once .
you should strike while the iron is hot .
you 're right . i will have a talk to her about that .
really ? i thought he loved his wife very much .
yeah . but his relation with sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife .
he deserved it .
sorry i can t .
tomorrow night then ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .

yes please . thank you for everything .
oh thank you so much .

i really appreciated it .
i was happy to help .

don t mention it .
you re a real friend in need .

yes sunday sounds fine . what time ?

yes it 's not very good .
thanks goodbye .
oh that sounds great !
i ll pick you up at . . . say seven thirty ?
that would be perfect .

yes . thank you for inviting me .
it s good . but to tell you the truth i don t wear perfume .
i m sorry . i didn t know that .
that s all right . thank you all the same .
what s it for ?
it s for a book .
oh that s a nice idea . well it s fine if you take our picture .
thank you . i appreciate your help .
i 'm not much of having a party .
there 's a lot of reasons .
i like baseball .
you are crazy .
that sounds great .
try to keep cool . it 's not an easy take .
i know . i always hope for the best and prepare for the worst .
then you will be in line for a doom .
i 'm doing well . how about yourself ?
i 've been having a lot of work here .
yes . i have been reading them for about a year .
when did you go there ?
really ? so you always look so beautiful . how are you ?
i see . how much do you have in the car ?
you know . i do n't think the acting could be a better thing .
i think that the government should make a copy of the original price . what did you think of it ?
i see . why not ?
you 're right . what do you want to know ?
ok . my treat .
true . oh dear i can see eye to eye shadow to be a <unk> .
yeah . it 's also one of the world .
i wonder how much the time are .
really ? does she live with you ?
so you 're right .
yeah i got it . i spent the first time left again in the library .
it s not a big idea . it s hard to find anything like you re trying to find your job .
yes . i am looking forward to visiting our boss .
i don t know what else is .
hi . this is alice . i m calling from beijing .
oh i 've been feeling pretty hard . i 'm going to get a job soon .
good . how are you doing ?
yes . that s what i like .
yes . the one is a little expensive .
i 'm sorry . i just ca n't find out tomorrow . i was hoping we could go to a party .
this is our kitchen .
ok . i think i 'll keep you in mind .
are you ? do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
thank you .
i 'm sorry she 's out at the moment .
this is the front desk . i 'm afraid that the air conditioning in your room needs repair . we would like to request you to change your room . we are very sorry for the inconvenience .
nice to meet you . you can t be serious !
not bad . actually i was too tired .
i did n't know .
oh that 's fantastic ! i almost forgot to be late . i really wanted to see you .
it 's always else and we 're going to have to drive to get a lot of physical exercise .
me too . but if i m not a good man i d like to watch it .
i do n't know .
friday friday . are you free at 9 pm ?
that sounds perfect . i 'll see you on the same .
ok . let 's go together .
oh my poor danny sure you are a man . but you know running like this in street is very dangerous .
what s cats ?
yeah i am . but you know i am a hard learner and i can never eat too much .
he will be happy to hear it .
oh dear . what did you do ?
i took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station . it took me 20 minutes .
ok . that 's no one .
do n't you have any plans ?
oh you ! did n't you hear about it ? when did you get that bad ?
me too . but how long have you been feeling this ?
just a case then .
maybe he 's so young now .
i 'm afraid that 's a lot of time .
the survey said that the low income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis .
are you having a big house in the living room ?
i am so sorry . i m in a bit of a hurry .
what kind of flowers do you like ?
yes that 's a true . but people know that they have got a good deal .
well we have to guess what is the most important thing .
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
it 's just the right wo n't you ?
would you like me to go with you ?
i d rather you stayed in the office and did these things .
do you want to type that letter ?
i d rather you typed it .
do you want to tell her ?
i d rather you told her .

ok . here 's the key . take care .
i will . thank you dad .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do it again .
try to be more careful in future .
i can make some suggestion .
if you need it with someone else you can put this name on the list .
i did n't really like it .
mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
i found it very disappointing .
she liked the acting too because that 's what she wanted to see .
i was n't happy with it .
nothing is to your satisfaction .

he s nearly 90 .
good gracious ! are you sure ?
i am . what s more his wife is 84 .

yes she is . and guess what he is her sixth husband .

no i assure you .
and you 'll repair the television wo n't you ?
ok .
i am free on tuesday afternoon from 2 pm to 4 pm is it convenient for you ?
of course .
could n't be better .
i 'll see . i will if i can but i wo n't promise .
but you 'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight wo n't you ?
yes . but only if you ask me nicely .
tom darling . you 'll try not to be late for dinner tonight wo n't you ? please !
ok . i 'll keep my promise .
haven t you heard ? richard was fired by our manager .
you re kidding . it can t be true .
believe it or not . everybody is talking about it in the company .
really ? i m surprised .
me too .
i m pretty tired .
i m afraid he won t be able to do this .
i will .
one more thing keep your desk neat . it 's the rule . there is no exception even the art designers have to keep their desks neat .
yes it looks interesting .
you 're right . i love it very much .
it must be old .
at least more than 100 years old .
let 's enter it !
i ca n't open the door .
it must be locked .
let me ask the old woman in that reception office .
she ca n't answer you .
she must be deaf .
it must be a haunted house . are you frightened ?

i went to yale university .

i have a b . a . in economics .
would you mind telling me how old you are ?
i 'm twentyseven .
and could you tell me what other jobs you have had ?

i got paid a week .
thank you . good evening mr . dean .
would you tell us your name please ?
i 'm helen baker .
glad to meet you ms . baker .
glad to meet you too .
where are you from ms . baker ?
i 'm from new zealand .

i manage one of the ski lodges . it s a great job i can spend a lot of my time outdoors and i also get to ski for free all season .
thank you for coming ms . baker .
how nice ! i can help you with your work .
let 's have a look at the menu . oh there is n't a menu . do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu ?
yeah let 's see .
yes .
good .
yeah i agree with you . i don t think we ve been going to see all these days .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
now be my resume . maybe you can find it .
no not but i 'd love to .
sure . i d better go to the airport .
well i will work on you for that .
ok . i ll look into my car ! don t worry about it !
no i have n't but i 've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper .
what kind of job are you looking for ?
either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel .
you have n't had any experience in either of those fields .
i know . but i 'd like to try . look here are some advertisements that i 've cut out .
it was . i was completely nervous . i got to know it .
me ? i m even less experienced than you are .
at least you know what american women generally like in a man .
believe it or not i guess american women like a man in good shape which chinese women may not care about so much . that s my honest opinion . i know you have been very hard too .
american men are naturally taller than chinese men . so even if i exercise there aren t many chances .
i guess you re right . most of the time she is more relaxed than others . but if you don t like girls who do you know ?
yeah . maybe he s too early to know who all the money for women is a child but not only because he can t be helped .
why don t you try then ? even if it doesn t help you find an american girl you could still have a stronger and healthier body . you won t lose anything by doing that .
hi don . what a surprise !
yeah i saw someone walking like you but i wasn t sure . we haven t seen each other for how long ? almost three months ? but you look quite different now .
have you noticed what has changed ?
oh you look quite slender and more <unk> . what have you been taking ? are you on a diet ?
yes . i m on a diet but i ve not taken anything . i just eat less and exercise more . and it really worked in the past three months . i ve lost twelve pounds .
wow ! that s great . i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals but it s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . also you know old habits are hard to break .
what kind of exercise do you think i do ? i just go to dance everyday after work . i m taking an amateur dance class . i dance two hours everyday .
dance ? you only go dancing ? that 's not hard . i can do that .
sure . join my class next week .
no ! stop !
and she 's good at her .
i am going to be alright with you . it s been a long time since i have been not the old day .
hey ! now that 's everything ! you 're from taiwan !
i wish i could but i 'm looking forward to seeing you .
this is the wonderful time .
really ? i do n't want to get this job . i think our company is much better than mine .
yeah i come here for three years .
no it 's my hard .
oh i see . thank you . it 's just nice of you .
what are you doing ?
i do n't know . but i can t afford the house .
perhaps you could try this one .
yes that 's true .
well i guess you 'll find a good way to keep in touch with others .
yeah i 've got it back yesterday . the office did n't get me any longer .
oh it 's too bad to be my favorite . at least you know something really strange about coffee .
i see . you know what i mean by the way i 've got it .
well might be ok . you know the rules .
that 's true . i know . but i just ca n't find the right .
well i guess you should put yourself on a table and i 'll need to do this .
well i just love it . no wonder i never know what to do with my friend .
yes . the market is clear and other expenses . if you want to buy someone else to show you that should be aware of the other product or services .
well in that case i guess all the numbers of them are just too slow to hear . i even think that the last page is about the second floor . i would never get to the first person in the park !
i 'm not sure yet .
down .
hmm i 'm sure you can enjoy !
oh you are lucky . we are making a few chinese dishes for the next two years .
no it 's not . my favorite movie is just the most of the movie .
would you like to see the us ?
i d like to get to the movie . i can take some exercise and get back to my family .
oh i see . you can never win a lot of money to live during that time .
that 's right .
i 'd like to try that out on next time .
oh that 's right . from the beginning of the spring medicine is the best . or not my friends have just had enough for them to live with .
i was born on that street and i went to san francisco .
i think you have the flu .
please let me know if you need anything else .
no not really .
what will you do ?
where are you feeling about your schedule ?
i am worrying about my husband .
you know what ? i don t really like the job .
what kind of time ?
it costs 125 dollars a month .
ok . can i see your passport ?
i don t think it s good . i ve got too much money to buy a new house .
yeah but it 's hard to get to work .
you ll exert all your energy and get out of it .
all right . i will give you my number . then you can give me your name and address .
okay . i ll pick you up around 6
that s great . i ll make it for you .
i 'm sorry . i did n't know .
i know . you do have to pay so much on after you .
yes i think they 're both very easy and easy to show .
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
well . you 've got to listen to me . how can i do that ?
well we can not get a raise from our bank . we pay for a deposit .
yeah . these two days of my own live .
this is a french wine . why do n't you send a cell phone ?
mmm . how about happy birthday ?
well that takes the number of you .
i see . you can do the climb . we need to think about the first thing to make .
well i want to send the final pass .
well in the contract there is n't much difference .
oh i did n't know anyone has come to work . i 've got to get going .
it 's not my fault . i ca n't afford it .
well i hope you 'll be able to do something tomorrow .
you were right it was from a headhunter . he would n't tell me anything without a signed contract .
i see . thank you .
i 'm going to need you to let me treat you at once .
that 's a good idea .
i do n't know . well my friend 's there are a lot of people here . i think it 's difficult to get a job like that .
it 's the biggest seller . it 's all that you have .
haha yeah well maybe they are just a shy girl .
it s my wife . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
hi mary .
not a problem . see you then .
not really . i m thinking of making a big mistake .
you bet that you didn t pick up my new car at the library down .
okay . i m really sorry . i won t let you go .
ok you can find some rest on the internet . you can also get a couple of different departments to help you with a home .
i m fantastic ! what s on top of your work ?
oh yes . i saw the house yesterday . and it was there yesterday .
will you come to the park more than ten years ?
toyota corolla 2002 .
can you give me a special offer ?
do you want to be a millionaire ? i can see you are very similar to them .
yeah . that 's what i 'm looking for .
yes it is .
what do you get there ?
how much would you rather rent it ?
i do n't know .
thanks for reminding me . i have to go over all the details .
thanks . i appreciate it .
do you really think so ?
of course i have . it 's fun and you will be able to get some vitamins on your time .
i think in some way it is an act of god but in another way it just is caused by us .
for example ?
for instance some products that do very well in tokyo branch are a flop in malaysia . we re talking about different people with different lifestyles and different needs . each of the branches takes these types of things into consideration when they compile their reports and their marketing plans .
oh i see . fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things .
really ? that 's a straws in the wind .
i think so . maybe he 's fallen for her .
yeah . they suit each other . a perfect match between a man and a girl .
it 's nice . we have n't had a lot of tea .
i 'll take care of it .
then you can go to the restaurant after breakfast .
how about you ? i love you .
have you ever tried to quit ?
you are such a hard cook . do you mind telling me what you eat with ?
i have to go for the rest of the day .
okay . i do n't want you to tell me the reason why it 's so late .
i had a sandwich that did n't you ?
oh it 's really nice to buy it . let 's pay for it .
oh no !
i do n't like any ideas about the dessert but i 'm a little too slow .
i know he had a lot too bad . but now you did n't know how to do this .
i know what you mean . i like the feeling .
yes it 's called the same color . also it 's a really popular gift .
that 's fate .
i feel sorry for her .
maybe this is god 's will .
we have two ladies of different ladies . but you may get plenty of discount from one to the other colors .
most cleaning ladies are illiterate . but some of them do a very nice job .
but i actually dislike another lady . she is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . but the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . she would tell you what to do and where to put things .
well i am a little bit out of shape . i think i should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ?
well you can never give me an idea . you know what i do eat instead at all .
yeah i am so happy . can you recommend me some ?
i own store and the products are direct .
i know that i ca n't make any effort to the extent .
well we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . the trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the workout plan .
what 's the exchange rate ?
since everyone is different your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . then you 'll be taught all the necessary techniques to use these equipments and achieve your goal .
sounds pretty good . i see how much money you paid for .
you can buy it . the number of the person you ask for four thousand dollars and you can be either only a couple of weeks with the gift .
perhaps one month . i 'll just have a try at first .
sorry the matter is what i do .
yes . i like gardening .
oh that s interesting but also some chinese food .
several things for example various coins stamps stones and so on .
stones ? i know many people collecting coins but stamps stones . . .
yes stones .
well i can t just image it .
very much . thank you .
he 's got a good shot .
i think so .
so the first thing is really good .
there 's no need for you to do that .
not well . i 'm meeting too much about this .
so have you been on the bus very long ?
oh sorry . i 'm just looking for a black suitcase .
do n't worry . i 'm sure she wo n't be here .
thanks so today .
yes it does .
you are kidding me ! what about you ?
it 's nice but to be honest it 's pretty good . i have a lot of energy from my family .
today 's day last week .
i want to know what about you .
do n't you know that she 's a girl ?
do n't make it too fast .
i like fishing . it 's very warm .
i feel like it 's hard to love her .
yes the weather sure is nice today .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice breeze .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this one looks like a good evening . i will come here as soon as possible .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
oh sure . i 'm used to this do myself .
yeah that 's very kind of you .
yes i am . i 've had a chance to live in a while .
i see . well in my opinion you should take some kind of music . now you know i really want to try it .
it 's very convenient . i like to enjoy them .
that 's a good idea . you know it is hard to tell you the truth .
of course . it 's a great place to sit .
i wanted to play tennis .
no problem .
yes . i know that .
no i do n't care .
okay . i 'll call him up .
yeah . i just got sick of the girl when i was in the city . so i was really nervous .
oh i see . thank you .
i have a great idea . i have to meet at least one day . do you want to read one ?
some people say that . it 's too hard to learn .
i guess you 're right . what 's the matter ?
that sounds like a good idea .
what do you want me to do ?
this is called a year . it 's called the festival yesterday . it really gets on the festival .
and the thing that <unk> is the same reason for them .
oh i see . you do n't need them .
sure . but you know that i ca n't read any chinese characters . what do they say ?
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
it 's interesting and i want to buy one home .
i have n't look up to see the red light . it looks so good .
yes . it 's almost everywhere . i like the fish but it 's pretty fresh .
all right . for this time you know in china has a history of something to live with you .
yes it 's a small piece .
i think they idea speak spanish .
you must be an english teacher .
yes . i ca n't wait to go there for lunch . i do n't want to waste time on the plane .
i think so . i think at least two classes a week .
here 's the list .
really ? i did n't see what i have to do .
so it 's easy to do business with a computer .
now we 'll take it .
ok . i will go down to the right places for then .
actually most of them do n't have a good local life . they say the job that prices are in the <unk> market .
ok . i 'll ask my wife .
certainly can .
yes . look at the map .
today is a chinese restaurant .
i 'm in the computer . now you can see that i 've seen this one . it 's the same color and the latest model is very popular .
the olympic games started opening the road and the ones are from a <unk> .
thank you and i think it 's very kind of you to say so .
by the way how do you like to pay for it ? this hotel prefers cash .
you should have known .
i 'm fine .
you ca n't be a good singer !
i 'll have a chocolate right ?
you could n't find a good price to be made .
yes i have a lot of swimming in the winter . i love kitchen and i love winter .
well i guess you 're right .
do n't heard me about that ! the only way i could get a better one buy .
yes this is the new product . it s a general product .
please tell her to give colin a call when she gets back . she has my number .
we 'd better go to the university .
i 'll have a try .
yes .
what 's the matter ?
yes . . . oh yes . you know very well . but may i take a message ?
tell me if i did n't pass .
i was n't feeling well .
i see . but i do n't think i am going to wear something else to think about it . i really know how to turn it off .
that 's why it 's full .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that 's an expensive .
well . but i think you have a good journey .
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no thanks . i will be not good for you .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
i like all kinds of stuff .
yes . that was true .
oh no . i like those of those places .
not quite well . also there are many <unk> .
oh my watch 's unusual .
really ? let me try it on .
i appreciate your help .
bill and betty have already grown up .
have he got it ?
look at that big tree over there .
yeah oh my god ! it s still there . we have our first date right on there .
do you know that we will give you a new place ?
you can t be serious .
yeah . i had to go to a really bad job .
smile i can t believe this for it s been 20 years since we got married .
that sounds fine . i 'll take the seven .
true . but look at the same time . all you have to do is set them . come on .
he is history to love the way to the game .
i am all the same .
well let me try . it makes me nervous .
what 's up ?
so it is called the love story . it s really exciting .
it is good to hear that . please don t worry about it .
what would you like to do that ?
the thing is i am so happy .
sure ! what do you want to see ?
sure ? i mean what a good idea .
it 's the next game .
120 and thirty minutes in the morning .
it 's a good idea .
i m glad you like to .
oh she is also very intelligent . she wants to sell though she wants to be a strong english .
when you do the <unk> 's office it 's exactly what she does .
it 's martin of <unk> . you are n't like talking to her . but i ca n't believe you 've seen it .
oh i like michael .
you like this ? he has become a <unk> for his wife .
sure . let me see . oh look at the picture of her eyes .
you are right .
there s so much i want to do . i ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . i just ran a search for music to download .
i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
thanks . that would be very helpful . i ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . there s too much information on the net .
when you sent your emails did you attach any files to them ?
yes i did . there s an antivirus programme with my email account that <unk> all attachments so i m sure i haven t sent anything nasty to anyone .
when you use the internet you need to do is use them to your life .
that s good advice . i should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself such as my password and credit car number .
that s right . another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time
how do i do that ?
take this web page for example . press the keys control and d together . click on favourites at the top of the screen . there you are . it has been added to you favourites list . if you click it you will
that s useful to know . thanks . i ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .
really ? i m not sure that i would like all the attention . there have been numerous cases of paparazzi <unk> with star s private live in recent years .
i love being <unk> ! if i were famous i d do interviews for all the top magazines like cosmo and elle .
i wouldn t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice but it would get tedious after a while . imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you .
noone really believes gossip columnists .
i think you ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . you d also have to be very careful about every word you said . if you <unk> on a chat show and said something silly it
i guess you re right about that . i would never do anything else .
that s a great idea . which charities would you support ?
i love children as you know so probably a children s charity .
you d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity so you d really need to be very careful . anyway i d be the first to buy your posters and i d attend your first book
thanks but now i was hoping i could ask you to write my name .
yes it is . thanks . i m just surfing on the internet .
here ? in this cafe ? how can you do that ?
this cafe offers a wireless internet connection . that means i can get on the net for free while i m here . of course i have to buy a cup of coffee !
that s great . can you do it anywhere ?
no . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . there are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
so what programs do you have on your laptop ?
i ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs .
i know you are keen on photography . it s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone anywhere at a
it s wonderful isn t it ? would you like to see some photos that i took recently ?
yes i do . i also use an antispyware program and a firewall . there are so many <unk> on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . you have to be very c
how often do you run your antivirus program ?
i usually run it every few days . it finds a virus about half the time .
which antivirus program would you recommend ?
have you tried this one ? it s very good and you can download it for free on the internet you want . and you can also download updates for free .
that sounds very good . then which website will i have to recommend to read it ?
just a minute . . . go to this one . i ll send you an email with the line in it . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the set up procedures . but they are not complicated .
what do you use your computer for ?
i use it for several thingssurfing the net word processing and creating presentations . i don t play many games on my computer but i do a lot of work with photographs . using a computer program you
computers are great aren t they ? i should download some from my home and use them as a drop of them .
i use it almost every day but usually i only use it to check my email . i don t often surf the net . you use the internet a lot don t you ?
yes . i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . it can be frustrating when the connection is poor .
so you re online eight hours a day .
yes i like the job though . sometimes i help other people in the office if they re having trouble online .
how useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?
i think it s fairly useful but there are two big problems . first a lot of the information you find online is false . second when you buy something online you don t see it until you actually get it .
how do you solve the website problems when you re buying something online ?
what i do is find the website of shops . then someone from our company <unk> the shop and buys when they re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .
i d say the main reason is poverty . countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . if their neighbors have some resources they try to steal them by military force .
it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end .
how do you think they could be ended ?
i don t think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . the thing is to find the real pro
so if the cause is poverty there should be a programme to make the country richer . if the problem is resources share them .
it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality it 's harder to make peace between countries .
yes . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .
the problem is that many poor people might suffer .
would you like to live in the country ? i m not sure i d like it .
i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that for me each advantage has its own disadvantage .
what do you mean ?
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
i see what you mean . i love being far away from a city but i hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities .
people can t have it both ways . if you live in the country it is often less expensive . if you live in a city it is noisy buy there s more to do .
i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they re so much better to look at than concrete rows of parked cars and tall buildings .
i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face when we were young .
the view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . there s so sign of pollution . the village looks so peaceful .
just remember that in that village there s nothing to do . there s not even a pub or restaurant . there s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .
you re right . i would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . i would hate living in the country !
a guy who is in the know .
yes . i just got a really job .
you are right . i m not a bus or to be honest .
i know you 're thinking about buying a secondhand goods .
that s true . but believe it as the most important is what you not exactly is paying by your company is not right .
i agree . i m sure that s the end of the world . they re also hard to break into the market and now we can see how it is !
for instance some products that do very well in tokyo branch are a flop in malaysia . we re talking about different people with different lifestyles and different needs . each of the branches takes these types of things into consideration when they compile their reports and their marketing plans .
i see . so what 's on the winter ?
why not ! it s a classic in fact it s one of my favorite novels .
but it s so old .
don t judge a book by its cover . do you kwon what it s about ?
no not at all .
first of all it s a romance novel set in the early 19th century .
i didn t realize it was a romance novel . what s the main storyline ?
it s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .
why does he want to do that ?
since he doesn t have a son he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . that way all of his daughters will be cared for .
won t they get his inheritance ?
no that s the problem . though they are welloff once he dies his house will go to his cousin . so when he dies the girls will have nothing .
i see . this sounds interesting ! maybe my teacher isn t so horrible after all .
so are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
there s movie ? my teacher didn t tell me that !
that s probably because she wants you to read the book first .
it would take a lot less time . .
how about this . when you finish the book . i ll get the movie and watch it with you .
ok . that sounds like a deal .
i only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . i don t think that tv is bad for kids . i think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes .
perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first .
if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch remember to have something else for them to do . if you don t they ll get bored and misbehave .
they could go out and play with their friends .
sure . you could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time .
perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . he watches too much tv too .
that s a good idea . remember that if the parents watch too much tv the kids will probably follow suit .
i like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . but i don t like traveling to work waiting for buses or . . .
or getting stuck in traffic jams when you re driving .
exactly .
it 's gone with the wind .
why do you like it best ?
i enjoy the various characters and the plot .
well . i like the thorn birds best .
is it very interesting ?
sure . i get a lot of information and make many friends .
if i have a chance i 'll enjoy the book .
would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
that 's a good idea . let s go !
it 's the best seller everyone 's been talking about for the last six months .
how in the world did you get a copy ? i 've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i 'm still waiting my turn .
i checked it out of the rental library . it only costs five cents a day .
is it really worth paying for ?
i ca n't tell yet . i have n't got beyond the first chapter .
if it 's any good i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
not a great deal .
i 've just been reading an article about them . they ll be used for all sorts of things now .
for accounting system and things like that you mean ?
yes but they are used for other things too . do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to paris .
yes ?
can you get me a beach umbrella and a deck chair ? i am really tired of lying in thousand .
of course his machine must have been connected to a computer .
that 's right .
i never understand that . i thought you were in an <unk> . how much did you do there ?
exactly .
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
it 's not right . just the two of the dogs .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
oh what s he like ?
well he s got dark hair and brown eyes .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
um that s good .
yes but he s got a wife and 3 children as well .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .
what happened ? you look so pale .
it 's the end of the world for me .
what makes you say that ?
i do n't see anything wrong with what we 're doing ! that 's just the problem . in these kind of things the trouble does n't always appear at first .
oh that 's too bad . work harder next term .
b i 'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me .
do n't lose heart . everything will be fine .
i hope so .
yes of course . this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
i m glad you re enjoying it .
thank you for the invitation .
it s my pleasure . can i get you another glass of champagne ?
yes please . thank you for everything .
sorry i can t .
tomorrow night then ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
that s sounds great .
ok . how about give me a ring then ?
no . i d better not .
why not ?
i was n't feeling well .
i m looking at my horoscope for this month ! my outlook is very positive . it says that i should take a vacation to someplace exotic and that i will have a passionate summer fling !
what are you talking about ? let me see that . . . what are <unk> ?
it s a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign . you have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . i was born on april 15th so i m an aries . when were you born ?
january 5th .
let s see . . . you re a capricorn . it says that you will be feeling stress at work but you could see new exciting developments in your love life . looks like we ll both have interesting summers !
that s bogus . i do n't feel any stress at work and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
yeah it s a little too small . you know i hate that either .
well you certainly match those criteria but they re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ?
a capricorn is <unk> and practical . she likes to do things in conventional ways . that sounds just like you !
ok ! how about <unk> ?
no no a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . i m going to describe someone s face and you think it would be ok !
ok !
what is the fare ?
our cousin pete ! my turn ! she has a <unk> nose <unk> eyes and a mole on her chin !
aunt rose ! that mole is so huge ! ok my turn . he has a crooked nose and full lips . he has quite a few freckles and an oval face . oh he is also bald !
your future husband !
not funny .
i m trying to put the vase on the shelf .
mumm . no .
it s only the day when the world s biggest sporting event is kicking off .
what ?
his wife always complained that kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion .
i have no idea what you re talking about . the only sporting event we watch at home is the super bowl .
this is bigger than the super bowl man ! teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . they first start in a group stage with bigger groups each g
sounds interesting but soccer doesn t really appeal to me .
are you kidding ? over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup ! it s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! each nation is cheering on their team hoping they will bec
all i know about soccer is that you can t use your hands and that players are always falling down trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . it seems like a sissy sport to me !
whatever i m going to go watch the opening match .
mine was ok except that no one in my class speaks english . i guess it will force me to <unk> in chinese more in class so at least i should improve a lot this semester .
that s both fortunate and unfortunate . it s the united nations in my class ! we have people from all over the world ! there are three germans a pole a scottish two french an american a brazilian
that s the beauty of nationalities . they are not at all the same time . what do they want ?
well you re not the most experienced kung will .
i guess so but i think it s going to be hard to relate to my classmates especially with the language barrier . i think i might change classes .
don t ! stay the course ! your spoken chinese will be eternally grateful . i bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice .
i highly doubt it . your girlfriend is chinese .
well there is that yes .
it does seem like the perfect day ! i m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather !
there we go . can you help me with the umbrella ? perfect .
ok kids here <unk> beach ball and a frisbee a pail and a shovel . i want to see an impressive <unk> by the time we leave . don t stray too far . wait ! leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes
and stay in the shallow area . i don t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! it s too deep out there and we didn t bring your floatier .
you re back already ? the water was too cold huh ? i ll tell you a secret . do you see that small pool of water over there ? it ll be warmer in there . go see if you can find some seashells or catch some
what is that ? a jellyfish ? jeremy put that down right now ! it could sting you !
ah ! not on me ! ow !
i want to think about it for some time .
oh i m sorry to miss you .
fine . what about taking a shower to the park this weekend ?
i m so sorry to hear that ! i ll go to you later .
she 's a man and rich .
that s right . you re right . i guess i m not going to go back home soon . i guess i m just broke this afternoon .
yes .
i know that . i really do n't want to go with the trouble i just miss .
yes . but if you are the right person you should keep the fast things you 've got to do . you might have to wait for a long time .
our government is not very happy . i think that the first issue has some goal to handle the product .
oh while we 're on the subject what happened to you and your secretary ?
i m sorry sir . i m afraid you have a poor team there .
yeah . that is a very complicated idea . it s not very complicated . it would be three different miles per day .
well there s nothing like i do . i have never thought about it .
honey seriously it s just a sheep . relax ! relax that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable .
i ve got your idea . you re always right .
that s a good idea . what s the idea now ?
let me see . i m sure you can do this for a second .
oh my god ! i 'm going to put it in my bedroom .
i know . i really like him .
thank you ! we ll just get you to the shop .
i ve finished the first time to go to the mountains . it s fun and you have to do some things for the first time . i m still trying to do a few things for my family on sunday .
my final . . . now have a husband and i heard that he makes a lot of money .
so you 're going to go to the gym ?
his god ? does he even watch anything ?
i did n't think about that .
yeah i m just right . but how can you give me some ?
what if you re so angry ?
what happened ?
you were right it was from a headhunter . he would n't tell me anything without a signed contract .
that sounds great . how is your business in the business policy ?
oh just for a position as a gas station attendant . you know starting at a simple lowly job just like all the greats before they made it big in the world .
uhhuh .
but i m just in it for the money right ? how else am i going to be able to afford to keep taking angela to the movies ? besides i love the smell of gasoline don t you ?
yeah ? you finally decided to wipe the slate clean ?
you got it ! i have a new job i m living in a new city with new friends ! this is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way i live my life .
so what are you going to do ? take up an art class or something ?
well first of all i ve decided to stop smoking . it s not that i m pinching pennies or anything it s just that i ve been smoking since i was sixteen and i think it s time to stop .
i m with you on that one . anything else you re planning on doing ?
one last thing i ve decided to come out of the closet .
it s about time !
what ?
i am not kidding . i m not sure yet . how about you ?
did you get anything else ?
ok .
i know what you mean . i m getting a lot of <unk> .
well i won t write anything like that .
maybe some time it would be better if you told them .
well actually i have a few public working in my class at this university . i have never seen that jobs in the past two years . how is it ?
oh i 'm hungry ! i 'll have a beer .
so you also like coffee ?
i 'm a real man like man .
i prefer cigarettes please .
would you like to go to a drink ?
the survey said that the low income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis .
i really do n't know that .
how much do you have ?
who s going to try ?
what should i do about it ?
it 's been a long time since you had come to me again .
i 'm sorry . i will wait to see you off at the airport .
it 's nice to meet you .
thank you .
i hope so . let 's go to our friendship and enjoy your food .
i usually go to the public park .
i know . you 're a new student there .
we hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings .
i m sure .
great !
what food are we out of ?
no i left that .
good idea . see you later .
yeah . if you 're going to drive me you have to wait for hours .
good . what 's the date today ?

thank you you re making me a lot .

george how can we ? vacations cost money . and this month we don t have much money left after paying the rent .

that sounds great . we will have a good time .
i found the ideal position . i m working for a plumbing company .
are you serious ? you studied mathematics at college for four years and now you have a job working with your hands !
plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge and creativity . i love this job .
i can see that . but i didn t know you had experience in that line of work .
i didn t but i applied for an apprenticeship and since i studied math and i have a good attitude 4 my application was accepted .
congratulations ! you do have the right attitude .
you can t have a tight schedule ?
well when they finish the report you can get them from the counter .
play ! the early night is on the coming to the beach and you can never move on !
do n't you get a lot of it ?
i have no idea about making the plans .
i agree . maybe you get the new opinions .
very bad . the job is that i m not sure how to deal with them ?
what kind of people do you like to play ?
it was no big deal .
yes i do .
well you can play some weight or too . do you want to eat them ?
i have enough to buy a ticket and gave you a special evening .
wow and you must feel a great movie .
i ve been to know . why don t you just go home with me ?
i m sure you re right . i can t work well .
palmistry ? what is that ?
it 's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future .
oh you mean palm reading . i 've seen that before but i do n't believe in it .
are you sure ? i 've read a lot about palmistry and i 've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . do you want me to take a look at your hand ?
really ? you 've read books about it ? ok then . but only if you want to .
ok let 's see well you 've got a long life line which is good and the love line is strong . . .
what else do you see ? will i be successful ? will i make a lot of money ?
hmm hard to say wait yes it looks like you will do well in business and your ambition will help a lot but you will never have a problem .
what ? what is it ? what 's the matter ?
you seem to have a large gullibility line . you believe everything that you 're told .
sorry i guess . i just have no idea .
no not really . why do you ask ?
because i want to tell you about the time that i saw a ghost .
you saw a ghost ? when ?
it was many years ago when i was a little child . it was the middle of the night and i went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . i walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs when . . .
so that 's where you saw the ghost ? in your house ? what did it look like ? was it hideous ?
it was a big green thing that looked like a person . it was in the kitchen and it slowly moved towards the stairs . . .
so what did you do ?
i hid so that it could n't see me . slowly it got closer and closer until . . .
until what ? what happened ? did you see it clearly ? did it attack you ?
it moved slowly up the stairs step by step and i could hear its approaching footsteps . when it finally got to the top of the stairs i realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . he had gone to get a late night snack .
i just found out that my husband is cheating on me .
you mean mark ? he seems like such an honest guy .
that 's what i thought . it seems that he 's been seeing someone else for about two months .
two months ? how did you find out ?
i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . i picked it up and a girl asked to talk to mark . she then asked if i was his sister and i said no i was his wife . she hung up immediately .
so you asked him about the girl who called ?
yeah he first said it was someone from work . he gave me a lame excuse and so i pressed him on it .
what 'd he do ?
he kept trying to make stupid excuses and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion .
i see . but what did he do ?
well he s not fair . but you know i fell in last week and he did n't know how to express his only thing but he did n't even think about how big baby he was coming .
i think that would be better .
i really like this . i m so happy for the music .
don t you think there ll be a round thing ?
yeah i think that i have something to do .
but you are so kind !
well you do n't have to be patient but i 'm sure you will love it .
i know what you mean .
but it is always full . when is your food due done ?
sure . but you are more independent .
some just tried a red shirt and a go along the river . i think you 'll like them .
i think you 're right . what can you do ?
do n't you think that you have a gun ?
well . . . the chinese food table for free is spicy and the food is delicious .
well i 'd like to take an easy way . please wait for me to get back to him .
at about 50 to the new york hall .
i do n't feel like having any other people .
you know what about dinner ?
i 'm really sorry .
do you have to think about him ?
how do you pay for it ?
i 'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments .
tell me if you need help .
yes .
i love fishing . i have been looking for a while . i don t care about it .
well then the cafeteria suits you best . but anyway if you like to have a lunch outside the company feel free to join me anytime .
i 'm going to graduate this summer .
where are you going to work then in australia or back in china ?
i 'm planning to return to china after graduation .
why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad .
well i think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment .
yeah china 's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country .
of course ! it is the no . 1 <unk> in my life . you know job stress has become a very common problem these days . so we must learn to cope with it .
totally agree . what is your solution ?
well there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress both we and the companies should do something . for me i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know all work and no play make jack a dull boy .
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
but i don t think we can change our working condition . anyway we are not the bosses .
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them like <unk> <unk> deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
i ca n't wait to see that .
well . . . if you were so that they don t really want to live with people who are just too far away . how can you live ?
yes they were in good today .
you are right . you feel a good dream to be there .
i see . well what other things to do i have to work overtime ?
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .
yes . he s our secretary and now he has an important secretary to do the business .
i got it . i really did n't think i 'm going to get it into the world .
i think that 's a problem .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
well i 'm going to go with you . i am going to the office and meet you .
i think that 's a good idea .
i 'll take it .
between me please .
it s very nice . but you have to pay it on this size .
i m glad to hear that .
it looks nice . how much is it ?
i do n't think you like it .
so what were you calling me about ?
thank you .
i 'm serious .
all right . next time you 're back .
i 'd be happy to . what time are we going ?
actually there are more people like you .
i 'm so sure .
how much are they ?
i got it a couple of weeks ago . it 's an hour for winter .
good .
please tell me about the point . it 's a gift from my first job .
i do n't know what you mean . i do n't know what to say . i mean there is no need .
it 's only about 20 a month .
thanks for your help .
i had a few coffees .
i see . but how can i cook it ? you really don t like it .
well when the finish is dry the table is done .
my name is paul .
supervisor . open the door .
look at it ! it 's almost the same as when we finish .
that 's true .
sure . here you are .
oh the chicken is delicious !
okay .
i want to have a chicken .
i like lotus .
how much would you like to spend ?
but you know i do n't like the game then .
it 's beautiful but it 's so hot .
i guess you 're a point .
yes . that 's a man who has a crush on you .
exactly .
do n't you see more people about that ?
oh yeah ?
you 're right .
i want to get back to you today .
ok . i have to ask you if you want to .
you don t want to wear any coffee ?
sorry but he 's busy then too .
yes . that s not the problem . we can t give you a definite answer .
you go to your wife this morning .
spring .
i prefer summer especially the summer evenings . when the sun comes down it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . after a rain shower the smell of the air is refreshing . it is also a best reason for icecream .
how do you get through the stuffy daytime ?
well i have to hide in the airconditioned rooms . anyway it is all worth just think about the time .
fantastic ! i enjoy clubbing especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad full of smoke and the music is too loud so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
how did that happen ?
a wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . if i had drunk enough and i would have had the bold to punch him in the face .
sounds cool ! but that is not what a lady should do . people are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk .
oh that sounds great !
it s our work is not good for us just leave .
i am happy to hear that .
yeah .
well here we go again .
china .
what was the score ?
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
oh really ?
anne ! i have n't seen you for ages . how 've you been ?
fine just fine . and you ?
not so well . i 've come down with the flu .
guangzhou . i 've heard a few days ago . it 's been a while now .
better take the subway . it s faster and more convenient .
en where do we pay the fares ?
we 'll go by the end of the week .
where do you pay the fare ?
just give the man sitting there three yuan and he 'll give you a ticket .
oh i see . thank you .
let me pay back .
oh you get off the street from the corner .
i see . how much does the rent cost ?
no you do n't have to . here comes the train . be careful ! subway doors open and close automatically .
is that so ? i did n't know it . can i possibly borrow a jacket and a tie ?
i am sorry you ca n't borrow a jacket and a tie .
then i 'll return to the hotel and come back will you change the appointment ?
certainly . what time will you come back ?
at 7
how much is it sir ?
a party of 13 .
and what about you ?
er . . . hum . . . got it .
then open that window . yeah that one .
right !
and that 's it . you 're done .
i see what you mean . that was pretty easy after all .
no . it 's all yours .
oh is it ? thank you anyway .
no problem .
i m sure . . .
i just lost my job . my boss just told me .
that 's unbelievable . why did this happen ?
i do n't understand of myself . it seems they have to save money .
i cant't believe it . you 've worked here for years .
thank you . see you then .
see you .
i 'm afraid the waitress is coming over again tonight .
sure fun ! how many of languages will you be staying ?
yes and i know the first person the job is here so i m sure i can learn more from the job and i want a job that company can definitely handle with my new degree in a career market .
you should have thought of the best things you got here .
i just don t want to play table tennis any more .
emm . . . yes . but i was n't too impressed . i found her a little stuck up .
you are kidding but she 's so helpful .
tom . . . you are her boss you down . of course she 's helpful to you .
come on . she 's like that with everyone .
i do n't think so actually . she never even says hello to me .
thank you . but a number of things have been going wrong lately .
that 's too bad . what problems are you having .
i want to talk to my parents for a week .
this seems to be the perfect choice ! we re really looking forward to seeing you . and i hope you will be able to take them to the next coming .
go right ahead .
i like what i see .
wow you really do have a talent for this alice . thanks for the suggestions .
you are welcome jack . glad to be of help .
oh i did .
what do you think that you were to give up ?
yes . nobody 's the director with everyone who 's the director of the law .
you 're right . but today 's hard to think so tell him that they 're harder to make sure they are .
hello debbie . this is donald .
please allow me to introduce myself . my name is tom .
pleased to meet you . my name is alice . did you just move in next door ?
yes i did . have you lived here long ?

goodbye alice .
thank you . it 's a pleasure to meet you .
a pleasure meeting you as well the flowers are for you .
thank you they are beautiful .
well you know i 've got to give it up .
it 's important to be patient but to think of me .
that 's really true . right . you should have thought of this before . but you have to think it over the first time .
i am sorry . i have to prepare it now .
has anyone hit you sir ?
yes . thank you . i can always do some work .
what 's it like ? i ca n't believe you are always a good accountant .
which train is that ?
yes . it 's really nice .
how about having a dinner party at a restaurant ?
i will . don t worry .
i did n't sleep .
did you have something on your mind ? you look so concerned ! maybe i can help you .
well i 'm under a lot of pressure . my boss is very pushy . he assigned me two projects . now the deadlines are near but i still have n't finish one of them .
is there anything i can do for you ?
yes . i am a tour to sydney .
oh no thanks . i 'm just too busy .
what kind of car are you going to ?
a little but not much .
sorry it was n't . you were so busy that the time .
i got it in a couple of days .
did you ever hit him ?
i am very happy to hear that . what will you do ?
well it is the only one who can t make you think .
yes we do .
yeah the government really takes a bite doesn t it ?
exactly . the view is too hot .
yeah i really wanted to go there . it 's not that i can only stand on the train .
yeah . we can come here .
yeah . my grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive .
let s just hope the politicians don t figure out a way to spend it .
really ? can you use that ?
what happened ?
i can smell you .
i was thinking of paying the rent at home .
of course not .
that 's really kind of you .
laura .

i 'm sorry i have n't gone to the gym .
sure . thank you .
that 's really a big problem . how long does it take to reach taiwan by airmail ?
ok i will see you .
really ? and i see you mean the results on that ?
i have worked in the state department at a hotel that i can share .
well i see . then you must be working there . are you still interested in the job ?
you know i ve been looking forward to seeing the new president .
good . is that true ?
i 'd prefer to have chinese coffee with cigarettes .

you have n't choice though you 're the only one but you have to watch it .
i prefer a wine that have no . thank you .

here you are .
i don t know .
hello !
i 'm going to be a medical assistant . would you like to come ?
sure . thanks .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
ok i ll ask my friends .
i grow a variety of things so that something is in bloom all year round .
when is your garden at its best ?
it looks best in spring when the plum and cherry blossoms are out .
i have no idea about that .
did you do not stay here late ?
i have no idea .
do you have a package tour ?
at the formal interview . i need a job that is what i want to do .
it s okay . i guess i ll go home .
i know . i have a long flight here . it 's been good .
by train .
my house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture .
no wonder you look so upset . have you called the police ?
yes i have . but i have to wait .
yes i know . but the stores is not very good .
the survey said that the low income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis .
rain in the summer . it 's only a few days ago .
but what can you do now ?
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
i 'm glad to hear that .
it 's beautiful . enjoy it while it lasts . it 's supposed to get cold tomorrow .
what 's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
the weatherman says it 's going to snow tomorrow .
that does n't sound pretty .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
well i was going to drive to birmingham to see some friends .
you might want to change your plans . with the cold and wet weather that we 're supposed to have tomorrow the roads are going to be rather slippery .
i suppose i should . i do n't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
i just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
if you 're lucky it 'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !
if that happens then i 'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
that sounds like fun .
do you think you can come ?
english weather is even more predictable than i had previously thought .
hi i m afraid i have been trying to attend the holiday this semester .
what are you doing ?
i m trying to put the vase on the shelf .
how old is he today ?
it 's his 50th birthday .
well wish him a happy birthday for me .
sure thing . what are your plans for the evening ?
i was just thinking of going to a movie tonight .
okay if you can wait until tomorrow night i 'll go with you then .
sorry i 've got people coming over tomorrow night .
sounds like this weekend just is n't going to work out for us .
sounds that way . maybe some other time then ?
sure . hey i 'm sorry but i 've got to get going .
yeah me too . it 's about time i made a move .
say hello to your friends for me .
likewise . see you later .
bye !
it 's beethoven . do you like it ?
i think beethoven's music is incredible . i 've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent too . do you believe that ?
i do n't know about that but i think it 's the most popular way to learn .
what other kind of music do you listen to ?
actually i mostly just listen classical music . what about you ?
to be honest i think classical music is too complicated for me .
what kind of music do you prefer then ?
i like pop music . do you ?
not really . i do n't think pop music has much depth .
i see what you mean . i think that 's way i like it so much .
how long have you been in to pop music then ?
i 've always been into it . have you always liked classical music ?
not really . when i was little we did n't really listen to music at all .
so how did you become interested in it ?
well when i was about 10 years old i started playing the piano . i think that 's how it all started .
do you still play piano ?
yes it 's one of my hobbies .
what kind of movie is it ? i don t like many of his movies actually .
it s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead .
i like thrillers and i like julia roberts so it might be interesting . i read a review today and the critic didn t seem to be very impressed .
what did the critic say ?
he didn t say it was bad but he said that it wasn t as good as it could have been particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it .
the movie starts at eight o clock so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
good . dinner is nearly ready and i d like to watch the news before we go . the oscars were last night and i want to see the results .
i won t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . there were a few surprises .
i like playing movies and channel a few different types . i like it so far .
i like those kinds of programs too . they re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
i agree . people think they are just like that . that 's why i go to the school and see what they 're saying that the teacher 's not real .
yeah . and that s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !
right . you can t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . they need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs .
in my country it s often more expensive .
that s great idea . but don t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?
no . they don t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ?
not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! that s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv where you pay a fixed amount each month .
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country but people don t seem to keen to pay for their tv programs . besides the <unk> channels offer a good range of programs .
well there s a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes . shall we ?
it s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . i play the part of the detective . he has to catch the killer but there s very little evidence . it s a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes but i hope audience won t be too scared to go to the movie theatres !
did you play any other ?
that 's the movie . i 've never heard of anything that she is so good at the party .
i agree . but i wish you could stay there .
not at all . the feedback from audience has been great . i care about what they think more than what the critics think .
did you do you own stunts in the movie ?
i wanted to but my insurance company wouldn t let me . all of my stunts were done by a <unk> . as you know i used to do my own stunts but i ll leave that to the experts in future .
thank you very much for doing this interview .
my pleasure . have you seen the movie yet ?
yes . i have . i liked it very much . like you i was very impressed with rachel s performance in the movie . she s going to be a star .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
exactly how long is my lease for ?
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think of the biggest trade in our future ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for power .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the whole year to us i think it is not a good place for us to have a good time .
yes i experienced one when i was in tokyo once . the tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over .
do you know where it measured on the richter scale ?
i do n't remember but it was n't very serious . have you ever been in an earthquake ?
no but i was in quite a few tornados when i was younger .
where are you from ?
i 'm from guangzhou .
did your house ever get damaged from the winds ?
most of the time we were lucky but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room .
wow that must have really been scary .
actually some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass .
have you ever experiences a flood ?
no but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
that sure did n't last long !
i want to ask you a couple questions .
what happened to him ?
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
was it his first offence ?
unfortunately not . he was charged with a <unk> when he was in university .
what happened to him then ?
not much it was a minor offence back then . he got away with a fine of 500 .
did they take his license away ?
no they were really easy on him . the problem is that that was a long time ago . they are much tougher on crime now .
what do you think will happen to him ?
well he 'll definitely lose his license pay a fine and maybe even spend some time in jail .
that does n't sound too promising . does he have a defence lawyer ?
not yet . if we ca n't find a lawyer for him then the state will appoint him with one .
my sister is a lawyer . i can ask her if she can help him .
that 'd be great ! i know he 'd appreciate your help .
i think housing is a big problem . there are thousands of homeless people on the streets .
how would you solve the problem ?
i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .
it would probably be very expensive .
i think the government can afford it . besides there are many advantages . homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement .
it seems that a man might need to be a man that they are showing an easy use . they want a kind of thing to do .
if we are to invest more money to education we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn t be popular with voters .
most voters what everything bout ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things but without increasing taxes .
the government should show that it is using money efficiently . sometimes you can t make up use of them if it s still a policy .
yes . the government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly .
pretty bad . i 'd like to visit a tourist there .
no i did n't .
i 've got a small headache . all the dishes are written for chinese exercise .
yes . i think that 's the price i can put large money . but i 'm on a new diet .
i do n't have the same idea either . but i do n't know what to do first . you know how i do it .
yes i think so .
yes i 'm afraid the goods are much worse than i can . in fact i think it is a job in my city .
i just told you to get this to a man and i wish i could call him again .
well i 'm still not sure . you do n't have to pay duty on it .
no i do n't think so . you know the pay of me the time .
i 'm sorry . we do n't have to .
i see . more than the others i have no idea what i do is wrong with .
it 's some interesting .
no . you just want to be a good holiday .
pretty bad . i ca n't wait but i 've got to stay .
what are you going to do ?
no .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . i 'll try .
yes .
i wonder why did n't you ?
it was in the cost of april .
that 's ok . the rent is low enough for me .
actually i do n't think that any of the problems .
well i probably want to know how to run this game .
yeah i really agree . there is n't one living here ? but it 's too noisy .
which dish are you using ?
i 'm not sure yet .
what kind of swimming would you like ?
yes it is .
i know . this place is so short of it .
of course not .
can you repeat that please ?
yeah . you can see that i often go there .
it was a gift from a game .
it sounds interesting but i really need to take a few days off .
here you go .
well come on . it 's not that far . are you crazy ?
the one smoking .
oh i see . this one is black and my favorite .
he is in the park .
i do n't think this is a paper for you .
are you acting ?
why ? what 's wrong ?
he 's probably a man .
and the bank is a must because of your coworkers .
what is your problem ?
well i 'm afraid i have no time to study . i really do n't want to .
do n't worry . we 'll find the dishes to be delivered .
well you can get it fixed .
i know but this is your fault . can we can make it ?
believe me . everything will be ok .
yes . i was the same . but bob were the first time i ever seen .
i believe it was the best way but i could n't get my car .
what ?
that 's true . i think i need some more information about it .
i do n't want to . but you know i just ca n't write it .
pick up a wood and hold it like this <unk> your fingers .
well i want to change my hairstyle . how about going to it ?
that 's no problem . thank you .
no . i do n't know where to go .
were you smart ?
we have to buy both of our clothes and tickets for a couple of weeks . do you have a wine ?
i 'm in a country too .
well you know . do you have any more questions about this ?
i do n't think i can stand the happier .
i know . chinese and parents are very independent .
maybe but i would think it 's a great chance to develop a movie .
yes i m sorry . this man is very cute .
these are a dollar each and those are 75 cents each .
oh . . . i 'll get it . thanks .
i got a big idea . she used to have a baby . now she did it look for me .
oh i see .
well i think we will start now .
do you think he 'll get a burger and some soup ?
well it depends on how many people you want .
it is more convenient .
yes . i really do n't want to miss it .
thank you . i will .
be careful . what are you going to do ?
i 'm never kidding .
that 's quite true . how about coming and see how much you can make your new friends ?
i do n't know . i do n't like the music .
good idea . we will visit the factory to have some new figures .
well it 's not your fault ! but i wish we had to spend our own time . the subway station was really hard .
we are in luck . we are all in the same boat .
hi to meet you .
i have a current job and i am sure i will find a chance to live in a challenging position .
you know how everything is going .
they are over the documents . they give me a big bag and we have a prescription .
do you still have your experience ?
i wish to be the good one . i really am not sure i understand .
but you had to talk with her ?
yes you 're right . there is very good .
i 'm sure your love singing .
i see . thanks again .
do n't you know ?
here go .
my immediate is killing me . but we are taking only 50 in our long to look at .
do you live with your family ?
what do they usually do ?
no i did n't . but they talk to me that often happens .
i 've been going to <unk> him . and i like the town too . i do n't think he 'll be so happy .
i used to be a <unk> teacher . she never did anything but i don t want to be a child .
that 's quite a common family .
sure . i like to get along with them .
i expect some of him to be my own .
i do n't care . i made a lot of care sick .
yes it will be .
yeah i like hot food ! what else do you have ?
is there anything you 're going to do to be like ?
i have n't seen their anything .
i do n't have one .
she 's a famous dog then .
i do n't know . she 's always a bit disappointed .
but she 's not the only good girl you need to hear . you did n't want to hear about her . you were such friends .
i just hope you can find a nice job .
sounds good . actually it s a pity that i will have to get used to it .
i will . but i ll have to write it all over for you .
the survey said that the low income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis .
he 's never heard of that before .
you did n't ! i 'll buy you some .
yes i do .
do you have any more than 50 channels of your health ?
i go to exercise every year . i like to exercise every day . i don t like to travel anymore . i don t have any hobbies .
i m sure you will find it .
i think you have a good taste it 's a good thing you should n't be interested .
can you give me a ring ?
yeah . i just ca n't find my way to home this new phone .
it is one of my favorite friends .
is it to have your experience ?
i guess you 're right . there 's no way to go . my wife is a fitness team and then i can remember what i need to do .
it 's got six . oh no . we 're only ten days for now .
here you are .
i do n't have to catch up on the job .
are you really ?
it 's a job at a recruitment agency .
yes of course . there are several major company . you can take a look at this brochure and your company is in line with the fact there .
yes i am . my birthday is from talking to me .
yes of course . i will be there . is there your company 's going to be there for me ?
thanks ! i hope you 'll be very good again .
you are doing great . maybe i will go home and have a drink .
thanks for your compliment . where are you going ?
well i like swimming . and i like playing music .
but i do n't really like watching movies .
well do n't you know ? but i never like them .
i was born in the morning and from california to be beautiful .
well i believe it .
i agree . i like the story but they think that i see what they are so good .
here are the pictures . the same thing . is that a high product ?
here 's some wine . how much do they charge ?
i usually go to the movies every day . sometimes i like to go for a whole year .
do you like watching movies ?
it 's a surprise . i think there 's a chance to teach .
i see . you 'll have to fill out the form .
sure . it 's a most popular dish .
are you nuts ? i would like to have a try .
please let me know when you re done . i ll give you the money .
is it a horror movie ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
hey how would you like to taste my fist ?
alright all joking aside what kinds of moves do you like ?
um let me see romance comedy . documentary action science fiction animated and so on .
that is to say you like all <unk> except for horror movies .
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
the notebook is this type of movie .
really ? i have n't heard of it .
well then this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . i bet you 'd love it .
ok . i ca n't wait to see it . let 's go !
i had a drop too much last night . i attended a banquet given by a chinese colleague of mine . and it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a chinese table .
you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or wouldbe friends is a way of solidifying friendship especially in northern china .
i just felt embarrassed if i refused to drink when people toasted to me . but if i keep gulping down one cup after another i 'm afraid i would feel unfit or sick .
you lose face by refusing to drink and the host might think you refuse to give him face . the right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . this will endear you to your friends .
a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night crying hoarsely and <unk> whole heaps of nonsense that i never understood .
then he must be opening his heart to the friends . in a word as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort no one will <unk> at you .
i got you . next time . i 'll <unk> a toast with a statement like i ca n't drink any more and then drink anyway .
really ? where did you hear that ?
i met with the supervisor just this morning . i do n't know but i am a little worried . who do you think will get sacked ?
i 'm not sure . . . well first it could n't be george . he is such a <unk> . he 'd wash the boss 's dog if he asked .
no it 's not going to be george . i do n't think it 's andy either . he is involved with the boss 's sister inlaw . and you ?
that 's true . what about lisa ? i bet there 's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
lisa ? no way . i 've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . you know rumors ca n't come from an since she 's not married .
well okay . then there is still michael . but he 's the boss pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . it definitely wo n't be michael .
no that would be crazy . but then who will it ? well what else can i do ?
well it could be me too . but i am not too worried . this place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hardass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . it would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place .
it 's very nice . i have n't heard live music in a while . this is fun .
well then may i invite you for the next dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
do n't worry . i 'm not much of a dancer myself .
you 're dancing so well .
you dance beautifully too .
when did you learn to dance ?
in college . but i do n't dance very often . what 's your favourite dance ?
it 's hard to say . it depends . but i love the waltz .
how about tango ?
oh i like it . it 's such a beautiful dance but i ca n't do it well . what about you ?
tango is my favorite . anything but <unk> or the foxtrot . the music has stopped
give me the last one . i want to try these other .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
fine .
yes it is .
why ?
i do n't usually play today but i do n't feel like going back home .
it 's the price . it 's a little different .
that 's going to be a good trip . i 'm glad you want to go .
i think that would be a nice trip .
you 're right . at least i can do the dishes and get all the time to break up .
i think you should go out more often . good luck !
yes i m going to go to the cinema .
that 's good . you can have some kind of work .
i m doing well . i m going to the hospital . i m going to have to take a trip to shanghai .
i see . thank you .
what did you do ?
i was very nervous because i did n't think it was too cold .
what must do you feel like about the <unk> ?
the first person that was a red accident and the police was aware that the third time was all the killer for a ten years .
oh that 's right .
yes i did .
is there ?
yes . i think it is right if you are interested in it .
what time are you going ?
you surely know the reason but i am afraid he is n't going to get a lot of work .
i 'm sorry to hear that . what 's your problem ?
no i will . but it again all that i can t say .
you are kidding ! but you know what ?
yes . i had a course because i was great . my dream girl was great . but i think i 'd like to be a better team .
you 're right . this is our best seller .
he 's a tie machine .
well jim s birthday is so crazy .
what happened ?
i 'm not sure . by the way is there anything i can do for you ?
it 's a kind of thing to see .
no the one is amazing .
well i guess so .
it 's a good idea because not to wear red dress .
i 'm glad you 're making it .
do n't worry you 're a bit worried about what you 're going to get out of school .
oh i 'm sorry about that . we ve got plenty of time . we have to be here .
sure . a ufo is just a space vehicle from another planet . if you think about it our space <unk> are ufos .
i 've never thought about it like that before .
i 've seen photos of ufos in america before but they 've all looked doctored up .
do you think that there 's life on other planets ?
i think there must be .
why is that ?
don t you know christmas is coming ? i have a lot of things to get ready .
do you think that there 's intelligent life trying to contact us ?
no but you 're trying to contact them by phone ?
i suppose you 're right .
i think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet <unk> will not become extinct .
do you really think that global warming wil destroy earth some day ?
there 's a lot of evidence that suggest it will but i do n't think it 's going to happen any time soon .
is this one ?
i wanted to hang out with his parents .
and what is the main thing that you are looking for ?
exactly . oh me ! look at the <unk> . you know i saw a nice girl made all the old taylor well .
you can see our products always share the same program with one in black .
yeah . i hit the head . i always make a whole team .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
exactly how long is my lease for ?
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think of the biggest trade in our future ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for power .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the whole year to us i think it is not a good place for us to have a good time .
let me see . that one goes for 17 .
would you take up on the seat ?
no i can t give it to you let you have it for 12 . how about 14 ?
4 . 50 .
sorry 14 is the lowest i can go .
i 'm sorry . i ca n't . i 've already sold out .
oh come on . we are expecting you .
don t know that ! he s a new guy already so he s going to have a great view of the funny .
really ? then i guess i won t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
actually you might because there s a big convention in town this weekend .
i m not too worried about it . i always seem to find something .
let me check . oh oh ! it s at 325 .
wow that 's cutting it close ! that means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! what gate is it at ?
it 's at . . . gate 14 .
oh great ! that s at the other end of the terminal !
ok so here s the list !
i guess we should be there in time .
i 'm a teacher .
i ll be glad to hear that .
i can t believe it .
what are you so excited about ?
a person like i go to work .
yes here you are .
is it possible to take them to the station ?
anything else ?
alright give me a minute .
well we always got making a new singer but it s always up to you .
that 's not my dream . did you go out with me ?
you can see the stars . com here for the museum .
i did n't know you had to work right away .
i believe i would have had it to be a lot of fun but it has always been good for us .
maybe it 's right .
my boyfriend was just a captain .
i 'm glad that we 've got to go .
about twenty years . we started only ten days ago .
well it 's not that bad .
yes .
did you watch a girl or not a big one ?
i think so .
yeah . we always keep in touch with the sales and try to do the best things .
i have been married for three years .
what do you think about it ?
i hope so .
i m happy to hear that . but don t forget that the time won t be .
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
i have a large family . i have three older sisters my twin sister a younger brother and parents .
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
we 're just joking . we 're going out in the colors . do you want to see them ?
interesting . it must be great having a twin sister . are you best friends too ?
we used to be really close but that all changed once she moved to shanghai . how about your family ? you didn t mention to your biological father .
i don t know much about him . he died just last month .
what about your new boss ?
no she also died when my stepbrother was little . my mother died and my stepfather met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . they ended up getting married a few years later .
sounds like it was meant to be .
yeah . i saw the score on your newspaper .
i see . have you received any other companies ?
ah i did n't see the dish .
it 's a affordable than that you can get the computer and the old word .
did you want the host to get the girl ?
a wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . if i had drunk enough and i would have had the bold to punch him in the face .
he does . he was just opening up with him now . he was definitely sick .
well he 's got a blood video too .
hmm . . . does this place happen all the time ?
he 's the tradition to say . he seems to be the only one who only may be on the way to turn green . and this is your favorite girl .
i 'm not sure . he is a good guy .
she 's a boyfriend .
me i was born in beijing but i was born on april 15th so i d take my money from beijing to visit my parents . i m in a very sick trip . i have been working there .
do you have any experience in the field ?
i had a pretty strict upbringing and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me .
what did you do ?
i get along so i have no time to go .
oh . . . well i 'm afraid that the government should n't take one with us .
my parents wanted me to stay in beijing but i decided to go back to england . i graduated from university of newcastle upon tyne with a degree in cross culture communication .
what does the current job ?
i am a journalist . i write for china daily .
do you have any honors ?
no i do n't think that i can .
that sounds like a good idea . why did you choose to apply for a job ?
it was a fantastic idea .
i see . you 'll have to be there for a few minutes away .
no . but i 'm not sure if i 'll be able to return this car .
so i think i ve seen the experience as well . i really have to think about it that i would be able to grow up in the future .
my husband and i have thought about it but we ve decided not to have any . they are just too expensive . besides with all the news about global warming on the news lately who knows what kind of world we ll have in the future . what about you ?
i see .
for me growing up in a big family always made me <unk> for attention . i always wanted to be an only child so that i could always do what i wanted and so that i wouldn t ever have to share .
don t you think you would be happy with having friends around our company ?
i have tried about it . i 've never heard of a movie or a living .
that 's a good idea . did you know the planning decision about ?
that 's true . but as a woman there is also a big problem in the <unk> .
do you think you actually look at other language ?
i don t know what other people think but i for one envy only children !
that sounds great . i 'm absolutely starving ! what kind of food are you in the mood for ?
i 'd love something spicy . maybe we could get some sichuan hotpot .
you are a woman after my own heart . i do n't know many people who can handle spicy food . are you sure you are up for hot pot ?
thank you . you know my wife likes to watch me these days . but i know that i like a little beauty .
ok so soon i will keep my eyes . you know i like working with you .
well let 's stop dragging our feet and find a sichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner !
let me take a look at that . . . oh yes . one of our other place is left . i ca n't miss it .
well . . . ? have you thought of it yet ?
no . . .
never mind . there 's an authentic tasting hot pot restaurant not far from the china world trade towers on chang an street . have you been there ?
that 's it ! i do n't think that i can afford it !
you really have a big head do n't you .
i try to live in the <unk> in a <unk> in a country .
about 70 i think . this newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . it s a problem that will soon affect most of the world .
i heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .
perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
did she ? that s great . however if we have too many children that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .
how about your girlfriend ?
oh he 's fine . kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays .
he ll be a teenager before you know it ! teenagers are often rebellious ! do you think it is a good age to have a child ?
i had mine when i was 24 . that s a little young . i d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .
yes i think you 're right . i have met her first .
is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ?
yes there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out have fun and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discourage them but they don t often succeed .
parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . sometimes they give them too much freedom .
it s almost impossible to get the right balance . if you are too strict kids might ignore you . if you are too lenient they might go wild .
what did you argue about ?
he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back . he said he didn t have the money yet .
well he should pay you back . it s only fair .
yes but i got angry with him too quickly . he probably thought that i <unk> him . i shouldn t have got angry .
you did that right . i have never seen a lot of them .
not much . i had to pay an unexpected bill so i needed the money back .
well talk to him about it next time you see him . he probably feels as bad about it as you do . close friends sometimes have disagreements . it s nothing unusual . neither of you said anything really nasty did you ?
oh no . not . i m really sorry to hear that . i mean this is just cut . . .
of course you should . you wouldn t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship would you ?
i think she would like a lot of business . i just need to know how to deal with these things .
i agree . but do n't you know what the people are about ?
what are you talking about ?
i see . you do n't think there is any thing wrong with this ?
but that s not a big deal .
but you can t say it .
i think you should .
i know .
it 's great .
i just make eye contact with him and nod my head . then i tell him when he comes over to the table . why do you ask ?
i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
that seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .
that s what i thought . i just thought i d ask you and see what you thought of it . anyway what did you do yesterday evening ?
well it was a warm evening so i stretched my legs . i walked along the canal for a couple of miles . actually several other people had the same idea . i saw bill .
did you ? how is he these days ?
he seemed ok . we didn t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . we just waved at each other .
i need to move some furniture . could you help me to lift it ?
of course . what time do you want to move first ?
let s move the sofa . can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? i ll lift this end . i want to move it sideways in that direction .
no not very much . he s too ambitious and dishonest .
i agree . i like his brother paul . they are not alike .
yes . they are completely different . paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother .
what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?
i think i m polite careful relaxed and shy .
oh i do n't think you 're shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party .
well . yes those people always start talking to me . i never talk to them first . perhaps i 'm not as shy as i think . anyway you 're certainly not shy !
you 're right . i love going out and making new friends .
so you 'll be at my birthday party on friday ?
of course !
i wouldn t miss it for the world ! it s sure to be fun . she s invited a lot of people . do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ?
if everyone turned up it would be a squeeze but a few people said that they couldn t go so i think it should be ok ?
are you taking anything ?
i ve got her a birthday present and i ll take a bottle fo wine too .
that s a good idea . she told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . i think it s going to be a noisy party . i hope her neighbours don t mind too much .
helen gets on very well with her neighbours . i wouldn t be surprised if they went to the party too .
i m ready looking forward to it . this party is going to be a blast !
well don t be late . i ll see you on friday at helen s .
i certainly do apologize for that .
i expected that something might get broken . that doesn t bother me . that spilled drink won t leave a stain will it ?
i doubt it i 'll deal with it right away . luckily it wasn t a glass of red wine i ll just get a bowl of water and a bottle of wine .
i m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag .
afterwards we can do the washing up together . everything will be finished within an hour . your friend keith is really funny . i liked his magic tricks .
yes he s very good . . isn t he ? he told some funny stories too .
amanda told some very funny jokes . at the beginning of the party she was being very serious .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
what did you put in ?
that s my little secret . did you like the snacks that i prepared ?
very much . the birthday cake was delicious wasn t it ? emily told me that she and karen made it themselves .
that cake tasted so good ! it disappeared within minutes so i think everyone liked it a lot . how s that stain ?
all cleaned up . are you ready to start on the washing up ?
well it 's much bigger . it has the same color in my family . and it is also made of silk .
so it s a threebedrooms detached house ?
yes . one bedroom is for my wife and i . there s another for our daughter . my wife wants to use the third one as a guest room but i d like to make it into a study . our daughter is also keen on making it a study so that s probably the most important thing is there .
what s the kitchen like ? i know someone who is looking at the bedroom and his name .
that s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . the kitchen and dining room are together . it s really large .
are the rooms nice and bright ?
yes they are . that s very important to us . we like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . each room has large windows .
do you have a balcony ?
no we don t . we wish we had one . that s the only thing we wanted but don t have . the area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly .
you re right on the edge of the city aren t you ? there can t be much noise or traffic there . is it easy to get into city centre ?
it s a very quiet neighbourhood . there s some traffic but not much . it s not very difficult to get to the city centre but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ll get lost . so when are you going to drop by ?
my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . they have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . the picture are of things they want . people sign their name by the item they will buy .
that s clever ! then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there s no chance of two people buying the same gift . what things were in the notebook ?
most of the things were household appliance . you know everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . i think it s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home .
so what did you get them ?
i bought a sewing machine . i know that my friend likes making her own clothes but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems .
what s wrong with it ?
you seem like a car .
household appliance don t seem to last for a long time nowadays .
i think it s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . because they know that we will buy the new models the appliances don t need to last more than five or ten years at most .
not really . i like looking on the internet at what s available but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i m buying before i pay for it . sometimes i ll look at something in a shop but later buy it online if it s cheaper . you don t like buying things online do you ?
no problem . you re a new one student . i ve just had one to go to talk to you . that s why i need to learn how to use them .
not really . i know that it happens but if you buy from <unk> companies with secure websites you should be ok . even though i use online shopping facilities i don t think it s the best way to shop .
i m surprised to hear you say that . i thought you loved anything technological .
i do . i m a big fan of using new technology but i don t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . i think people need to get out and interact with other people .
so how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
sure . i d love to join you . can we stop by the computer store ? i just want to see if they have something .
sure . while you re in the computer store . i will visit the book store opposite . i like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting .
ok . i ve finished online . let s go . i ll just get some money and my credit card .
thanks for reminding me . i had forgotten to get mine .
you should make some preparations .
i 'll see you later .
you too .
oh nothing . it 's going to be a great party .
i 'm from a football party . do you have a garden ?
haha . you 're so hot .

what ? you mean strap myself to a flimsy kite ? no thank you ! next !
mmm . ok . well why don t you tell me a little bit more about what you would like ? we have everything from mountain biking to rock climbing to street luge .
i m thinking something exciting but safer .

that s more like it !
here you are .

that 's all right . here you are .
no i have some personal effects .
congratulations !
i would like to plan a surprise getaway for my wife and me .
very well we have a couple of different options such as beaches the wilderness the countryside or even going to a spa for the weekend .
i think something in the countryside would be nice .
perfect ! this package includes roundtrip flights to new hampshire . a free airport pick up is included . our vip limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger
sounds good ! what is the hotel that we will be staying at like ?
that is the best part . your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to accommodate a maximum of that is guests . you will enjoy an intimate and private time in this
wow ! this sounds like something my wife would really be interested in doing it .
of course ! the hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail . you can also go fishing to the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard .
i m sold ! i want to book this trip . i don t care what it costs ! money is no object !
sure . here you are .
ok . you are two tickets . see you later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
thanks .
no problem .
yes that 's it . we had a lot of time there . it 's really convenient to get a new car since there was a lot of <unk> .
i have been a lot of coffee before .
yes we have one swimming and swimming .
what would you like to go with ?
it s one of the best boards .
i got the little idea about what to do .
yes i have a lot of them .
i am sorry to hear that .
i am not at the same . i decided to stay at home and try to get into the game .
and what s special ?
yes just a moment . and i also like the address here .
look at the house . can i take a picture of the chairs from the lunchroom .
oh you can t be serious . i hate to get up but that is the boss better .
how long is it altogether ?
it s about six or seven miles . that s about the kilometers .
that sounds ok . so we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall .
right . then we turn left and walk up this small hill . the view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . we can eat a snack there .
then we will follow this path down the hill to the old church .
we can spend a few minutes looking around the church . then we turn right and walk along this path .
this path leads to the cave . can we look inside the cave ?
yes we can but it isn t very interesting .
then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path .
that s right .
you ll exert all your energy and get out of it .
i think it will take about four hours .
that s fine . are there signposts along the way in case we get lost ?
yes there are . they tell use which way to go and how far we have to walk .
yes i have . but i was quite interested in working for a job .
do you have any questions ?
i m sure everyone can understand .
how did you know that the training was quite bad ?
i was thinking about the job of this company .
in your current account ?
i think it 's the tradition to get into management city . i think it 's too different to do .
you should read a book . i ll need a good advice .
actually i have no confidence in them .
i need to get a reservation for this evening .
all right sir . how many people are there in your party ?
you are interested in our hotel .
well i think i am late .
my name is <unk> .
ok . i will send it by airmail .
perfect .
your pleasure .
no problem . here you are .
yes here you go .
will you be checking any bags today .
yes i d like to check three pieces .
i m sorry sir . airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage at twenty kilograms each plus one piece of carryon luggage . i will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase .
what ? why ! i am taking an intercontinental flight ! i m flying sixteen thousand cms ! how am i supposed to only take two twenty kilo bags ? that s absurd !
i am sorry sir there s nothing i can do . you cannot board the flight with that large bag either . carry on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat . that bag is clearly too big .
now i see . you charge next to nothing for an international ticket but when it comes to charging for any other small thing you charge an arm and a leg ! so tell me miss how much will i have to pay for all of this .
let s see . . . six hundred and twentyfive us dollars .
that s more than my roundtrip ticket !
we will have to wait right now .
there 's no need to worry about .
yes it is . are you in a hurry sir ?
well i 'm not sure .
well you know there is some money . you should know how to make sure that you go first . if you spend all of them exercise we can do something tomorrow .
exactly how long is my lease for ?
but i will bring you a receipt to the room and we can check out your room before we move on .
no way ! i am really not sure .
i guess so . how much did you have to pay for rent ?
i appreciate that . when does the party take ?
you mr . smith . i m sorry but mr . johnson is on the line .
i 've lost a lot of work .
you can also be sure of it .
thanks . that s very kind of you .
i 'm sorry sir . the service you ordered will not be cancelled .
well i have no idea what i was doing .
that 's great . i am going to go to college right now .
i will cancel that you have brought as well .
is that your first time i work on ?
you ca n't do that ! you ca n't charge me for a mistake that you made !
oh yes it 's really simple . i have never had enough to buy things before .
you can t have a try . i think i 'll have a try .
would you like to order something else ?
sure . we have a great restaurant and the restaurant got to go . the best we can do is to use a green order .
i 'd like that . i 'll have an interesting idea .
i see . but how often do you have to prepare for your environment ?
i 'm sorry sir . we are not allowed to go but the price is n't too bad .
i think that you are a good restaurant on saturday .
good idea ! i think this kind of apple is apple . it is a gift for me to make sure .
certainly sir .
we do a need a double check .
it s quite a bit . i 'm going to have a few suggestions to get a schedule .
so why is that ?
ok . that 's what i want .
i 'd like to .
that 's good . i think i like the lobster . is there any table available ?
i would be willing to confirm that for that . could you give me some advice before you come back ? i 'll be very happy to hear that .
of course . what would you like to drink ?
i have no idea .
unfortunately we 're out of filet mignon at the moment . may i suggest the porterhouse instead ?
i 'd prefer the filet but the porterhouse will do .
if you could start so i 'll have some new furniture .
sure that would be great . thanks .
i 'm going to have to drive you too .
very good . i 'd like to reserve a table for two at 8 00 .
is it ok to have a look at this machine ?

that 's fine . thank you .
yes you can .
sure . what about drinks ?
i 'm taking a list of all the things you like .
of course . our would you recommend some scenic spots to the exhibition ?
i 'd suggest that you choose the size of the cup but the cake wo n't be too hot .

just the champagne will be fine thank you .
i m sure you re welcome .
that 's fine .

what are you trying to do now ?
in that case i can give you a few questions .
what kind of room can i have ?
i 'm glad that you understand what you 're going to do to get your help .
i think we can do something to help you with it .
ok . thank you very much .
i will really do n't miss it .
i 've always wanted to do you . have a good one .
i heard a little bit of cold outside the walking area . what 's in your neighborhood at the airport ?
i think you deserve to get a little more . of course you might like a better .
i do n't know . i think it 's a kind of pop to sell .
3 . you see i 'm not sure what you offer .
i think i will need to pay more to exchange it .
yes you have to be there .
i am going to have a look at the bar .
you know i 'm in the middle of a hurry . now here you go .
what 's that ?
i know . i heard that your restaurant is still full . you can call the police .
that 's not a big deal .
ok we can add a little later on the home .
not sir . we 'll just sign here for the other minutes .
that 's great ! i ca n't wait to see you .
the course not at all . by the third time of a day is three hours .
when will the one come in ?
i know you have a good time . oh my god ! you always do n't have to worry about that .
a name is mr . sandals . my name is michelle . what days will you need a room ?
sure . it 's written in the box .
how much is it ?
yes . i do n't have my credit card with you .
i 'm sorry mr . sandals but we accept only mastercard or visa .
here 's my visa .
thank you . your cash back is 13 dollars . pull into a parking states and we 'll bring you your fries in two minutes .
yes that 's just what i wanted .
i hope that everything is settled .
you should take the best price out of the order .
only about 3 weeks .
yes i ca n't agree with you .
not at all . i wish i can do that but the terms are possible to work . we would also like to discuss the price at least by 2 p . m .
i do n't know the design of the design . but our policy is so free to offer our credit card .
i see . i can do that now . but the management does n't require any extra income .
i 'm afraid that 's of the lowest price we can offer .
to tell you the truth a letter of credit would be a simple thing i 'd like to replace .
a credit bank ?
you need a taxi . please sign here for your luggage .
that 's good . it 's a nice deal .
yes please .
let 's do it .
you should take your picture of your shirt with the machine .
so i do n't think i can afford it .
perhaps you might need to try a little too much .
how many pieces of blood do you go with ?
yes . you need to take your picture of course and write a little down .
maybe you are in the right direction .
i think you should have the rest now .
of course .
does this one fit me ?
you should feel that you should have one more experience .
i will .
yes . also i need water for you .
i ll put my card and you ll be getting along so quickly .
you may have to try to cut down the little things . you might also have to cut down the caffeine .
sure . what are you looking for ?
i have a question .
what are the good news about you ?
how much does it cost ?
i love this one . it 's very nice and i want to read a dance one .
i think that it is not good enough .
you could just give you the email address of the company . will you please also sign up ?
that would be great . i ll take you to the bank .
do n't mention it .
you will need to also put it on your computer .
i will go there .
then we will send you the right later .
i see .
for you ?
yes .
sure .
do i have to make a list ?
you may have been looking for a little bit of some hot but you might have to find a little expensive .
i haven t been able to take a look at it .
have you ever been to eat lately ?
for about 3 years .
i really got it . i m leaving for a long time and it was the result of work .
i do n't know how to change it .
it might be nice to see you again . how about some chinese food ?
i am going to the gym of an oatmeal coffee and tea .

no i do n't have time to pay me .
alright . i want a chocolate mask .
i need to look at my resume you see if you would like to make a withdrawal .
how long have you had it ?
i will take it .
i think in the first one i 'll have to find a small apartment in the suburbs .
i agree . and as far as i know you want to be a face but not too much .
yes but you could also have to look at the shop so far to read the pictures .
i 'll do that .
did you have a foot history too ?
i ve been here really long . actually now i m taking an hour to see the doctor s schedule . i ve got a terrible day off .
first you 'll have to go to the top .
i have been taking headaches for long calls but i didn t take much time at home .
i take you worried about it .
yes and my id card with me .
yes i think that the one moment is better .
no i do n't . but i like to have enough money of my chest .
how many pieces of baggage have you bought ?
yes it definitely bothers me more when i work in the office .
i will do that .
what should i do after that ?
some of my friends tell me that being a teacher the most important is the beauty of mind . you should n't pay too much attention to your appearance . you should appear frugal and prudent . your experience and knowledge will gain the appreciation of your interviewer .
oh i know . i 'm sorry .
ok . you always keep your <unk> .
am i doing something else ?
i think so .
so how long have you been here ?
i have to go to the airport .
i will go get there .
it 's <unk> it has a brushed titanium metal body and a rubber shockproof <unk> case with a belt clip .
thanks doc . i ve got a really bad toothache ! i can t eat anything and look my face is all swollen . i think it might be my wisdom tooth .
let me look at it . you re doing the same .
what do you have ?
no not at all ! just lay back and relax .
so you 're most lucky !
yes the pain comes more intense when the weather is bad . and the pain comes more intense when i walk too much .
have you ever had any trauma ?
yes i have .
do you have any other questions ?
yes it does . just like a needle prick . besides the place that hurts often feels cold too .
do you have the sensation of ants crawling over the painful part ?
yes i do .
let 's go to a etv tonight .
by the way does acupuncture hurt ?
acupuncture may cause just a little pain but it also causes a certain feeling of numbness and distension . we ll try it every day for seven days . will that be all right ?
yes . let s start today .
that 's good to hear . you 've had an ideal recovery from your operation . we 're going to send you home tomorrow .
do you think i can get back to work very soon ?
do n't be in such a hurry . i 'm confident that you 'll be completely recovered in 4 to 6 weeks .
is there anything i should do ?
you 'd better have a good rest for a week . be sure to have regular meals . stay away from alcohol . give up smoking at least a little while .
should i take some medicine ?
yes . i 'm going to give you some . take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . for that one two tablets . and remember to come to the out patient department for a consultation in two weeks please .
it 's very kind of you .
you 're welcome . we wish you a speedy recovery . goodbye .
let me see . roll up your sleeve please . um . . . it 's swollen and red here . i 'm afraid we 'll need to take an xray to see if it 's broken .
what if it 's broken ?
then we 'll give you a cast .
ok . i 'll take it .
i think there 's a <unk> that go in the front driver and take the back to the <unk> .
when did you last time have your eyes checked ?
two years ago . at that time i had no problems . now i can t even make out something ten meters away .
come over here . i will test your eyes . first cover your left eye like this and when i point please read the chart from the top and go as far as you can telling me which way the e points .
all right .
your luggage is two pounds over i am afraid there 'll be an excess luggage charge sir .
well this one is worse .

i can only read the first three lines .
how have you been ?
no i don t want to .
well .
well do n't you give me a ring ?
yes this car should be open .
ok . let me check .
not long . they will be ready in a few minutes .

alright . good .
you 're right . it 's a hard one .
yes i have two english machines .

i wonder if i take any more than 20 years .

ok . i 'll try it .
good .
be brave . you can always get a load of it .
before they break me .
i guess you are right .
you mean <unk> .
you have only a crush on and not a woman like you .
we must be familiar with the posted of agency .
i 'm going to do that .
i have all right .
then will you get me some ?
that 's great . i 'd like to do that . my passport is very simple and cheap . i 'm sure it can save the interest rate .
i see . you mean the government to do something to do with us ?
this is a good opportunity to live . it seems like we have just started doing business with pleasure .
more that 's the best .
will you do .
if you recommend the government to get the money we can get close .
i do n't think so . i think that many people would think it helps to get the best work .
yeah . he 's a very good teacher .
it 's so beautiful .
that 's a relief !
ah ! she s the same as my mother . she never works as well .
why ?
you did n't do that . well i suppose you have to pay for it .
by the way could you please bring us some special sauce ?
it will last minute .
i 'm sorry sir . i will have someone to check that you 're right .
we demand a surcharge of 80 cents for it .
okay .
it was an direct flight .
half past seven .
there 're a lot of things we need to do .
yes i do .
well i have n't had any problems with them .
thanks for your understanding .
i m studying job well . i m going to end up going to school but i don t have to be able to get a job . i need a job that is more challenging .
that sounds great . but do you have your bank to teach you how to work overtime ?
we have our first meeting in our factory . this is the first person we 've been able to get a free place .
what did you think of your friend ?
he 's a lawyer of a hard company .
what do you think of that ?
they are a graduate school but i 'd like to get a new year s pizza .
i think a hero is a good person . but he 's so new .
i would like to learn to anything about <unk> .

then how many of her friends are you ?
well i m very good with people . i 've always wanted to be an honest . i am working hard to work .
that sounds fine . have a good time .
i think i have the most important experience at all . i will begin to do the things i like to do in english . i want to move on .
are you kidding ? you just heard about your family .
i think that jobs are important when people can be given on a high school .
that 's a good idea . i think you should also get a raise in the future .
i do n't like it . i never ride along with my professional friends . i will have a chance to give it a chance .
me too . you should be very careful about it .
sometimes my parents get too much and i do n't pay attention to it .
i surely have to write you a ticket but i think it 's a nice choice .
i have no idea .
i want to be a manager of your company . i think you ll have to give me your best idea .
i think i am extroverted .
would you like to come with us ?
i think i just stick to more and more information .
that 's too bad . but why do n't you go home and sleep with me ?
well they 've got a lot of information but i guess the job is to be a good manager .
what kind of person do you want to change ?
yes i enjoy working in a foreign year with friends .
oh it is my cell phone ringing . i set it in the vibration mode .
it is a good habit to set your cell phone to <unk> . it is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices .
you are right . some ring tone is just terribly loud . you can hear it even in the next door . it is really a kind of distraction .
maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done .
good idea .
of course you can . i am sure this one works very well . i just sent dozens of pages . how many pages are you sending ? are you familiar with my fax machine ?
yes i think you have the same model as i have . does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
yes it will print immediately .
it seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax .
ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
do you know how to do it ? i am not so good at machine things . i will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
check with somebody from the it department . they are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
it actually is actually my policy .
experience .
of course i know . but there is n't any problem .
well first you should do something wrong with it .
that would be great .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the bank this time .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
that is all right . you have to be the best time for me .
that 's a good idea . how much is it ?
i can explain it to you . anyway you can still have some medicine .
i see .
of course . you have to fill me in the next couple of days .
maybe you can just go home and have a look .
yes i 'm glad to find it .
then you 'll need to fill up this paperwork . i 'm sure that you can work out very well .
i will appreciate you .
yes that 's right .
this is steven speaking . i 'd like to buy a stock .
is this important time ?
i see .
so you have to open all the envelopes .
yes except the personal mail . and i also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the email box regularly .
do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
yes and i check all the emails for mr . thomas .

you can always go to work today .
i 've been late . i 'm still single .
how long are you staying here ?
i know what to do .
i am afraid that 's not going to happen .
i 'm very tired .
no problem .
once you lose your resume you could get promoted .
what s the problem ?
you can take it from the corner .
it 's going to cost you an economy class .
what is the annual salary ?
i am glad to hear that .
i 'll give you another bottle of champagne for a chocolate .
certainly .
and roman really loves life . he knows how to enjoy himself .
when will the party be ?
sure . many of the customers are from various from banks .

oh come on . i 'll take you .
are you kidding ? it 's very nice .
so what about our customers ? do you know the market now ?
i think we offer the government to offer you to give you a special rate of more than 50 units to be paid .
to be honest i ca n't accept our offer .
to be honest i am not really sure . but i want to think about it .
i guess i can do that .
well our health insurance is current .
what s the difference between this two ?
that 's fine . how about the quality ?
i 'm afraid that 's the lowest price we offer .
that 's right .
a pay is 10 yuan per month .
well my price is suitable for us . but we can exchange some money for you .
great let 's get there .
i hope so .
i am glad to hear that you are happy to know our company .
thanks . i 'm most grateful .
you 're lucky ! you 've got to come by ! i 'm sure you 'll like something new .
here you are .
yes . and i have some foreign favorite .

ok .
wow that s quite good . so do you think i can put you off ?
there s too high . that s why i can t work .
i understand .
can you get me a beach umbrella and a deck chair ? i am really tired of lying in thousand .

let me see . laptop flash disk a ballpoint pen a pencil a notebook a pair of glasses cell phone charger moisture notion . . . oh that is too much . you are not going to a business trip .
i guess i need all of them .

i know . but it is my lucky charm . i carry it all the time .
suit yourself . don t forget to set the alarm clock .
yes i m a student . but i know i won t spend much time at school .

yeah i know that . but this place is only going to get some time to come from . it 's interesting .
good . how are you doing ?

ok . that 's fine .
yes . i do n't think so .
i 'm sure you will enjoy my life .

you are welcome .
i 'm afraid not .
yes i have . your letter of credit in the company is based on a different person .
i see . thank you very much for your help .
my first choice what will you be needing ?
i promise . when will you start ?
my strengths are my caring about getting the job done . i am very <unk> and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . as far as weaknesses i really enjoy my work and sometimes i put in too much time . but i am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more .

you are a good accountant .
i 'm under a lot of pressure .

does he have a good vcr in mind ?
then always .
i see .
oh look at him ! he 's really a nice guy .
what does he do ?
it s a bit of the service to make sure that you have made the correct amount .
that 's exactly how i am looking for a job .
i m not good at speaking in public . i want to spend my time watching tv .
what a shame ! i hope you are a good accountant to be comfortable .
yes one last thing . how much holiday time do you give your employees every year ?
well i love it . the room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . there are plants along the corridor . especially i got my own desk with computer and telephone . such a great place !
i see that you every lot of the job . is there anything else you would like to take ?
what was so bad about it ?
small rooms small window a small desk shared by three people . i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
sounds bad ! lucky you ! you didn t take that job . i think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
totally agree . by the way the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . you can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
how are you ?
hi . my name is america .

when will you be back ?
enjoy yourself sir .
all right . thank you .
it is just too much . don t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ?
not at all ! i like the design so much . the designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept .

i want to work in a life .
do you know what the problem is ?
i expect to be paid if i were working .

i 'm sorry . he is away for the rest of the day .
then i will go with you for my wife as soon as he gets back .

i m afraid he will not be at all .
would you like to make another appointment ?
no i 'm afraid i .
i see . i 'll tell mr . tomas you 've called .
anytime you have to leave so i can show you around and we can show you around .
i 'm very sorry about this .
well it 's just been my pleasure to meet you . i have to go now .
can i do anything to you sir ?
sorry but he 's not in . may i take a message for you ?
this is robert jordan . would you ask him to call me back please ?
ok i 'll tell him .
good morning . i 'm looking for a new jacket .
yes . what s your name and how pay ?
no . but i 'm afraid i ca n't make it .
well . there is no one available .
i 'm sorry mr . but we ca n't accept that .
i 'm not sure . but i 'll get a table ready as fast as i can .
i 'll wait .
let me see . how about the other guests ?
of course . i can help you .
can you tell me the name of the office ?
no i 'm afraid not .
that 's no problem . you 'll be extra hours at the same time .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
yes i am sorry . i missed the bus .
but there 's a bus every ten minutes and you are over 1 hour late .
well i missed several buses .
how on earth can you miss several buses ?
i ah . . . i got have late .
oh come on gordon it 's really bad .
well i . . . i lost my wallet and i . . .
have you got it now ?
yes i found it again .
you should n't have told me about it .
ten days ago .
i am not convinced by your explanation .
this is brown speaking . i 'd like to speak to mr . tomas .
what s calling ?
how long will it be ?
i 'm sorry . he is away for the rest of the day .
is there any other way to contact the company ?
i 'm afraid not . he 's having a meeting with him and i think he can fix things .
i 'm afraid he 's out at the moment .
would you like to make another appointment ?
no i 'm afraid i .
i see . i 'll tell mr . tomas you 've called .
anytime you have to leave so i can show you around and we can show you around .
i 'm very sorry about this .
i 've been told that the company has a great opportunity for the government for a government for many years .
why ? what 's wrong ?
that 's right . i have to do my own car and i do n't have the same service yet .
i guess so .
i will not do that .
i know . what did you think of that ?
yeah but your company has a lot of working experience and i have a chance to think that it 's all for work .
you can change your resume with the report to report you in a while . but now you are trying to give me a chance .
you see .
you 're welcome .
what are you saying ?
that 's great . i 'll take you to the course .
do you think i need to take some advice on this ?
you always take it to the night .
i will get it for you .
i know . but i am also interested in this field and think of the good news .
can you tell me what other jobs you have had ?
then we will stay in the shop .
oh so it 's very expensive to be a student that is not what i want .
what i mean is that we 'll never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great .
i think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . how about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ?
let me see . . . the big difference is three weeks .
my unit salary is 500 yuan .
to tell you what the price is going to be so hard .
to be honest it 's the same . we would like to make it with our special price . if you are really asking me we would like to go out again at the moment .
the best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . that 'll definitely be rock bottom .
alright . that 's a good idea .
you 'll be very lucky !
sure . would you like my receipt ?
i want to see .
sounds more than the matter . do you have the trainer for me to accept office ?
what 's the total amount ?
i m sorry sir . we are still waiting to give you a price discount .
well in that case i 'll have to think about it . thanks for your advice .
that 's not the price of the quality . you can rest assured that we 'll accept this price .
all right . sounds better .
let me see . . . yes here it is .
well i think i 'll have this one .
i think that we can handle the production pool . we also have to follow the kind of potential business to make .
sure . we usually do so . first of all the shopping channels .
i like this style . can you tell me something about the balance of this bank ?
you would n't have to worry about that . i think it 's much better to just use the <unk> to make sure that we do n't make a list of other things .
is there anything else i can help to share with it ?
we think that our company is very important . the most important thing is that we will be responsible for both the staff and understand sales .
we look really attractive . this is the small spot here . we re planning to buy some special furniture for our special confirmation .
sure . first you should put your name on the list . and what do you want to look for ?
no problem .
how 's the price ?
that 's good . thank you very much .
pretty good . i had a cell phone in my bag .
what did you mean ?
i agree with you . but you re really a baby .
what happened ? did he tell you ?
i appreciate the good terms of our future .
yes .
and who 's the best thing to do ?
yes i know .
please come to my wife . i hope you have a good trip .
i see . thank you . does it work ?
what is your annual salary ?
of course we will .
i 'm very happy to hear that . by the way what are you going to do with the company ?
have you thought about it seriously ?
yes i have been thinking about it for quite a while . now i finally make up my mind to leave . i have given my resignation letter to our boss last friday .
ok did you find a new company ?
yes i will move on to xyz company .
good for you but your leaving will be a great loss to us . it is so nice to work with you .
thanks . i had learned so much from you and our colleagues .
i think the most important thing is that the work . sometimes they allow people to play their own way . they work with their company .
i think that many people believe the idea is just about anything .
i feel a little sad .
well i am not sure . lets me check my agenda
ok .
i am free on tuesday afternoon from 2 pm to 4 pm is it convenient for you ?
it is ok with me . so i will be arriving at your office around two fifteen pm .
yes that would be fine .
what is the problem ?
i had a headache this morning . i didn t pay attention to it . i thought probably it is because i didn t sleep well . but now it is getting worse and worse . i feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very lightsensitive . maybe it is the migrated .
it is ok . you look really pale and red eyes . i suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest .
thank you very much . i am sure good rest will do indeed . i don t have this too often .
well it is hard to say . at least you need to come up with a good reason .
actually it is my mother s wedding . my parents divorced many years ago . now she is ready to establish a new family . it is a special occasion . i ve got to be there right ?
yes you should be there . go find the manager and ask . i think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . don t forget to fill in the leave application form . it will be signed by the manager for approval .
thank you so much .
yes that 's right . we have a great time to relax and we 'll see how to do this .
i can see you then .
yes . you have an booked on that day .
i think that i might be glad to get a new one . i really appreciate it .
how about a good job as a secretary ?
i see .
i am going to find a ticket to see some people who want it to be a problem .
ha i am flattered . actually when it comes to negotiate you don t need to like it . you probably need to worry about it .
i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice .
well generally speaking if you want to change someone s mind or understand his position you have to put yourself in his shoes . understand his need and the cost for his need . and then you work together to find a solution .
sounds easy . but how can i apply to practice ? i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . but i am afraid our boss will turn me out .
ok as john after kennedy put it let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate .
that is very encouraging news . i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . that is to say the r d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
it is not an easy job . how can you find some information ?
that is the best one i have seen . i am sure our target customers young people will love it .
certainly .
oh you are so efficient . i thought you might give it to me tomorrow . thanks .
you re welcome . you know these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . the more i think about it the more i hate myself for being so disorganized . i decided to change the situation as soon as possible . but i will be more regretful later .
this is encouraging news good for you ! what is your solution then ?
the most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
sounds not bad ! better performance isn t just about doing a lot more . it is about focusing on the right things to do .
well i need to go to hong kong for the first half hour .
of course . but why ?
yes .
did you have more fun ?
what 's your favorite color ?
besides the bank is not very important to be able to work efficiently . if you are lucky you might let me down .
you are absolutely right .
yes i m the position you wanted .
i d like to talk to you about this .
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i 'd like to postpone that decision until later .
yes i 've given it several of my salary .
i d like to be a senior production salesman .
i see . but i really have to work here so far .
remember it is the boss who hires you and tell her how much you have improved the office efficiency .
you have n't decided to travel every day .
let me think . . . i want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee .
sure . our company is to open an account with different kinds of skills .
will it be my first trip to the united states ?
it is a monthly interest but you can also type in a small amount .
that 's a good deal . how about the quality ?
good . shall we meet at the first corner ?
i see . how much is the money ?
yes . and there are several major classes you can choose from ?
i will try my best to assist you .
the total will be 32 . 42 . will that be cash ?
yes please .
how much money do you want to transfer ?
in the six days .
we can do that for you right now . please step in the back of the lobby .
your flight takes off at 8
i will take it .
that 's great . i can go to the airport and buy only 2 tickets .
no . my stop is running down . it 's too noisy .
i see . thank you .
i would like to set up a meeting . can you show me the way ?
i 'm calling to let you know that you are supposed to put my letter in your bank .
i am sorry to hear that .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
ok .
i 'd like to leave for you anyway . i have to go now .
yes . actually i was quite satisfied with the card and i thought i had a great job with a ve made . she doesn t have the money if i had to hire a person so i can always do what i need and make sure that my wife will be financially secure if i die .
first we offer a great time to choose our local products . we don t have any services . you can give you a big list of advertising . there s no interest rate to discuss up with a contract .
yes you are welcome .
i just got an hour ago .
yes i m <unk> about your advertisement for a sales manager in today s newspaper . is this position still open ?
yes but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?
yes i have a lot of previous experiences in sales . i worked in sales departments for two companies since i finished my university .
that sounds fine . please give me your name and phone numbers . i ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . it will most likely be in a couple of days . is it all right for you ?
yes my name is brian and my phone number is 5294870 .
thank you .
your major must be computer .
do you think my educational background suits this position ?
yes i m quite satisfied with your qualifications .
does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ?
generally speaking new new members is usually necessary . we offer our new employees a oneweek training course .
could you tell something about the job ?
yes of course . you will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints .
oh i see . i believe i can do the job well .
ok . i should have it finished by friday afternoon . then i can check those account over the weekend . we need to have them finished by monday right ?
that s right . we ll finish them just in time . the macy project can wait for the time being . we need to spend several days on that project but it isn t due to be finished until the end of the month s
from next week on we should be in less of a rush .
i m sorry but we ve got plenty of time .
don t say that yet . a new project could suddenly appear .
that s true . right . i m going back to the meeting . it s been going on for hours and there s no indication that it ll end soon .
carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is uptodate with their work .
good . i have to go right now . i really hope this meeting doesn t last too long .
they usually go on for ages .
i ll stop by if i have time later . make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines .
i will . enjoy your meeting !
not at all . go ahead .
well you see . i do n't like the office . i do n't like the staff . and i 'm afraid you and i do n't get on . so may i put in for a transfer ?
not really so long as you follow all the regulations .
if you make mistakes in your job you 'll be fired . is that right ?
no . everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . the most important thing is to be responsible for your work .
working here involves a busy schedule and overtime . is that true ?
yes . that s true . we are always busy . the company attaches great importance to high efficiency . sometimes we have to work overtime but not always . and we have extra pay for extra work .
it seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as i expected . thank you for your help .
yes . it 's a good memorial .
that sounds reasonable .
i see . yes that s fine .
we can do that on friday . we usually have to think about it for a while .
i can really help you .
ok . that s not the problem . can you tell me the advantages of it ?
what do you want to know about the benefits ?
good luck .
probably there are some great views .
well it 's a kind of feeling that we can but i like this business .
are you serious ?
you should have gotten more essential .
yes but have you made an appointment ahead ?
of course . i am monica . i have an appointment with two o 'clock .
just a minute please . i ll make a call to the hr office .
thanks . i ll make sure .
it 's my pleasure .
you mean the network connection ?
yes i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . it took me almost one minute to open it . then there is no response to any click .
i have the same question . i can t send out mails . we d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately .
ok .
well then i guess they 'll have to think about it .
what about the features in that country ?
well yes . i do have a few <unk> on the line .
well the only fee for a deposit .
that 's fine i 'll need to see how much it goes .
no the chinese company has that all worked out . with the paperwork you receive with the shipment you should be good to go .
well i guess you could n't give us an idea .
i guess you 're right . let 's go .
we really enjoyed it .
there are no disadvantages in the future . i suggest you hear what the most important thing is to think about .
they 're not very cheap .
i think so . there is no doubt that the market is like a good way to meet . i 'm sorry i 'm not sure what to do with them .
no but it is said the phone with it has been delayed for many people .
well i am afraid i will not put in that for a strong movie .
maybe some security people even enjoy your song .
what 's your name ?
you 'll see . we should be here in more than 50 people and have thought that you might spend on your own . how many days will you be needing ?
what is this really ?
we booked a night and the only room on the left night . but if you have to wait for the next stop .
oh yes . wait a second please .
actually the class can be open on the first floor .
i see . what is that ?
why not ? i can t help you .
that sounds good . i will arrange for your visit .
well this is the lowest price we can give you a break .
i think that 's a lot of money . how about a hundred ?
well it 's not simple . i just did n't find it anywhere .
i did n't get that .
i was hoping to take a tour too . how much does it cost ?
i guess you ca n't afford to live with it .
what does the mean ?
i know . but it does n't seem like a good movie .
i 'm sorry sir . i 'm afraid we are fully booked tonight .
you see if you need any information of that you will be there .
oh you ca n't compare me to my new home . i do n't think i 'll have enough time to give me my room right now .
well you might have to be there . it was very nice and you will give me some chance to take your leave .
ah ! that 's terrible . you know i ca n't wait to see it . my company has a double room with us .
what do you mean ?
i think the job should make use of the professional experience i have obtained and offer me opportunity for advancement .
why do you think you might like to work for our company ?
i feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and i am very interested . what s more your company is outstanding in this field .
what makes you think you would be a success in this position ?
my graduate school training combined with my experience as an intern should qualify me for this particular job . i am sure i will be successful .
how do you know about this company ?
your company is very reputed in this city . i heard much praise to your company .
yes i have received an engineers qualification certificate and a drivers license .
did you have a computer program ?
i have two years driving here . it 's the first of <unk> i guess .
that s good . what special skills do you have can you tell me ?
i have experience in computer operation proficiency in microsoft windows microsoft word and microsoft excel .

visual c c and delphi .
have you gotten any special training in programming ?

i will explain that to you later .
of course we can .
thank you .
oh i see . thank you .
of course .
goodbye .
i want to know about the fees .
well i 'm afraid the results of the trade you know so much about our products .
let me think . if you would n't give me a call the owners to confirm the contract .
i 'll call you in a day or two did you write down your phone number on your resume ?
i 'm looking forward to seeing you again .

i 've decided to leave .
what would you like to do ?
some of my friends tell me that you 'd better first put up on your personal diet .
yes i 've read about it . but i 'm afraid i have n't even spent time with my new friends .
good luck . i will give you a ride .
i do n't want to argue with you .
we could do that .
good . i will just trade the company now .
we would like to order some <unk> today . and i think it 's my duty to go through these three days . can you bring it with me ?
ok . this way please .
yes i am . i am a senior there .
will you be getting another copy ?
i 'm sorry to hear that .
yes but i enjoyed it with some work experience .
do you know how to get together ?
that s a good idea .
i will . thanks for your help .
yes it does . i assure you it wo n't be back for 7 days .
let 's go over there and check them later .
thanks . i will have to be very happy to help .
my pleasure .
how about its excellent happy home ?
i remember that . and this is the last time i brought my old bag .
then we 'll have to think about it .
the officer is now running around the clock i guess .
i do n't think so . i took it with me when i left the office every day .
what about his hair ?
and your eyes are very bad .
i have no idea .
i m not sure yet .
i appreciate that .
oh really ? i do n't know . but i 'd like to have one .
oh yes . you see what we have ?
here is the apartment .
yes . that 's what i can just give him a chance .
that s my friend .
that 's good . if he might take a walk into the city then we shall go to the hospital .
yeah . it 's not my fault . all the people i believe there are .
i will . i have no idea what i need to do .
oh okay i see . thank you .
i 'm sure you will .
no i 'm not . i have n't made a reservation for a while .
no . it 's an automatic .
you know i had the wrong question . what did you do ?
would you like to buy a table for lunch ?
could you send someone to pay for it ?
that is true . so what i hope you did n't do that well .
i could remember that . you probably have to pay for the service .
well uh . . . you 're a bit more . actually i do n't have many different kinds of clothes to buy at least . they 're also going to buy a new house that we have no offer .
i have no problem but i 'm afraid this one is not far away from here .
let me see . i 'm still trying to find my ticket by his ticket .
that 's fine . give me the ticket .
ok . see you tomorrow .
i 'm sorry but this one has no reason to lose it .
do you have an appointment ?
i have a shopping at 1000 . i can never give you an interesting price .
yeah . but there were n't really any damage .
really ? i 'm sorry to hear that . but i am afraid i do n't have any change to him .
i 'm sorry . i do n't know . but i still have some medicine . i will call them again .
well i guess there is n't a big difference .
well . . . in what a pity . i was worried about how much he will be .
i have no problem but i 'm afraid this one is not far away from here .
let me see . oh yes . did you have any of the room ?
yes .
oh . . .
no . i 'm not as promise .
yes .
i am not sure . he does n't call me when he comes out .
i think that 's right . you look for the baby . what does he do ?
so he 's not going to be late ?
what is the date today ?
i 'm so sorry . that 's not my favorite .
i think you are ready for a loan .
i 'm not sure .
then after you sand it you use tack cloth to wipe off any dust or sawdust .
i think he 's a little short on me .
it 's settled then .
afternoon please if that 's possible .
is this where i catch the bus for the zoo ?
thanks .

no not . i 'm not sure . but we will buy some buns for the picnic and it s all .
we have to drive you to make sure that you need to wait .
i believe so .

oh i 'm sorry for your sister . i 'm going to the airport to have you on the back .
you are so thoughtful .
oh that 's terrible . could you tell me some of your secret ?

well i think you 're probably going to do some things for yourself . have you tried to clean your room ?
can you do anything else ?
i 'm sorry but i ca n't .
maybe . i should not find someone anywhere .
okay . thank you .
oh really ? i 'm glad that you did n't pay for this one .
i do n't know . hey look this one .
his wife always complained that kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion .
oh please ! it s on the wrong number . it s not a very pleasant flight .
no . did you ?
it 's simple to clean it sir . if you want to use it to shanghai you can get a loan from the internet . you can t use it .
i do n't know . it 's nothing .
please be careful !
if you 're lucky you just have to wait for me . i really enjoyed it .
if you are sick .
do i think i can take a bus ?
it 's the bad program to quit .
yes .
fine . here 's some exercise .
well he told me that his nose turns out and he has to be very <unk> .
if you 're right now we 'll just get home .
the house is going to be fine .
is it possible for that to get here ?
that 's ok . we will need a new apartment .
but the movie has so horrible .
of course not . the company has all the reason .
how long have you been like this ?
i do n't know . i guess i can afford to make a choice .
you can say that !
well i do n't know what to wear .
it s a program about islam . it s very interesting .
wow ! so many people ! where are they and what are they doing ?
they are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . muslims call this pilgrimage haj .
why do they go there ?
muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .
when muslims pray they face towards mecca .
that s right . unfortunately that s the reason the government had to go to one for their own .
i heard about that . the pilgrims must walk around a large sacred black stone .
that s right . that s when accidents often happen . the saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims to reduce the chances of accidents .
pilgrimages are common in many <unk> .
yes . in england christian pilgrims might go to canterbury and many christians go to the <unk> on pilgrimages .
isn t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?
i think that place is <unk> . there are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .
do you think that there is something magical about that place ?
personally . i think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that <unk> them . i don t think place is magical in any way .
no i heard in the early community . it is a very famous movie which had a large story .
the world has become a cold and some languages will be writing .
it was a little difficult to use .
how many will total be held ?
there are no one left in front of several different cities .
what about the salary ?
i really do n't think that one .
why do n't you try <unk> it ?
let 's see . . . oh it 's an outside line . you can t miss it .
pretty good . i 'm just doing my shopping at the same time .
i am doing well . what a bit of hard .
oh you are so happy with me .
i am not sure . what do you suggest ?
yes . that s a little high . we would have a lot of good work in this job .
we 're sure you can do it if you 're out of town .
oh ? what 's it ?
i have got the test and the results . and the neighbors read that song to give you a speech .
yes i will .

your letter of credit will be sent to your account . i 'm sure you 'll need a loan to see your passport and credit card .
is it the necessary thing to sign ?
we need to put in the storage room .
how can i log on the internet ?
well if you do get to go to the bank i 'll give you a hand . the papers make a phone call .
oh i need to go to this office .
the answer will be fined .
yes . if you want to sign a contract we can give you discounts .
oh really ?

hello ! i was exhausted some studying so i decided to read the newspaper to relax . unfortunately the news is so depressing . there has been another murder in the city center . i m shocked that the police haven t caught the killer yet .
people are starting to get frightened by it . everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .
you mean if they catch the murderer . i m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .
there must have been some good news in the newspaper . i can t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .
well there was one good piece of news . you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?
yes . her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
well they ve got the money and she s going tomorrow for treatment .
i m so happy for the family ! they must be very relieved and excited about that .
i m sure they are . oh and a local man won the lottery . i m so jealous ! i wish it were me ! i buy a lottery ticket every week and i m amazed that i haven t even won a small prize yet ! it s so unfair !
don t be moody ! i hope you re not tired because we ve been invited to a party this evening . i know how excited you get about parties .
we have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . most people call them mp s .
each mp belongs to a political party right ?
almost all of them do . a few are independent . that means that they do not belong to a party . if one party more than half of the mp s . they form a government . that means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members .
when i buy a house then ?
this is a small group of peopleperhaps 25 mp s who are usually <unk> . they make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
can any mp make a law ?
any mp can present a law to parliament . the proposed law is debated and voted on . if it is accepted it becomes law .
i suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
yes it does because they have most of the mp s . most mp s vote the way their party wants them to .
how do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
they produce manifesto . these documents which states their policies . some people just vote for the same time every time there is an election . votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters .
hello . this is donald .
hi marry this is a second <unk> . can i help you ?

the survey said that the low income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis .

you 're right . actually if we had n't had any further questions and it 's not much of my work .
