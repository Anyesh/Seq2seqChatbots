that 's a good idea . let 's go in and get a drink .
my mom just wants everything to be perfect for us .
what happened ?
he 's such a handsome guy . i really appreciate it .
it 's my pleasure .
i know . but why do n't you try the new one on . it 's a bit brand new .
what kind of benefits are you looking for ?
yeah i got it ! it was just a shop but i did n't really have to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out .
i 'm sure you like it .
she would be 86 dollars .
you mean what we are going to do ?
that 's a good way to keep in mind .
so what are you interested in ?
yes mum . did you go ?
cool down harry ! what are you really mad about ? did you get ripped off ?
yes . last sunday i went to a nearby market . it was on <unk> fair . i chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot without even trying to strike a bargain . i paid one hundred and twenty . and just
that 's good . i think the proposal is too high . i 'm sure it will be worth it .
but do n't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?
of course that 's something really irritation . and the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . i recommend you to consult the price tags in the superb
no problem .
i know . i promise i will be back soon .
you are so right . we remain in the same boat .
you see because we are n't so hungry as we 'd like to eat .
no i have n't been to it long .
i go to bed at ten and get up at six .
that 's helpful for your health .
sure .
yes i 'm very good .
really ? does mary know that ?
what 's the matter ?
we 'll get to paris .
yes i remember . i am really sorry . i ll listen to your doctor .
no . i 'll do that .
who s calling please ?
sure . can you have her call me back on my cell phone number ?
thanks . you re welcome .
80 .
here you are .
all right . i 'll give you the next size up .
would you mind if i helped out in the kitchen instead ? i do enjoy cooking .
this is supposed to be your vacation we 'd like you to just relax .
cooking makes me feel relaxed . so what are we cooking ?
ok well we 're going to make a pan of lasagne a salad and some garlic bread . here 's the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?
yes i do . i need some bread .
that 's a good idea . can you set the oven to 200 degrees celsius ?
that 's a bit high for lasagne . i 'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there .
fine . i 'll just get out the casserole dish the <unk> the salad bowl and the baking sheet .
you know i could do this myself . why do n't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ?
i do n't think it 's broken .
well if it 's not broken then you need to learn how to vacuum better because it does n't look like you 've vacuumed for ages !
fine . i 'll go vacuum . let me know if you need any other help .
yes . do you want to go there to the bank together ?
will you let me know where to get off ?
yes but it s 12 a .
thank you very much .
actually you should come to the 1130 date as the departure time of the day .
thank you very much .
it 's a fortyfive minute to an hour ride .
thank you .
you are welcome .
of course . is the dinner still on ?
yes i am . i was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .
i really liked living in a dorm . it was very nice to meet you .
that 's what i thought you would do . listen i live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . it 's just down the street from all the bars . you probably do n't want to be walking around after dark .
it ca n't be that bad .
but it is ! take this morning for example . the subway was so packed this morning i got totally squished by about a hundred busy <unk> on the way to work .
really ? i never would have guessed . the criminals must only come out in the evenings because i 've never noticed anything strange when i 've been at your house in the daytime .
do me a favor and take a taxi . it 'd make me feel a lot better .
ok we will . how do you get around in the evenings ?
when i first moved in i walked everywhere . but within a week i had my purse stolen just a block away from the police station ! now i always take public transportation .
has anything else happened to you ?
yes . two at the tenth rows .
well we 'll be careful . thanks for letting me know .
i know . but i m sorry . it s too cold .
are there many accidents in the city every day ?
but you know things cannot always go as you expect .
what is the address ?
any rain ?
i think so . the rush is that i can t catch the bus .
but remind you there are some forbidden activities .
i 'm afraid i have n't got a chance to see a movie .
no . i 'm just coming . say it 's been a pleasure seeing you .
i am so familiar with those who work style i am interested in in in in watching and play games .
what 's your ah !
i 'm still not sure but i think i 'll get a child that i 'll give you a good deal .
that 's great . let 's take the temperature .
do n't worry . you should try to fix it for a while .
what 's that ?
well i am gaining weight these days and i have to watch my calories .
yes sir . where to ?
hello madam . where to ?
all right sir . will you have your name please ?
thank you .
i m sorry . it s not allowed .
alright . see you tomorrow .
well do n't worry . you can get off at the next stop and walk across the street from here .
ten . this is a good time .
you know i know . but i hate shopping more than anything else .
i know but we could get some exercise in and we could get some errands run too . windowshopping won t cost you anything .
what kind of errands do we need to run ?
you can get a loan from the bank . you know we are talking about the car for the inconvenience .
i 'll only go if we can stop at the to pick up something to drink for tonight .
that 's a good idea .
yeah . it seems that everyone is anxious to get to school on a business trip to visit the great wall .
i promise . we re only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven t had time for .
ok let s go then !
let 's hurry . i 'm starving !
i 'm not sure .
i need to pay my bills .
i 'm not sure if you want to enjoy them .
there was a car accident . it looks like a squashed coke can .
i should have known . . .
oh actually ! there is a lot of to do .
hmm . . . well i 'm sure you 'll be able to make it i 'll be able to fit you in . i hope you can stay in bed for a while .
it 's already 3 8 o 'clock .
fill it up . super unleaded .
would you like something to drink ?
no . that 's all .
here you are .
to go please .
what kind of food would you like ?
well all right . i 'll be back in a minute .
it 's on the service counter over there . please go to help yourself .
fine with me but no more chafing dish .
let 's go to the food stall . there 's a good one just around the corner .
i 'd love to try some snacks .

kebabs and roast squid .

help yourself .

i think it 's a very good thing i can do .

i would like to purchase it .
no thanks .

no i 'm not .
i 'd like to make a birthday party . would you like to try my best ?
ok . now how can i help you ?
hmm let me see . boil some water and then whisk two eggs .
do n't you like it ?
not bad . ok now take some meat and potatoes from the fridge .
how many potatoes do you need ?
three . and bring four bell peppers .
gotcha ok . here they are .
now wash them then dice the potatoes and bell peppers then slice the meat .
where is the peeler ?
right over here sir . do you wear ?
size 41 . i want something in dark flannel .
and what would you like to go with your steak ?
thank you . i think i 'll take this one and these pants as well . they 're presents for a friend and i want to get a bigger size .
i 'll go and tell her .
yes please .
no thanks . i 'm just looking .

if you bring them back with your receipt within seven days you 'll get a full refund . also if you need alterations to the pants just bring them in and we 'll do them for free .
sounds good .
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
charge . here 's my card .
ok . i 'll have him come up to get you .
you 're welcome .
well let 's try a size ten . he gets another pair and the customer tries a shoe on looks like a perfect fit .
not really . it pinches my toes .
i 'm sure they 'll be fine once you break them in .
i do n't know . . well i guess i 'll take them since you do n't seem to have anything better .
thank you ma 'am . it 's been a pleasure doing business with you .
yes . i 'd like to change some money please .

david hall 83 bridge street .
wait a minute please . i 'll check it out for you . here is your bill .
i m speaking french .
um . . . i 'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni olives and extra cheese .
ottawa street .

it is a red .

it 's a bit expensive . what about this one ?
i hope you are .
hi your school was a bit too far from here .
speaking .
ok are you checking out tomorrow ?
sure . here you are .
thanks .
because i m not in the mood that s why .
well don t just sit there do something . come and help me in the kitchen .
help you in the kitchen i don t feel like it .
would you like to clear the table then ?
yes do you have it in the office ?
not if you don t want to .
really it 's so beautiful .
yes .
you must n't pick it in this place .
i 'd like to .
not very far from here . we 'll fly . it 's about one and a half hours .
yes ?
could i have one more blanket ?
why not ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i 'm sorry .
it says no smoking .
sorry i 'm very near sighted .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do it again .
try to be more careful in future .
well i m afraid there isn t . it s nothing .
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you them .
i 'm not surprised . you eat too much .
and i suppose sitting at a desk all day at the office does n't help .
yes i think so .
i do wish i could lose weight .
well why do n't you go on a diet ?
i 've tried diets before but they 've never worked .
perhaps you should excercise more . why do n't you go to an exercise class .
yes maybe i should .
that is just an excuse . you can always find some time to exercise .
but i work hard all the time for long hours . often i have no time for lunch . yet i am still getting fatter .
bill you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . and skipping meals will not help you lose weight . in fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals .
i know you 're right but what can i do ?
i 'm a fashion designer . next month i have a fashion show . i d love it if come . i can get you a couple of tickets . so you can bring a friend if you like .
but i 'll miss the news . it s important in my business to keep up with events in china .
i know i know . have you got a portable radio ? you can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time .
that 's a good idea !
oh my god . it 's disaster . she s a <unk> brown color .
all right sir .
i would be happy to help !
potatoes .
the food is excellent .
ok . would you like anything else ?
what 's the matter ?
how did the business trip go ?
well i swim and run every day .
now tell me what do you eat ?
well i do n't eat any meat but i do eat fish and eggs .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
oh yes and fruit i love fruit .
what do you drink ?
well i never drink alcohol coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
what do you drink ?
you too . have you lost some weight ?
yes i took off 4 kilos . i am glad you notice it .
how did i do it ?
no no i just changed my eating habits . i eat a balance meal . and i eat less than before .
sounds great ! do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
and that 's what i was in the matter .
yes what 's up ?
this is bob . i mean he is our office .
okay . how much would it cost ?
that s ok .
no thanks . i have had enough .
actually you have n't have much .
to tell you the truth i am on the diet .
that sounds ridiculous . why ?
well i am gaining weight these days and i have to watch my calories .
no do n't try to tend me . i 'm becoming chubby and i have to slender down .
do you think you are fat and crazy ?
i do n't think so . i know i 've put on weight this winter .
so you are watching your weight are n't you ?
yes to tell you the truth . i am on the diet .
where are you heading now ?
i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road . it is very close to your house .
is that the university next to the teachers college ?
that 's the one .
you mean we 'll share the taxi ?
yeah . if we share the cab it 'll be cheaper . besides that your chinese is better than mine . the drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though i practice my pronunciation carefully .
well . do n't worry about it i will be happy to share the taxi with you .
take me to the airport please .
are you in a hurry ?
yes i have to be there before .
we 'll have a nurse take up here .
there 's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
i 'll do my best .
here 's twenty dollars .
it 's a little bit expensive . let me see if it 's possible .
no . if you ca n't break it keep the change . but can you give me a receipt ?
here is your receipt . thank you .
yes they all stop at this corner .
i want to go to broadway and 82nd street . can i take any bus that comes along ?
you can take any bus except the number 9 .
how often do the buses run ?
they run about every five minutes .
fine . how long does it take to get to 82nd street ?
about fifteen minutes . it 's not far . are you a stranger in new york ?
yes i am . i arrived only three days ago from japan .
how do you like new york city ?
i like it very much but it 's a little confusing to me .
you 'll soon get accustomed to it . it 's not difficult . well here 's the bus . fortunately it 's not full .
thank you for the information .
do n't mention it .
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
i saw her yesterday . she was a little better .
must i catch a number 7 bus to get there ?
no you need n't . a number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital .
number 13 buses run much more frequently do n't they ?
yes . i caught a number 7 bus yesterday and they said i had taken a wrong bus .
thank you henry . i 'll get a number 13 .
but number 13 buses leave from the center of town . you 'll have to walk two miles to catch one .
oh no . you should take the no . 14 tram .
where can i take it ?
two blocks down the street .
yes ?
could i have one more blanket ?
certainly . go along queen's road . . .
yes and turn right at the hilton hotel .
yes and turn right at the hilton hotel .
right at the hilton .
then go up garden road past the cathedral .
the cathedral ?
yes . then cross the road at the next traffic lights . the peak tram is straight ahead . you ca n't miss it .
that 's very kind of you . thank you . er . . . have you got a pencil ?
yes . why ?
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
oh it 's all yours .
thank you .
no you ca n't . it 's at the end of the street .
thank you .
yes . go straight ahead till you come to the traffic lights turn left there and it 's the first turning on the right .
straight ahead to the traffic lights left and then right .
that 's it . it 'll take you about five minutes .
thank you very much .
no nobody .
you don t mind if i smoke do you ?

i m worried about my daughter . she can t decide about college .

i don t mind that . but she disagrees with me about everything .
you should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . you shouldn t affect her decision .
but i just want to give her some tips .
oh she can make her own decisions .
i guess you are right .
believe me . everything will be ok .
i hope so .
but yesterday you said you would rent it .
i ve changed my mind .

yes . i ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . the demand for phone cameras is growing and pear has been falling behind in the market .
that s great ! i m glad to hear that pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . is pear still interested in having those ?

ok these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a twoinch heel so they are very comfortable .
i don t like the pointed toes . let me take a look at what else you have . too high . that one looks like the back would cut into my heel . i have a high instep so i doubt that one will fit properly . i don t want . i find very uncomfortable . those might as well be . too modern . too modern . those might as well be . those might as well be . those might as well be . those might as well
what size ?
size five .
do you have a seat preference for anything ?

why not ? come on ! just a cute little puppy or a kitty !

that s what i charge .

i live in london but i 'm not sure of the city .
okay mr . horn see you tomorrow at 1030 .
i was hoping to get into a home and put in a lot of paperwork .
i had a home inspection before but didn t really understand it .
if i will look at the owner s check and see what the problems are .
have you taken a slight fever ?
i will think about it .
i thought it was too expensive .
your offering price is not included . just check it with the shipping time .
a fax machine sounds like a copy of the supplies . i will check it out and see if the copy is available .
i found it in the ads and they gave me a lot of information .
right now i am busy . but you should be there in about half an hour .
i 'm afraid i have to be late for the night .
as soon as you bring your keys out we will be moving in .
i see .
that 's nice . i can go and pick some pictures of the old carpet .
i want to paint it for you right away .
that 's right . i just need to get it at the moment .
thanks . but i think i need to hire a few people who do that .
that would be great .
yes . which one is the brake again ?
the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas .
i m glad this car is an automatic . i do n't like having to change gears .
automatics are very simple to drive . the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver s seat !
very funny . next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . can you see out of them ?
i can t see anything out of the side of the car . could you move it forward a bit please ?
how s that ?
that s better . now what ?
check your petrol situation .
the tank is almost empty . i guess i ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up .
that s a good idea . put your keys in the ignition start it up put the car in reserve wait for the road to be clear and then back out of the .
i got it . don t worry . i ll get you there in one piece .
remember no honking this time . the horn is only for emergencies !
why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ?
i 'm not quitting yet . you know my favourite slogan do n't you ?
yeah i know . shop till you drop .
right !
i think you should give it a try .
ok .
what 's the matter ?
ahahah and i thought you were tired .
you know . i have a weakness for long dresses .
it sure looks special looks expensive too .
i don t think that is too much for rent .
yes i 'm afraid not .

eyes you sent them to new york right ?
that 's right . i thought i 'd come back to buy a few more souvenirs .
what did you have in mind ?

well shall we go to the cafeteria ? i 'd like to see if they have good menu .
and how long did you stay ?
they would n't be ready .

i 'm sorry but i have to go now .
i just want to see the problem .

how can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ?
i 'm afraid so . i could n't wait to see it .
you can always make a sandwich .
i honestly did n't know that .
yeah i agree . people are always gossiping about one another .
yeah it 's hard to believe but true .
but we 'd better take the bus .
does the bus go there ?
i really like that outfit .
i do wish i could lose weight .
yeah i think i 'm the right person who committed at the university of the company .
but the bus takes a long time . you could fly it 's not so expensive these days .
it only takes 45 minutes to an hour .
is that right ?
i do n't know .
it 's always nice to hear that anyway .
yeah sometimes i really need to take a bus .
hmm . . . well maybe i 'll buy a pair of shoes .

yes i do .
yes . i am . i can t afford it .

i 've never seen a lot of people lately .
are you really interested in doing something ?
no problem .
i do n't think so . i really want to buy a new one .
what kind of guarantee are you getting ?
i think so .
but there 's a bus every ten minutes and you are over 1 hour late .
it 's about fortyfive minutes to an hour .
oh does it really a long way to go .
we can get one from here .
it 's worth listening .
that 's right . they have a sale on this machine .
thanks . let 's go driving again tomorrow .
what kind of car do you like ?
we should take the no . 36 bus .
what ?
i messed up .
and i think i 'm going to have to pay the bill .
i think so .
what should we do ?
i honestly did n't know .
i should 've just stayed on the bus .
yes . and suddenly i heard someone call my name . i turned around and there was this man looking at me . i did n't recognize him at all but he obviously knew who i was .
do you think we 'll one day be able to catch another bus ?
which bus should i take then ?
yes it does .
ok . there is no cash advance anymore .
yeah . why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
oh good . why do n't you take the bus to mine and we 'll have to walk there ?
it 's about fifteen minutes .
what do the drivers speak english ?
you can take no . 2 bus here .
it 's better than driving .

i 'll be back there as soon as possible .
and all of the flowers are in bloom .

you wo n't be able to tell the difference with a magnifying glass .
. . . . okay i 'm through . here 's the form and my old card .
very good . you can pick up your order in one week .

oh i learned that book last week .
it was founded in 2002 has been in business for 10 years .
oh i learned that book last week .
yes and they simply want to have more and more time to find a place to live .
i see .
oh you must have thought of that .
i 'm afraid there is no one here to go . is there anything else i can do for you ?
they got their reason .
it sounds interesting . so it must be really amazing to get a higher grade .
next time you can get one from the counter over there . or before you come in you can download one from our website . it 's really easy .
exactly .
i do n't know .
what do you think of the literature course ?
yes it seems to be just about how much time flies . this year has been the latest design for the past year .
oh i didn t know that .
no we are just too different to be . you are an expert in it .
are there many things there ?
how do you like working in the office ?
that s what i need .
did you know that ?
not bad . i made the final .
how was your flight ?
no i do n't know whether i can pass or not .
what about a topic ?
english . i 've liked english ever since middle school and then in university i had some excellent teachers .
you are are are attracted to this evening .
no i did n't .
i will be back soon .
i do n't know . who ?
again ? i thought you must be in paris .
he 's a captain . are you sure he is a quick learner ?
i wish he could stay in love with each other and the host family .
that s it !
you are just a little bit . you need to learn how to control your temper .
i would n't count on it .
well it 's not all my fault . have you ever been there ?
you 're welcome . come back in a little while i 'm here to check out if you do n't need anything .
that 's interesting .
oh not too much . i heard you . i heard about the new product of putting in the newspaper .
what 's the matter ? are you ok ?
i do n't know . i just got sick and tired .
really ? that s great news . what time are you going ?
oh my god . i 've forgotten about it . i do n't want to get a chance .
as the saying goes work value work play value play . all work and no play make a boy you know .
ok . let me think about it .
i am leaving this afternoon . i 'll be here in about an hour .
what a shame ! now you have to prepare the next day .
i 'm going to put it in front of the window .
but i do n't know how to play basketball .
you are really lucky . that 's why i make a deposit .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
you did it . the water and material was so clean that they end up once .
maybe you are right . i 'll change it to a new job .
well . is this a promise ?
susan just one last week i went out to have a lunch with her . there are several details that are given on friday mornings and next week . just hope to be a place of our company will need for all of them .
well you are right . but i just love them . how can i do this ?
that 's great . we can go camping .
that s right . i m sure i ll like it .
what kind of college is it ?
nice to meet you lvan . my name is alike . i 'm from japan .
how do you do ?
a second language is always difficult .
true but english is harder than most . it s a crazy language .
a second language is always difficult .
one letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .
no wonder you say english is a crazy language .
i don t know if i told you or not but i decided to start my own business .
me too . did you go out for a drink too ?
i have a driver 's license and a membership visa .
does n't sound like a lot of english movies .
to be honest i like all of them except for the math teacher . though he must be quite young he seems like an old person . he 's so boring .
he is hopeless .
oh it 's ok . i got a lot of energy and i can speak it .
she must be very nervous and challenging .
she 's in the hospital with my dad .
i m glad to hear that .
of course i did . she s a nice girl .
she is a pretty good teacher !
yes i do .
that 's ok .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
what is that ? what are you going to do with you ? you ve got to lose weight ?
i understand . but you ll be sorry i could use this .
i hear we ll have a new english teacher this semester .
no but she did n't .
dad it 's raining outside .
i do n't think so .
it 's the most difficult to tell .
she was a very good employee and we wanted to keep her so her supervisor called her in for a chat .
no doubt . her husband is very smart .
i learned to be patient professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .
you can say that .
yes . can you give me some suggestions ?
i am glad that you think so . but what 's the most important thing for you to ask me ?
no but she refused to take the medicine .
that 's what i feel .
you think of making a clever way .
what s the matter with her ?
yes they have three kids and a big house . they have very good restaurants and ornaments but only do n't have enough money to worry about them .
i heard that too . she must have been getting rid of a few years .
she 'd be interested in a quiet place .
parents took me to the station ?
yes . i tried reading a lot of books about foreign language film but i played cards .
and she is also a lot of good news .
which model is the bestseller ?
you ca n't help learning when you 're using it all day . you ll see . a few weeks study in the school will have a similar effect on you .
i hope so . you see at the moment i find it difficult to get used to the teacher 's speed and accent . i 'm awfully worried i ca n't reply as quickly as she seems to expect .
oh she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use english throughout the class . she does n't mind your making mistakes though .
you know speaking in class is a very good chance to put your english to practical use .
that 's the new teacher .
what do you think of the teacher ?
she 's very nice .
what does she teach ?
english of course .
is she your teacher ?
yes . she teaches our class three times a week .
can she speak chinese to her students ?
not very much .
it 's a good thing you can speak english !
yes i finished last friday .
you sound relieved .
well yes . i do n't mind admitting that i am . i enjoyed school but i did object to having to go in every day once we 've done all our exams .
well what are you going to do now ? have you made any plans ?
yes i intend to go to university . that ll be in september . but it all depends on my a level results .
so you 're going to be able to attend the city of london ?
oh yes .
five days a week too ?
actually five and a half . on saturday we have classes only in the morning .
gosh !
that 's too much for us really .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to buy a new air conditioner for my parents . oh it s two o clock . i must go now .
when do you start school ?
i 'm going to register right now .
that 's good .
hi sterling !
what 's wrong ?
she 's very nice .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
both of them are not very complicated .
it seems that english already is the most important thing .
sometimes it 's a little complicated . but some schools do n't have so many money for them .
yes and sometimes the parents are too excited to believe that so .
oh i go to the private school .
i see . are there any other classes available ?
sometimes but in most of the schools in america the united states the university had difficulty finding a job .
do you know why your parents want to live there ?
i don t have any furniture so i use my computer . i find my money to be used to one of my country . i prefer to buy one .
there are hundreds and hundreds . english is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions .
can you give us an example ?
i 'll look up the rate . to look up does n't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . it means to search for and find some information .
what about the expression goodbye ? is that an idiom ?
that is just a natural grammatical english expression . it has a direct translation in other languages .
i am very sorry about that . but i can not attend the english course . it is n't too difficult for me to study i am very serious about learning chinese .
i need to see if we can get together today .
can i have a look at them please ?
i sure do .
ok just a moment please . here you are i need you to sign here please . and here is your refund . is there anything else i can help you with ?
i forgot about it .
yes . and suddenly i heard someone call my name . i turned around and there was this man looking at me . i did n't recognize him at all but he obviously knew who i was .
how long is the holiday ?
you will have to pay 25 cents in total .
how much is the fee ?
i ll just have to pay you back .
i really appreciate your help .
i need to use the internet .
is there a problem ?
i have it . here you go .
i have it right here .
because i m not going to be able to attend the university of michigan .
ok it 's a date then !

i have both but i usually use my car to get to school .
thank you . i will be coming down now .
i am not sure what a handicapped spot is .
you have to buy two soft drink cakes .
i am not sure what a handicapped spot is .
why do you have a look at the timetable ?
what signs ?
pay attention to what the signs tell you in terms of time limits and what days you can park there . do you know what the curb colors mean ?
i am not sure what the curb colors mean .
just remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means loading and unloading only . i think you 'll be good to go !
yes we are here to help you .
my office is kind of here . i 'll come back in about a week to make sure my stuff is up .
are you sure you 're finished ?
then what shall i do ?
ok could you please tell me what your backpack looks like ?
first of all you need to turn the gas in the ignition and start the car .
do you promise ?
ok . i am sorry . you must have been so busy .
which one interests you sir ?
what is the problem ?
it 's it has a brushed titanium metal body and a rubber shockproof <unk> case with a belt clip .
hmm . . . well what 's this ? is it your first time to be here ?
no i always have important business to take care of that morning .
oh what 's that ?
i will . thanks again .

i 'm leaving on sunday . we 're going to have a lot of fun .

thank you for saying so .
where did you go to university ?

yes . we must have .
oh ! i do n't know . but why do n't you take a message ?
i really do n't like it .
you love the stuff . he works in the kitchen . . .
yeah . he looks rather pale .
ok so so what ? i do n't know .
can you trust him ? maybe he will understand .
that 's good . do you live near here ?
what kind of food do you want ?
yes i see . i ca n't believe he has been so helpful .
me too .
yes . i m glad to meet him . i ve always likes playing with him .
you think it 's funny .
why ? are you sure you were wrong with your new job ?
yes it is . it 's not so cold today .
my wife will be back as soon as i get home from work .
i 'm afraid we 're going to ask the bus to come . we 'll just have to walk out .
yes i did .
what did you think of it ?
i thought it was better than the othersi really liked it . what did you think of it ?
but i think it was n't too bad .
oh i 'm not sure i agree with you . it was not a good one but it was not the worst one . actually it was n't too bad .
i ca n't think the same .
what 's more some scenes were good much fit for the children .
i could n't agree with you .
yes ?
it 's hard to say .
don t worry . i will help you later .
i 'm not sure . it could be the tires . let 's stop here .
what 's wrong with her .
no not at all . it was n't . i did n't know you had split up . what was wrong ?
of course i forgive you . what are friends for ? now what am i going to do for that other guy ?
do you think she will be able to work together ?
you 're welcome .
pretty good . i ve just had my new poems published .
congratulations on your success .
thank you .
what can i help you with ?
he is fine .
he s going to be sent to britain to study really ?
yes . he s already got the passport and visa .
fantastic ! please send him my congratulations .
thank you . he s very lucky indeed .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
what did you do ?
because i 'm not good at it .
i m thinking about it for a walk in the country .
you can say that the beauty of it for you .
to be honest i 've never really liked it .
that is true . i hope it does n't rain .
yes . you can find information on the internet .
i do n't know . it 's a distinctive <unk> .
i 'm sick of it too .
the door bell does n't work the sink is leaking there 's no hot water and the building is falling apart !
it 's no use complaining . if we had got enough money we could n't put up with it and would have moved out .
sure .
oh yes i m afraid i can t do that . i ve got a terrible toothache .
but you should avoid <unk> when you haven t got the real facts .
ok . i ll try my best to calm down first .
are you kidding me ?
it s all right .
i think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you .
i was in a comfortable place so really it s no problem . i was late getting up this morning and i forgot to put you in just a while .
yes . when i came out of the subway it was raining cats and dogs . and i forgot my umbrella . so i had to wait for the rain to let up .
i totally understand .
i had a fever with a bad headache .
poor girl !
not much except that my motherinlaw is driving me up the wall .
what 's the problem ?
i need help turning them on .
we have the equal partnership in team .
like for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
no i ca n't see that happening . i know you 're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
it 's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .
my motherinlaw used to do the same thing to us . if it was n't disciplining them enough then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them the schools we sent them the schools we sent them the schools we sent them too and everything else under the sun .
i 'm glad you 're right . we need to get to the bottom of what we 're doing . what 's the name of the meeting ?
she asked me if i hadn t got it .
that 's pretty bad . she 's given me the reason why she 's the manager 's office called and the office .
what 's the matter ?
it was a great idea to have a good time . it s really a lot of work .
yeah i 'll be glad to help you .
i can t believe i can t afford a house .
so nice of you .
can you give me a break ?
no way . i m really sorry .
yes i will .
when is it ?
i must have missed it .
when you hired me you knew i 'd be the first time i saw .
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
yes i agree with you . when you leave work as you can .
can you give me a receipt ?
ok . that 's what i want .
where would you say ?
i m sure you do miss that type of cooking . but can t you try to get used to western food ?
i have tried . but americans like butter bread sugar and cream too much .
i suppose you re right lee . maybe that s why so many westerners are overweight .
it s interesting that americans work very hard at their jobs do not take naps during the day and yet they can be so heavy .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too much fast food and that food is very fattening .
why don t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy being outside working during the day ?
what do you suggest ? i can t afford to quit my job until i get a new one .
maybe you have two choices . you could attend school during the day or you could get a position that provides training .
really it 's so beautiful .
yes .
you must n't pick it in this place .
i 'd like to .
not very far from here . we 'll fly . it 's about one and a half hours .
i 've never thought about that before .
yes i would like to check in . here are my ticket and baggage .
yes . and i recommend this book . it 's for three days and it 's for fifty cents .
i 'm not sure if i can but i 'll try .
he is so handsome . i 've seen him a lot of times .
i bought it yesterday afternoon .
what time does the next day be here ?
sure . here you are .
thank you . what 's your occupation mr . smith ?
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
and what did you do after that ?
i did too many people .
i 'd love to .
let s have a look . whoa ! get away from me !
you can t be serious .
i will think about it .
ok i 'm afraid it 's too noisy . i ca n't see why you did n't .
i will do my best .
i do n't know . i want to replace this one . it 's a wonderful one .
how fun ! can i bring something ?
i do n't know . well my contract here is for one year and i do n't know what i should do after that . maybe going around for a while .
well have you ever thought about learning some chinese ?
actually i am learning that now . but it 's too hard for me . you know the four tones and the stuff . it really <unk> me out .
do n't worry . all things are difficult before they are easy .
you hit the nail right on the head .
well are you invested in some program ?
what is it ?
well you know how i 've been working at the economist as a proofreader right ?
awesome . i 've been giving this a lot of thought . when can we do this ?
how about this sunday ?
yes sunday sounds fine . what time ?
good . i 'll give you a call tonight .
no problem .
i would like to order number 17 that for you .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
i am not in the mood .
why are you feeling depress ?
i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . that 's a real letdown .
i do n't think she would do such a thing .
but she did and it made me disappointed .
oh cheer up . a girlfriend is not everything .
but she means a lot to me .
then forgive her mistake .
oh . i just can t forget it .
do n't worry about that .
yes i do . i have an email to talk with them in a computer company .
well i 'm afraid it 's too hard to say .
i think that 's a good idea .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
yes i like it very much .
what 's so bad about it ?
oh sorry i forgot .
i 'll bet the bus is coming .
that 's all right .
where would you like to go ?
you 'll recover after a good night 's sleep .
that 's very sensible . maybe we can try it later .
i know . i think i 'll buy a new one and give me a break .
you can have a look at the little .
so you must be lonely ?
it must have been easy but i still have n't gone to the music class yet .
i do n't care it 's a bad movie .
i 'm afraid i 'm too busy .
what do you find it ?
yes thank you . but what do you do to my health club ?
i will make you as soon as possible .
well go to the beach anytime 's just like .
you can say that again . i just have to go back to school tomorrow .
yes i was . i forgot to put my jacket in the house .
that 's true .
thank you . i 'd like a glass of juice please .
thirteen yuan please .
no problem . we 'll try our best .
how would you like it ?
i am sorry too . i know we 've been talking about this beach trip for a while . i should have told bob i was busy this weekend .
do n't be silly . you guys should spend as much time together as you can . besides we can go to the beach anytime .
thanks for understanding .
that 's all right . make sure to look closely next time .
hey what if the three of us go to the beach together ? besides you and bob have n't seen each other for a while . i do n't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers .
nah i would n't worry about that . but i do n't want to be the third wheel . you two should have some quiet time to yourselves .
i know bob wo n't mind . i 've got a date already .
maybe . . . i 'll think about it .
well last night i had a big argument with ann .
terrible . it must be something serious . you two are such close friends .
now that i look back at it it it was n't that big a deal . i should n't have lost my temper .
really ? what happened ?
my neighbor hit my brother on the head . he s bleeding .
that 's pretty harsh .
i 'm sorry but i was so upset . i mean come on ! does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ?
you know she probably feels just as bad .
well i think i was being a little selfish myself . i know they do n't get to see each other very often .
well in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding . you should n't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . after all you can go to the beach anytime you want .
yeah i 'll call later to patch things up .
that 's very kind of you to say so . let 's try some <unk> wines .
great . sweet wines are my favorite . they always make a great finish to a decisions meal .
do you prefer brandy or ports .
port please .
excellent choice . i love its smooth flavor .
the port is quite exquisite . it must have spent years aging in barrels . am i right ?
yes . you always have a good nose for wines .
next time we are about to dinner we should try some canadian ice wine .
oh what 's that ?
well you know i have some students studying for their master 's degree . one of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
why not ? it sounds great .
ok here 's to your health .
thanks . cheers .
cheers .
well i 'm not sure . i need to pay my bill but i 'm running a bit of a rush .
i am going to check out tomorrow .
i 'm sorry . when does the flight depart ?
yes sir . we have your reservation . could you fill out these forms please ?
no i haven t had a girlfriend .
what number is your friend ?
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
that sounds interesting .
yes and i agree with all his policies .
so he is called to play in chess as a man of character .
he was very pleased with your fact .
that s right . he s done this before . i can make a decision . would you like to call him now ?
there was a introduce myself .
so what did you do ?
what did he do ?
what s wrong with it ?
i felt that the haven t been a major problems in my field . one of my coworkers is in the field . i want to make a decision of my career and i feel that they have accumulated enough experience . i m glad to take it .
looks like you re going to lose out on this game then .
i can t believe it ! i thought the cougars were going to win for sure .
what were the odds ?
20 to 1 in favour of the cougars !
too bad .
what is it ? what happened ?
i think someone is stalking me .
no it ca n't be . really ? who ?
i do n't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking but staring . he just kept staring at me . he did n't stop .
what did you do ?
i was responsible for helping patients restore their organic functions training them in speech and carrying our massage and taking care of patients nutrition and diet .
did he leave when you left ?
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .
what did you do ?
that 's about five blocks . and around corners too . so he was definitely following you .
yes he was . i 'm not imagining it . finally just when i got home i turned around and looked at him . he was just standing there . he did n't smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious . what should i do ? i 'm so scared . can i call the police ?
actually i do n't think you can call the police . not yet at least . he has n't done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it . but if anything happens again then maybe you should call .
why ca n't i call the police now ? he was definitely following me !
of course you can call the police if you want . that 's not what i mean . i 'm just saying that they probably wo n't do anything .
i suppose . what can they do ? i do n't even know who he is .
i do n't know . well who else will be the best man .
alright . and i wo n't go to that cafe for awhile .
more or less . there 's just one thing bothering me .
oh ? what 's that ?
well you know i have some students studying for their master 's degree . one of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
what kind of car are you going to buy ?
no thanks . i mean what 's the matter with it .
you refused the gift ? that 's terrible .
i know but i really ca n't accept such an expensive gift . i explained to him why but he seemed really upset about it . i think he might have taken it the wrong way .
perhaps . he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
that 's what i am worried about . i do understand the respect attached with the gift and i am honored . but i really do n't think it 's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . i think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
can you tell me how to get to the jade buddha temple ?
i would love for you to take a walk in the park .
i 'm sorry . there 's no need to call the security door .
i am sorry .
i see . why do you think that ?
no i do n't think we can . my family lives in the city are good .
please go to the front to have a look .
they did n't want to pick up the wood . they 're in the middle of the bathroom toilet .
i see . well i think that 's because they have taken enough money to update the house .
you 'd better give up your missed work today .
and how about your spanish ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
i see . if you 'll go to the medical department all over the world can you tell me how to get a refund ?
yes it is . think about it . if nobody paid any attention to anything then what 's it all for anyway ?
i see . the other two cars are for the same . also i think you should have a look .
oh i 'm sorry . you know we are going to get you a new one . i 'll buy you a new one .
well i guess i could eat some chocolate .
you 're really a good citizen .
well we ca n't just afford it . we should be in a short time .
i 've never heard of this before . i heard that the olympic games are very different from what i thought . why do you ask ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
so what do you mean ?
it was really a nightmare . then i tried to land the night and as i as the day was busy as i did .
i had a wonderful time .
you know sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . they may insist they are sick when they are not .
yes it 's true . is it a beauty ?
i think that 's the only thing i can do .
i see . thank you .
my birthday comes next month . i want to hold a birthday party too .
oh come on . the weekend is something different . i 've been thinking of doing the summer .
then i came back here . i worked for about three years to get some experience .
i guess we can still go window and enjoy the food .
yes . i hope we can make it .
yes .
i am leaving on november 10th .
i still love you .
it 's really nice .
if you have n't decided to leave the company yet let me know .
of course . i always keep what i catch .
my holiday is only six weeks but i think my brother and his family would take it for the other two weeks . is the house in good condition ?
how much do you want to spend ?
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
what happened ?
would you like a shave ?
no thanks . i 'll tell him .
what 's up ?
i see . what do you do ?
i 'm sorry .
i know that 's why he ca n't make you happy .
i want to give a gift that is really meaningful .
yes . and suddenly i heard someone call my name . i turned around and there was this man looking at me . i did n't recognize him at all but he obviously knew who i was .
how much are you selling it for ?
well i would say that i m just drifting here in the pool .
why ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
have you thought about graduate school ?
no . but it will be a good school for me to get a parttime job in shanghai .
what 's the matter ?
i had to work in a bank account . in addition to a job they would be responsible for the past two years .
now listen ben . look i think it s a very good thing that a young man after he s done some very good work should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself and lie around and so on . but after a few weeks i believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his
you can be sure . i 've got a lot of work .
i 'm not sure . what do you want to eat ?
that 's great . i would love to eat a cow .
what a great idea !
pretty good sam . only the awful weather you know .
that s right . i ve never really liked it since i got here .
me too . i hate the car .
well i ve got some papers due .
really ? so what s the news ?
not too good yet . better than i was though .
i 'm going to the store would you like to go to an extra blanket ?
he 's a little sick under the weather .
i can understand .
sure .
what makes you say that ?
today is december twentythird two thousand and two .
how could you explain that ?
i was only kidding because of the bad team .
how did he know that ?
i 'm going to help bob .
oh i like scifi music and actress .
here are the notes .
yes i am afraid i have . but i know that i get on a business trip to see some friends .
it 's a great idea . let me see .
i 'm glad to hear that . would you like to go to the concert with me ?
that sounds interesting .
sure . it 's one of the biggest classical music events . have you ever been to the live show ?
well i know that we have but not a really good one . we can go to the gym and find it to be fun .
well . . . the final mostly mostly wet and the final . but please do n't believe me !
yeah it is . you know i had the greatest time ever .
is n't there anything less you 've done at the next board ?
oh speaking of the conductor he is indeed a genius . he did a perfect job . his name is menuhin a descendent of russian american immigrants .
yeah he s a very serious person .
if i had n't married an italian man i probably would n't be pregnant so often . and maybe i could raise pigs instead of bambinos !
oh yes i will . but can you tell me how to get to the meeting ?
yes i am . what 's wrong ?
no what did you want to do ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted at me
you mean you were n't speeding ?
why do you want to have a try ?
right now it 's a world of canada and the forbidden city .
yes . the scenery there is so breathtaking
really ?
it s an undergraduate offered by a bank of mine which is in good shape and easy to find out .
if i had a lot of money i would have to visit them .
yes . we love to put the lawn .
i think it is too hot for me .
you can take the shuttle to send the shuttle to grand central .
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
yes sir .
after a while crocodile .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
well we have espresso latte skinny latte skinny latte fancy coffee and americano .
just turn the tv .
it 's too expensive to keep fit .
yes please .
how do you know if there 's a program on this channel ?
well if you want to see a fixed amount of 50 cents for a minimum of 50 cents we can accept the 500 yuan . and we can exchange them for free if you want .
where can i find one ?
i 'm going to bill 's house .
what kind of music do you like ?
it 's too convenient and good to do so .
yes . then i will give you a call for you .
thanks . i can find it anywhere .
why do n't you get a pc ?
really ? i d like to do that .
try a singer . it has lime juice and over ice .
it 's our first time to be here so would you please arrange a schedule for us ?
yes . do you have a minute ?
thanks . i 'm so sorry .
yes i like collecting antiques .
haha that 's a good idea . i 'm like playing the piano .
i guess they can bring us a couple of different departments and also have a good life .
i know what you mean .
i do n't know why i ca n't watch them . i 'm crazy .
what was the reason ?
maybe i should just do that . i do n't mind being interviewed by the program but i do n't think i should start flat at weekends .
it is such a nice place .
sure what would you like to discuss ?
bye .
i 'm glad to hear that . i heard her boyfriend is in love with someone .
well she was definitely taking a walk .
yeah i think that we can find something . let 's go and have a drink .
no problem .
when i was a teacher i 'd say it 's the most of the game i have first time to play . do you want to show her ?
really ?
yes . the ice will soon be over .
mmm how much is it ?
well i 've noticed that this is a sign of things i can get together with my friends .
that 's wonderful . i 'll definitely be there .
you can do it . all the moon cakes are dressed in the swimming pool . it 's called the china 's favorite .
did you promise him ?
no i 'm a teacher .
yes you are right . he 's too old to move .
wow ! what a pity !
he is finishing up a special continue education program for executives . he can continue working taking a few of classes here and there and in 2 years he will complete his mba .
i will do that .
i will . see you then .
is he really ?
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
i 'm not sure . it could be the tires . let 's stop here .
what do you think ?
it 's amazing . i can imagine people who have such a crush on those handsome guys .
is it ? i 've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
for instance the mobile phone seriously the attention of people from work and study .
i 'm not sure that is bad .
actually it 's not the fault of the mobile phone . but people should have a proper attitude towards it . mobile phone is a tool serving people not the fetters restricting them .
but why do n't you join us ? we have to work overtime .
of course . i 'm not an assistant . they know the boss .
well you 're supposed to take the advice . i guess they do n't have to cut back on the ground .
that 's right . i can only work on the weekend .
why do n't you try to get another seat ? you need more information .
you 're right . i 'll do it .
no problem .
yeah . i find it incredible how can i stand with the air ?
but what are the sources of water pollution ?
they could generally be divided into two categories direct and indirect contaminant sources .
can you tell me how to get to the office ?
oh yes . i like them .
but what about the indirect ones ?
indirect sources include that enter the water supply from or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater .
and i want to hear that some dark clouds moving in .
sure . it 's an issue asking for everyone 's participation .
here 's your schedule . after this meeting we will visit the factory and have another meeting with the production manager . and you 'll be having dinner with our director .
thank you for your advice .
certainly . she is pretty serious about it .
nothing really . how about you ?
what 's that ?
i was robbed .
how about sick days ?
we can begin the position in the computer lab .
that sounds like a good idea .
i 'm not quite sure . i think the manager is very good . her office is quite strict with her .
so what kind of solution do you recommend ?
maybe . but i 'll look out for it .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
that 's really special .
what 's the matter ?
i would love to but i have never been to the movies .
the ending is a bit of a surprise . it 's a little good movie .
fine . i 'll be expecting you around two .
how about at the subway entrance .
when did you say ?
really ? i 'm glad to meet you .
see you .
i got it . i think my bank is going to look for a new one . that is the only reason i have to go .
well that 's true . i guess it 's the same kind of thing . when did your friend get older you get the receipt ?
let me go and check my car .
what about the car ?
i 'll have to write you a ticket and <unk> your vehicle .
oh my god . i have n't seen such a place .
good afternoon ! sit down please . how are you ?
i 'm fine thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it 's hard to keep track of everything around here .
i will explain it again . you ll find someone else 's extension <unk> .
miss lu have you got any experience in restaurant service ?
yes . i am going to san francisco .
what type of work did you like ?
ok i will . bye .
a korean film called friends starring sang .
i wish it was n't too bad . but i do n't think i could be able to see it in the library .
how did you like the movie ?
i thought it was pretty good .
really ? i ca n't say i agree .
is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ?
oh i 'm not sure .
i guess it could happen .
so is it free to buy one ?
really ? i will try my best to repay the company and the health insurance .
well it 's important to make a statement so that you can get a good salary .
i 'm going to quit the job .
yeah . i am going to be like this .
what 's the flight number ?
right now we have the best going to do that . but we re going to be late .
that would be great . where shall we go ?
what time are you going to start ?
i d like to go out to eat .
i m sorry but friday is fully booked .
how about saturday morning ?
hello ! is there anything i can do for you ?
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
i 'm afraid you 've parked on a double yellow line sir .
for example ?
i know . will you have it then ?
good idea . shall we go out tomorrow ?
yes . i want to take some photos first .
have you brought your student card ?
my telephone number is .
could you hold it for me ? i will check for you .
can you tell me how to get to the jade buddha temple ?
good . thank you for coming to us . if you would like to ask me the job .
we have an impressive understanding .
don t worry about that . it s no problem .
it 's so cold in the winter .
i like winter too but sometimes it gets too cold .
before he made the top three i was so nervous . i just fear that he might be knocked out .
seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? that 's a good idea . let 's go !
hey darling i think i might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . i was so relaxed . it felt as if i were in another world .
but it 's so quiet .
i 've got it . i like the sound of stepping on the snow very much .
oh yes . you 've been very helpful .
ok . can i see the menu please ?
how big was it ?
that 's wonderful ! he was too desperate to find some other way .
okay . let 's go .
yeah . they are a team player .
yes why ?
what happened ?
certainly . and i 'll take one .
so he had a good ear . the right hand is so funny and he was having a conversation with it .
my parents wanted me to show them to her . they were all very helpful .
that 's great . taking a walk on the beach and the sunshine . . well let 's get to the river .
wow . it s too hard to get to sleep .
what is your proposal ?
oh i am sorry that i have no idea of that .
neither . the game ended in two all .
but i still think ac milan's defence seems better organized .
but the brazilian is tougher .
can you beat me ?
he is in his late thirties .
oh yes . she must be getting a heavy smoker .
i think that the only way to go shopping .
i know you would be a perfect fit . it would be a shame if you would like to try it .
how much is it ?
i think so . the concert was so beautiful .
very good idea . sometimes such pictures can show the house 's richness .
i see . what else do they have ?
i think so . it s a little too cold for me to do this . i would like to go to the summer palace . i could pick you up at your home and the conference .
do you mind telling me that ?
i m very fond of playing the chess .
ok . how many people are there in your party ?
some are very nice . how much do you spend ?
i like taking photos .
i think that s because it has become a very complicated hobby .
yes i do .
i 'll be right back .
that would be lovely .
not much . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .
oh you 're kidding . i 'm going to meet with you later .
well i <unk> n't think so at first . but as we started talking i found his extremely funny and witty . i could n't stop laughing at his jokes ! we have so much in common . we like the same teams music and most amazingly we both love chinese food ! i have the feeling that we are going to be great friends .
it seems you two are a good match . what qualities do you look for in a friend ?
there 's nothing definite i think . i do n't have a list or anything but when i first meet somebody i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have radar h
well that 's something i 've never heard of . but if you as me what i value most in a friend i would have to say honesty .
i agree . you ca n't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .
yeah i know . i know a friend in need is a friend indeed . i do n't need fairweather friends either .
i like playing chess .
it s a great idea .
hard to dance to do .
how about samba ?
yes . playing chess is a very aggressive experience . all the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . whenever i start a chess game i ca n't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all stand ready to kill .
do you really like playing those games ?
no . i do n't have enough money to buy some of them . but i 'm afraid it must be cheaper to buy some of my daily life .
i like the best . i do n't like the fresh air .
i see . well the scenery there is breathtaking . i would n't be so heavy .
it s ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .
oh it 's love at first sight . when will you see each other again ?
he did n't say but he said he would call me .
maybe he is busy with his work . just wait and try not to think about it too much !
oh steve . stop it ! i am a bit nervous ! what if he does n't call ?
come on mary you 're a total catch . i bet he will call you . do n't worry . you will be nervous .
thank you steve . you 're always so encouraging .
the pleasure is mine .
thank you !
what 's the date today ?
which man ?
no she is n't . my brother likes his teachers and very much .
you can always make a sandwich .
i think so .
i appreciate what you saying .
yes . quite good . and you need to keep it at first .
oh i 'm glad that you have a good time .
what ? you are such an expert on it ?
in the college . i do n't know how to use it .
what school did you like ?
because i like to get dressed in a new dress . look at the color and the material is too thick . but i like the color of this year . it 's too small for me to wear .
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
yeah it helps me to stay in my life .
good . i think we 'll make it .
here you are .
it sure is . look at this map .
oh i see . he is an old man and very young .
i hope it 's too late to say goodbye . i have to get going !
why is it so ?
yes i am .
i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
let me see . look ! that looks like the jeans but you need something to go with the jeans . that looks good .
i 'm ready to make myself a new meal too .
i do n't know . the problem is that i did n't even notice the phone .
what kind of skirt do you have ?
i think so .
ok . put on this apron first .
let me try . . . oh no . you got a pencil . so it 's on . . .
we talked to our older brothers and sisters last night and got the scoop on what that job is all about .
oh congratulations . how long did you stay ?
it 's ok .
i ca n't believe it .
well now you 're really going to freak out when i tell you who aced it . . what do you think ?
if you try to adapt yourself to your destination's local time you can have a good time . so for example you will feel better after you have another job .
what 's the problem ?
i will bring you a ticket and suspend your driver 's license for 3 months .
hey i started feeling kind of sick . now i am really tired .
no . he said i was in primary school but he gave me a lame excuse and so i pressed him on it .
i 've never heard mary cursed anybody . but i heard she cursed another driver when she drove me back home today .
did he have a lot of homework ?
well as we say the rest is history . . .
he said that he would celebrate his girlfriend 's birthday .
no he did n't !
i do wish i could lose weight
i think so .
he was just having a cat .
so he has no family to do this ?
we better have another girlfriend .
because he stayed with me all the time that night .
yes i did . i just told you that i wanted to go out with you and when i was in the library . i told you i was late telling you i happened .
did he see his face ?
did they see the results ?
what 's the matter ?
he did n't make it out so i never thought .
well as we say the rest is history . . .
then he is really lucky .
alright . thanks for the advice .
well he 's really a nice <unk> .
oh i really like it .
me too . i 'm always in shape when i eat my food .
i 'm fine thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it 's hard to keep track of everything around here .
what are you talking about ?
no i am single .
i see . that 's probably a good idea . i 'll bet he 'd better take some details of this job .
i remember now . i met her before .
that 's true .
we 're having some friends over . what do you want ?
sounds good . we can leave directly there .
i 'm just thinking about it for a romantic new year and i are too sick to eat . do you have any suggestions ?
oh that 's too bad .
i must meet someone at the airport tomorrow afternoon .
do you go to the city every day ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
you ca n't take that tone .
what 's the matter ?
yes that 's right .
i hid so that it could n't see me . slowly it got closer and closer until . . .
it s very kind of you . i hope you don t mind me saying that you have a tight schedule .
i 'm going to <unk> the lawn .
do you have your flight number ?
and she 's good at sports too . she knows how to play tennis and basketball .
do n't worry . i will help you .
do you know if she 's read this one ?
so what do you want to see in beijing ?
thanks . i promise .
my name is judy wang .
i always like you .
sure . i 'll never get to work on it .
it 's half past seven .
i really did n't mean to forget it .
i know but it 's hard to forget . i mean it 's no use to tell you .
what was your problem ?
i m going to be late today .
please hurry .
well we have to stay in bed for another ten minutes .
do you like it ?
no thanks . i do n't know .
sure . why not ? i think it 's so helpful .

what 's the matter ?
i see . by the way how many pieces of luggage do i have to pay altogether ?
which one interests you sir ?
and i must apologize for the inconvenience .
sure .
i need you to turn the table .
that 's ok .
let me know if it 's true .
no . the gas station is on the left .
i know . but could you tell me how to get there ?
you re in america now my british friend . we just call it football .
oh right . so i can t quite follow what s going on . . . who s winning ?
the giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked but the have the ball and there pretty close to the end of the first aid screen .
wow ! what a hit !
yeah he tackled him so hard his helmet came off .
is he ok ?
he looks like a very good guy .
i guess he hit him too hard the just called a penalty on the home team .
the giants ?
yeah .
do you want me to put in a good word for you ?
what happened ? why did everyone get so quiet ?
the s just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . we re losing again .
yeah i just got them . i started playing ice hockey in a community league . so i finally got myself new skates .

oh yeah ? which team ?
the rockets .
really ? i think we play you guys next week . well i have to go to practice . see you later .
all right see you later .
we are going to climb a cliff on the colorado river .
how hard is the climb ?
it is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .
what did you do last week ?
we rappelled down the side of a 300 foot cliff . it 's very exciting .
wow ! that sounds like a lot of fun . i m sorry i missed it .
well you should come this weekend . i think you could do the climb .
yeah i will . see you then !
ok see you .
i 'm just watching some television .
i 'm so bored . i do n't know what i 'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning .
me too . do you think we are boring people ?
i do n't think we are boring . it 's just that we do n't have any hobbies .
that 's right . what do you think we should do as a hobby ?
i like playing the piano .
i like to play the piano for fun .
yeah . that can be a good hobby .
hobbies are great . i 'm going to make a list of all the things i like to do .
that 's a great idea . i 'm going to do the same .
it was exciting !
that must have been wonderful . do anything interesting ?
well we went bungee jumping when we were in australia .
wow ! isn t that dangerous ?
a little but the rush was worth it .
tell me about it .
you guys are working around the clock i know . that guy dave next to zina never leaves .
500 feet ! i would never be able to do that .
yeah it was scary but exhilarating .
what a pity .
yes he is . he loves the girl very much .
no i ca n't .
it is really hard to deal with higher quality .
well i just can t seem to fall asleep and fall asleep .
so how can you get the price ?
well maybe we 'll have to celebrate . tell us about the first time .
oh my god !
yes what 's the advantage of the schedule ?
yeah you know what to do now . the ball is excellent . . . but the ball is also a little bit risky .
alright . what if you want to have a try ?
that 's no problem . we have been dating for over 7 years .
i have a lot of golf now . we can go to the beach and enjoy a drink .
yes they are .
they want to be there .
i do n't know . something rotten here ?
more and more people have the chance to go to a jazz mall .
no they are n't . i 'm sure they are the groom and the other .
i want to tell you that i 've been thinking of going to the university of next month . i want to get a job as soon as possible .
i know so . but some people say why they do n't just sand it so much .
will they be coming to church ?
i suppose so . i do n't want to be there any supper .
what a pity !
yes it will .
i guess the bride s her .
wow . sounds great .
that would be a relief .
how long will it take ?
yes of course .
wow ! how highclass . . . a new pair for each day . . .
yes that sounds like fun .
that 's cool .
yes . i bet even though we have to become a better child .
well that 's very sensible of you . if you purchase at least we can begin to pay you with a credit card and we can begin to pay you in 60 days .
yes i agree . i think we ll be able to travel on other river .
that sounds great . i 'll take it .
it 's a good thing to do .
yes . there is also a travel agency nearby who would prefer the first one .
really ? well what do you recommend ? i am sorry .
it 's at 8 o 'clock .
well i 'm afraid that 's too late . can you make it for me ?
that 's true . especially in the movies the whole country is often a bit small . but to be honest it 's not so hot .
i see . they do an incredible job . the sand of the environment that catches insects and turns all the passengers .
sure . where would you like to be ?
and it 's so popular in the winter .
yes . if we do n't find someone who is right there he has no problems with the correct person anywhere he must be crazy .
well i guess we can have a favorite show .
i 'll be fine .
anything else ?
thanks .
no thanks . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . i think i 'll be late .
just a minute . i need to double check the details .

do you think we 'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ?
wow ! how many different people are .
i was so excited . are you free on saturday ?
no .
i 'm sorry i 'll do that .
i do n't care .
i 'm happy to help .
i do n't know how i can do it .
it 's not so bad . sometimes it 's as bad as the public .
it 's hard to say . but i can tell you the truth .
then i can use the net for phone too .
that 's what i thought .
yeah . here it is .
you can ask her out for drinks after work .

ok let 's go !
in america most children start primary school at the age of five .
do they have to go to school on saturdays ?
yes and it is worth watching .
oh that 's a good idea . i do n't mind going swimming in the evening . i heard that you have an appointment with a family .
that 's right . having an excellent benefits package of all over the world is a must .
it 's 10 yuan .
what was that ?
the line is through now please go ahead .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i have a dinner party at seven . is that ok ?
yes i am .
i do wish i could lose weight .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
i understand .
so if i do n't want to put up with him in the mood i will go crazy .
what ever you say ?
i think so . one of my favorites are good at cooking .
well there 's nothing i can do about it . but you know there are always pros and cons to death .

for protection . some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air .
so there is n't air in the glass boxes ?
no there is n't . they are all vacuumed .
how long will it take ?
yeah they all come from a very ancient time .
hey look at the threeleg cup . i 've seen it on tv .
i see . all carryon items must be able to fit under the seat or in the overhead bin .
ok . i ll see you later .
i love being with a band about a happy restaurant .
hey andrew . how 's everything with work ?
ok i guess . my boss has been on my back recently .

oh lots of things . mostly training new people .
i 'll see you there at ten o 'clock .
the same to you .
why is that ?
it does n't matter .
well thank you for coming . we hope to see you again sometime soon .
are they designed differently ?
indeed they are . keeping staff happy is the only way to be replaced by mail .
understand . but how can you stand the new ebb ?
we 're going to buy some of them .
in a way i would n't like to work without keys .
well . . how about friday afternoon ?
what time would you like to go ?
really ? what 's the matter ?
the best way to reach the king 's seat by the general desk . it was a very comfortable experience and fast food is built in many fine print out the right direction .
what about tomorrow afternoon ?
no problem .
i would like to order number 17 that for you .

that 's what i am thinking . i will try my best to get round and have a try .
what can i help you with ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've already booked the meeting for you and it is the most important thing . we can do some shopping with you .
we have a lot of coal . the prices are all out of them . we are our products in this city are on sale this month .
is that right ?
yes it is .
what would your current colleague say we 're just going to get the ticket and we 'll send you your luggage to the office .
it 's actually a onebedroom apartment .
then what about the other things ?
what do we do to get our staff ?
is there anything you can do next time ?
for instance the mobile phone seriously the attention of people from work and study . but people say it is hard to do the work with the specialist when they left the products .
well i know that many people have guns there . i think we are a better one .
no i do n't . i 'm sorry . it 's my duty .
if i ever decide to take a job i could also get the job and send my resume to the email .
of course i could ! let me pay for it .
i know that . but what kind of music is it ?
what do you do in the store ?
yeah . i like them very much .
so he said he 'd sell me one for twenty dollars . a fourhundreddollar camera for twenty bucks .
you mean like a minimum of less than a year ?
i just look around . maybe i can take a look . what should i do ?
it must be dreadful to grow old .
catch the lift on the right . you should pay as attention to what you eat .
ok . cool !
yes . i have been told that it has started at the beginning of my own company .
i 'm not sure . it could be the tires . let 's stop here .
yes i 've read about it . i can t get it easily .
you 're lucky . and i have been trying to keep up with the pay .
what 's the price of the hardcover ?
you 're right ! we have to make a special decision by the end of this week . this is a bill of my dreams !
yes . how much would you like to pay ?
how about going there to have a look now ?
what 's the occasion ? you won the lottery ?
oh that 's too bad . i think it 's really a good deal .
what time does the reservation start ?
ok . whatever became of music i 'm not good at all .
that 's not why many people have the same opinion .
well you know sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . they may insist they are sick when they are not .
we really appreciate your efforts . you know mr . zhang and i believe that our cooperation will be worth a good relationship .
i just had a house with me and my parents .
oh that 's too bad . you can ask her to give you a ring .
i felt quite nervous when i was in a relationship with the manager .
i really want to go so i hope that she is and better .
i heard her . she is a very famous woman .
she ll be very glad to know that he s married .
i think i might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . i was so relaxed . it felt as if i were in another world .
i am thinking about how much i can spend .
what school do you go to ?
i am studying languages .
i 'm glad you came . i want to show you how to use your own business .
yes i did . my friend and i hiked in a very wild part of the national forest .
well i 'd better get back to you .
i 'm going to take a walk .
do you have a second permit for another one ?
and how long does it take ?
i think you 'll have to pay cash .
yes i live alone in a flat near my work place .
do you think that teenagers get a lot of their bad behaviour from tv and movies ?
usually i go to london twice a year but i go three or four times a year .
i 'm not sure . you can go to the hotel first .
oh i see . when is it going to start ?
that 's very kind of you . how long have you been like this ?
i know i 'm sorry . but i could n't help it .
i would n't worry about it .
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
neither do i . let 's go and have a drink .
it 's very kind of you .
yes . the language is hard to learn but it 's interesting .
it is ok with me . i enjoy being busy and learning new things .
you can use your deposit book or your credit card . and of course you can use our ebanking .
thank you for all your help .
yes i do . i like to dance every week .
that 's really cool . let 's go .
why do n't we go bar ?
what did you do ?
wilson will be fine .
we 'll stay there for about three days .
there is a great canyon vast grasslands ancient forests and mountain lakes .
i used to play chess when i was ten years ago .
yes . i find chinese chess is the most difficult to learn . they are so complicated .
yeah .
ok .
see you .
he is so humorous .
i m glad to hear that . in case he s not insured the hospital will never accepts any patient .
he has no sense .
yes i have the same feeling .
too bad man . i hate her at the long jump .
i know .
yes but can you show me the other colour ones ?
really ? i heard that you moved to this town several days ago . the subway was really full .
have you ever tried taking vitamins ? i know you have good knowledge of them .
what kind of wine do you like ?
i 'll let you know when i get in .
how did the business trip go ?
do you want your address ?
goodbye and have a good flight .
that 's very honest . oh that 's too sweet of you .
yes i can so that . i can n't wait to sit down .
i 'd like to tell you that our prices are very competitive .
i do n't think so .
what do you think of the river ?
i see . maybe i can find the results .
i would love to hear the birds singing .
but if the sunshine is too strong it may be too strong to put in a england .
but if the sunshine is too strong it might damage the eyes and the skin .
well do n't worry . i 've got to call you now .
okay . i 'll get it for you .
i am sorry that i will check out the price .
two of us will be sending a manager and a manager which is quite limited .
do you have a good stereo ?
a foot massage sounds like a great idea . they are very relaxing . i think that we can find a summer massage .
well if you live in other as long enough you love them just as much .
thank you . i will take it .
yes . and suddenly i heard someone call my name . i turned around and there was this man looking at me . i did n't recognize him at all but he obviously knew who i was .
that s true . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
yes . why ?
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
just asking ? but why is your face burning like mad ? ahhuh someone has a crush on jenny does n't he ?
no he 's the kind of thing . i tried to put him on a spot . but the nurse had a tourniquet . i ca n't find anything .
come on ted do n't be such a chicken . if you like her you 've got to tell her . maybe she likes you .
i am so glad that i was n't happy with her .
but that 's better than keeping everything to yourself . you 've got to let her know . come on ! you 've got to take a chance ! even though you are rejected it 's not the end of the world ! there 's nothing to lose is there ?
happy new year thomas . how much did you have in mind ?
not that great . . . thank you for telling me .
let me try . i 'm always interested .
i guess that 's what i 'm going to do . i need to spend my time in the summer .
it 's very emotional .
here 's a 10 .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you . they are thirsty for more .
it was so beautiful . i didn t like them because i love you .
thank you .
sounds good . let 's go .
either way . i only need a few minutes .
thank you .
fine . what time would you like us to deliver ?
great . we will talk about it this afternoon .
what time is it ?
how about football ?
why not go out and get a drink ?
what are your parents going to be there ?
yes good idea . the bus is really charming .
but i want to tell you something about your family .
this guy i got it in singapore . here do you want to try out ?
let me get a few things for you . i want to get her a new suit .
what do you do for your birthday ?
well i do n't get along well with each other . i can understand why we are always willing to make it easier .
i 'm not sure as good as i thought .
yes she is . but she is very intelligent .
oh i see .
what kind of style do you like ?
you should know that i love her .
i see . i 'll do it for you .
wow ! she 's gorgeous .
when ?
you 're right . her eyes are so smart .
yes i guess you 're right . but they need to get a bonus from the body to finish by ten . that 's what i eat .
thank you for telling me this . what should i do ?
you want some chinese food ?
certainly .
i 'm just waiting for someone .
i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
oh i need to go to the movies .
why ?
i 'm afraid you 've parked on a double yellow line sir .
yeah . i guess it 's nice to meet you .
i can pick you up at the gate of your company .
i know . let 's go .
how about at 1100 ?
ok .
yes . what can i do for you sir ?
you are welcome .
ok . goodbye .
i 'm glad to help you .
we 'll have to discuss the contract in soon .
goodbye then . hope to see you soon .
excuse me miss . can you show me my seat ?
goodbye .
sure . have you got anywhere in mind ?
i 'm starving so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .
that italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . do you want to go there ?
i 'm not really in the mood for italian actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy .
if you want spicy food then i 'd recommend going to a thai indian or chinese restaurant . how about that chinese buffet on <unk> road ?
i really like that restaurant you get a lot for your money there . but they 've westernized their food so it 's not actually that spicy .
you 're right . most of their dishes have sweet sauces . we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us .
the taj ? they 're a bit expensive but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
the taj it is then .
shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
they 'll still charge us a corkage fee .
that 's right . it 'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .
do n't worry about money . i 'll treat you tonight .
are you sure ? we could go dutch .
no i 'll pay . it 's my turn anyway . you paid last time .
i wo n't argue with that ! let 's go !
i do n't know . if i have n't married i 'll find a place that is n't more than one .
oh no . i do n't know .
it 's not far away .
i do n't want to be sick .
they are cute .
thank you mom . how 's the weather like this ?
thank you lisa .
yes i have been working in a department store . where do you want to go ?
do you have anything to declare ?

how long did you stay there ?
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
she has a pretty little sense .
dark blue .
he prefers suits to jackets .
judge from his look he 's a very serious person .
as a matter of fact he is .
do n't believe him . he 's a liar .
we cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth .
she 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
they have moved to chicago .
why ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
for 2000 rib .
that 's fine sir . we 've just got a new account with you and there 's a problem with us .
i think it 's only about 25 dollars .
ok . . . so the total amount is 36 . 00 .
it is so hard to believe this little thing is so valuable to us .
i don t really want to have a hard retirement plan .
i 'm afraid we ca n't now .
i thought about it but i 'm sure my wife will be able to get to my office .
i thought you 'd be interested in seeing the famous season .
i 'm going to take a walk .
it 's very kind of you . let me have another try .
dad and mom ?

i like spring too . we can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air .
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
you can always make a sandwich .
i let you know where that is .
i have to do something to help you .
uh . . . yeah right . . .
we 'd better go out for a walk .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring .
how about summer ?
i dislike it most .
why ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
but sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
oh i 'm glad to hear that .
i really hate this weather .
cool fellow what 's the date today buddy ?
it 's . . . oh it 's the 1st april fool 's day .
you forgot all about it did n't you ?
on 20th may 1963 .
do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ?
27th day of the fourth month .
by the way could you tell me when the film will begin ?
it will begin at five thirty .
make it three days before the start .
i 'm afraid you ca n't do that .
i do n't want to miss it today .
it was really a nightmare . then i tried to land the night and as i as the day was busy as i did .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . would you like to buy a new one ?
you know sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . they may insist they are sick when they are not .
yes i see . it 's dead .
yes . and i m so disappointed with it .
i see . thank you .
that 's true . i guess i was too excited to pay my attention .
i ca n't wait to see the sights . let 's go .
yes . i hope we can make it .
me too . recently i 've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them .
oh yeah . things are great and the classes that keeps in a week . i 'll give you some advice .
i 'm afraid not . i 've already gone through the internet .
yes . i can t wait to see the dragon boat race .
i like the way that the world is calm down . i like singing .
let 's hope it is !
when did you start worrying about it ?
crazy !
yes i see . i 'll take one .
i know . but it 's not like i am a grownup .
how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look ? i remember there is one in the gym .
that 's a good idea . i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
me too . what did you do there ?
i have n't decided yet but i think the olympic mascots are a must .
i agree . they 're very lovely especially huan .
oh i see . you 're going to love your vase .
the five dolls are sold together as a set and they 're priced according to the size . the bigger they are the more expensive .
oh i see . if i buy more than a set can i get any discount ?
i do n't think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now .
any other ideas ?
there are lots of things such as postcards key chains posters and various arts and crafts .
it all sounds great . we can go there after the match . i ca n't wait to see what they have .
it s a lot better than i expected .
the weather is wonderful here .
oh yes . it s usually cold in the winter .
i heard about that . where are you going ?
if you want to fly it is at one of the five o 'clock station .
but they do n't . it looks like we are not as cheap as we are .
people are from asia to the united states and we have to work overtime .
i like to see them so it 's a tradition .
what 's so terrible about it ?
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
is it really ? i do n't like the fact .
how about a love story then ?
i 've been to london before but it 's been really interesting .
really ? how often do you exercise ?
yes . look at the pattern !
well whatever i m glad you re doing well .
yes i like it here . i must be back as soon as i have a bus .
no . i haven t seen you for ages . have you ever been there ?
how often do you play tennis ?
i 'm sorry it took so long .
yes . i have . would you mind telling me how to use it ?
i m glad to hear that you finally found what you had in .
we 've got a spot in the woods and it 's a bit of a shade .
my son just went into a car .
oh that 's too bad . is it your right arm or your left arm ?
you know i m going to be running a birthday party this saturday .
no you didn t . this place was in the mail about three weeks ago .
what do you mean ?
could you pass the first ?
would you like to withdraw any money ?
do n't mention it . i m sure you ll find it difficult to get on well .
i m still waiting for confirmation . i did n't mean to forget our wedding anniversary .
how many people are you married ?
i did . he s a lot of noise .
well i had to have something to do . the phone me just came in . i didn t know what to do .
ah you look so upset . i wish you were coming to the hospital .
i know . i have to be up to get up early tomorrow .
that s normal . why didn t you quit being a little longer ?
i drink a lot of wine .
i did n't know that . i thought we 'd be fine .
i remember you are in love .
oh i took a shine to him when we met for the first time . but it comes and goes .
it 's greek to me .
so the reform can not be carried out well .
the government is making efforts to change the amount of money .
easier said than done .
he is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
what ? it s only 9 p . m . now . why today he went to bed so early ?
he ran four miles and came back dead beat .
oh i see .
i 'm tired of your opinions . who do you think you are !
oh i 'm glad .
why not ?
i 'm sorry .
i lost ?
you are so thoughtful .
i feel the same way .
it must be dreadful to grow old .
it sure is . he has no one to turn to very miserable indeed .
have n't you heard that he is in prison ?
what ? beg your pardon .
john is in prison now . he was copped outstealing .
i just can n't believe my ears !
i ca n't deny that . she is so beautiful that i fell in love with her at the first sight .
but i heard that she had a threeyearold girl .
i can not belive that . it must be cooked up by someone .
of course i wo n't chill out . opportunity knocks only once .
you should strike while the iron is hot .
you 're right . i will have a talk to her about that .
yes my first marriage was a failure .
yeah . but his relation with sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife .
he deserved it .
sorry i can t .
why not ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m sorry .
i 'm not sure i 'll be back so soon .

i 'm sorry . i 'll ask next time .

i got 500 a week .
thank you . good evening mr . dean .
would you tell us your name please ?
i 'm helen baker .
glad to meet you ms . baker .
glad to meet you too .
where are you from ms . baker ?
i 'm from new zealand .
what do you do for a living ?
i manage one of the ski lodges . it s a great job i can spend a lot of my time outdoors and i also get to ski for free all season .
what do you teach ?
and what s your problem ?
here is the fare and keep the change please .
no why should i ? i don t feel like it . besides i m in such a bad mood .
yeah why not ?
what time will you be back ?
i m glad you re feeling better .
why didn t you just answer my question directly ? why would chinese answer questions this way ? i simply asked if you did it or not . it s a very simple question . and chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer .
yeah . you can find something nice and warm .
tomorrow ? no i 'm afraid i would n't be able to . i 'm going out of the town on business .
do you need another drink ?
well when is it convenient for you ?
thank you for calling . i really appreciate your help .
no i have n't but i 've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper .
what kind of job are you looking for ?
i 'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the it field .
you have n't had any experience in either of those fields .
i know . but i 'd like to try . look here are some advertisements that i 've cut out .
i was turned down again . it s frustrating . i guess you ve got to teach me some skills .
me ? i m even less experienced than you are .
at least you know what american women generally like in a man .
believe it or not i guess american women like a man in good shape which chinese women may not care about so much . that s my honest opinion . i know you have been trying very hard .
american men are naturally taller than chinese men . so even if i exercise there aren t many chances .
no that s not true . i ve met two american women who were married to chinese . but those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is chan ? he s small and short . but i bet he can have any american woman he wants .
you re right . i m still a little worried about how to control his behavior and his temper .
why don t you try then ? even if it doesn t help you find an american girl you could still have a stronger and healthier body . you won t lose anything by doing that .
hi don . what a surprise !
yeah i saw someone walking like you but i wasn t sure . we haven t seen each other for how long ? almost three months ? but you look quite different now .
have you noticed what has changed ?
oh you look quite slender and more <unk> . what have you been taking ? are you on a diet ?
yes . i m on a diet but i ve not taken anything . i just eat less and exercise more . and it really worked in the past three months . i ve lost twelve pounds .
wow ! that s great . i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals but it s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . also you know old habits are hard to break .
what kind of exercise do you think i do ? i just go to dance everyday after work . i m taking an amateur dance class . i dance two hours everyday .
dance ? you only go dancing ? that 's not hard . i can do that .
sure . join my class next week .
ok . i will be coming .
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
oh i 'm not sure .
i got it . what do you think ?
what 's the matter ?
here 's the key .
all right . are you qualified for the position ?
have you taken it yet ?
yes . i have a very special offer and a thorough knowledge of the training in my previous company .
oh . i 'm sorry . i thought you were n't supposed to be serious .
what do you think is the teacher for a baby so you have nothing to do ?
no i think that i 'd like to do that .
that 's no problem . we can offer you a 5 000 yuan if you were to buy from that .
well maybe we could talk about it and make it that by the end of the damages then .
if i do n't know how to use the course
i suppose so . what should i do ? i 've got some help .
i see . who were your parents ?
i really do n't care how to use it .
i do n't know . you must have some good exercise .
what are you talking about ? my alarm even has a lipstick on it .
well let me see . you know i 'm not a good one but it 's a bit too dangerous .
whatever . i 'm gonna try my best to keep my face up with my legs .
no that 's the only thing to do .
i see . what you mean is that all right ? i don t know what you are going to do with the whole staff .
i 'm just shopping . how about you ?
we 'd better leave it up .
sure . i will be there .
you are really a tough dog . you know how it 's about going to be a family .
you got it ! it 's a little bit small but i 'm not sure if the color is right .
i know but that 's a bit pricey .
i do n't know . i mean i have n't n't n't eaten anything all day . but i really do n't get a chance to lose anything .
that 's amazing .
yes it does .
i like scary food .
did you happen to do that ?
that 's my wife !
well i guess so .
what are you going to do now ?
no .
yeah . i m going to keep in touch with you .
oh how nice . well anyway i can t get together with what s the matter .
i 'm afraid i 'm very ill . but i 'm going to have to work late .
you know what i mean . i m not a big fan of tv shows . they re only one child .
all right . i 'll do it .
the total amount is 45 .
oh i see . where is the taxi stand ?
i don t think that is too expensive . can you come down any idea ?
yeah . i used to it for a while but i 'm not sure if i can get it .
i think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you .
really ? i ll take it .
ok . i ll pick you up around 6
i see . are there any seats available ?
that s my pleasure .
well you can have it for eleven hundred dollars .
yes i 'm a little confused .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
what 's the difference between having a look at your computer and the internet ?
well he 's got no trouble .
it 's for a while . it 's done .
it 's quite convenient for you to make sure that it 's good .
wait . what about the data off there ?
he is cute too .
that 's nice . my wife is very smart and much appreciate .
well i have to write the proposal . i 'm pretty excited about it .
fortunately things are changing these years .
i think that i would be better if you spoke to customer service .
no i 've been looking forward to having a hard time .
so cool . let 's call it a deal .
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
sounds great .
aright . i 'll talk to you later .
really ?
well you 're right . i guess i 'll meet many people in that department .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
i 'll see you later then !
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
what 's a number of things ?
nice to see you too . it s been a long time .
i guess so . i ve got to get it .
you like what ?
can you help me with it ?
don t worry about that bob . i ve got a new job and i m going to look at the problem .
i wrote it out a couple of dollars and it s not a hole .
oh i 'm glad to hear that . where is the taxi ?
we really should n't have come down so would we ?
it 's a furnished two bedroom flat in a threestory building on campus .
and how about your spanish ?
can you also take my home and record it in my bag ?
i know it s expensive but it s too expensive to get away from the old city .
it 's in the bedroom .
is there a living room ?
this is the kitchen . . .
i will be coming right now .
have you talk to your director about it ?
thank you .
do you really think so ?
yes i do . if you ask around other people will tell you the same thing .
i think in some way it is an act of god but in another way it just is caused by us .
for example ?
like for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
oh i see . fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things .
really ? that 's a in the wind .
yes it 's really a good place .
he looks very young .
it 's nice .
oh you didn t see me ! you were an exaggerating student . i thought you were only doing what .
you mean you didn t have to eat any foreign food ?
i am sure you will . in fact all the results are difficult .
have you ever heard the ads say anything bad about their products ?
do you think i should try to stay at home ?
how about next week ?
can i pay by credit card ?
i 'm still hungry .
no i 'd rather go out . the chinese food here is rather different from what i had at home . maybe we can try some other food today . . . what about that allyoucaneat place we passed the other day the one over in the shopping center ?
is that spelt m a c or m c ?
i 'm not really into it . i do n't like it .
i see . did you lose any weight ?
i see . then i 'll try a new restaurant .
i think so .
that 's fate .
i feel sorry for her .
maybe this is god 's will .
we have two cleaning ladies . but both of them have received little education .
most cleaning ladies are illiterate . but some of them do a very nice job .
but i actually dislike another lady . she is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . but the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . she would tell you what to do and where to put things .
i 'd like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
oh come on ! just a little exercise . it 's for your health .
could you point me in that direction ?
we have all kinds of sports and we like to listen to classic music .
it 's a great idea .
well we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . the trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the workout plan .
what else ? what kind of drugs does he have ?
since everyone is different your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . then you 'llbe taught all the necessary techniques to us
sounds pretty good . how much do you charge ?
let me see . . . it 's 40 dollars per night .
perhaps one month . i 'll just have a try at first .
i think that i will give me a definite answer .
yes i do . i 'm fond of playing the chess and i 'm very keen on playing cards .
oh that s interesting and but what kind of things ?
several things for example various coins stamps stones and so on .
yeah . i got it .
yes stones .
well i can t just image it .
i 'm sorry i 'm very busy . what about you ?
thank you . i will .
that 's great !
well thank you again for coming to us .
yes . and i 'm also very busy right now .
can you repeat all that ?
so you plan on washing your clothes here from now on ?
great ! work is really busy now but it 's fun .
i like digital barbie !
so you 're saying i ca n't go to the teacher . i want to get her some chocolate .
i know it is .
keep your chin up . remember ? nothing is impossible to a willing heart .
my mother is a bit sick .
it 's often windy in march . it 's always warm in april and may but it rains sometimes .
what ? i thought you liked patricia .
oh she is a beautiful girl . how old is she ?
mom it 's raining outside .
my mother is pretty good .
romantic ? i ca n't remember what that word means .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
yes it 's so cold .
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
i would rather be cold than hot .
of course i will .
oh yeah . i heard a little . by the way after the chinese had such a crush on someone 's song !
i can not wait to speak to you .
oh yeah . then i will arrange the concert .
oh it was my favorite . i ve always been interested in doing it .
do you have a favorite band ?
yes it is .
well first of all i need to make sure i do n't want to get a job so i can afford to go there .
what s the reason for the exam ?
i will try my best .
i 'm going to take a walk .
ok . talk to me about it .
i had to be there before .
is there anything i can do for you sir ?
well i ve been to yale there . i 'm going to be a major in the future .
where did you learn it ?
honey you are such an expert on your right . but you are the right person you are the only one who can do is a little bit of naughty boy .
can you tell me how to use it ?
then what ?
yes it deserves its name .
oh . you must have been carefully introducing flex time .
you can make it up by the end of the week .
sure . but you know that i ca n't read any chinese characters . what do they say ?
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
it 's interesting and i want to buy one home .
yes it deserves its name .
yes it deserves its name .
yes you 're right .
you would be very careful if you found him .
it 's interesting and i want to buy one home .
how do you spend your afternoons ?
you 're right . i 'll change it . please give me a call first .
yes i will be a manager .
what do you think i should do ?
wow ! that 's great ! so many people are very different from our school .
that 's great . so you can have a try .
do you want to know what the price is ?
i do n't think i can buy it for me .
can you tell me about it ?
what do you think i should do ?
can you teach me how to operate it ?
you can always ask around a roommate .
yes we do . they 're on the most exciting season .
oh dad look at the sign please !
they 're healthy .
all right !
would you like to register now ?
why ? i would never want to have a pet that would be like a rare occasion .
you ca n't say that .
you like panda express ?
i know . i intend to go to the store today .
you like the food there ?
yes i do . i think they are very informative . i think that we should go out as many people do .
toys ? why do you want to do something ?
no i haven t . i am still getting a lot of breath .
yes it is . look at this map of the city . you ca n't miss it .
can you tell me how to get to the jade buddha temple ?
you guys are working around the clock i know . that guy dave next to zina never leaves .
do you really think that there is something interesting ?
in my opinion it 's like this .
how long does it take ?
certainly . here you go .
well then where do we have to go ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i see . how do you feel about taking the subway ?
yes it is . look at the map of the lake . it 's famous for its building and paintings .
i 'm afraid you 've parked on a double yellow line sir .
i 'll pick you up at six thirty .
does that mean i should n't have any trouble with my boss .
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
i like all kinds of stuff . i admit i love romance .
i like horror movies . they re great .
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
yes . i think that 's because we have to stay in the movies .
well you just like horror movies .
that 's more than the number .
what a good idea !
you 're telling me .
here 's a notice to go .
you said it .
yeah oh my god ! it s still there . we have our first date right on there .
do you know what time it is ?
you seemed to be dull at that time .
at least more than 100 percent .
smile i can t believe this for it s been 20 years since we got married .
what 's the time ?
sure . it 's a pity that i can t wait to see it .
i am glad that you like it .
i wish it was n't so bad .
this is the best of our hotel !
what kind of food do you like ?
oh yeah ? i m very sorry about that .
you are so lucky . let me make a wish to try .
well i think i 'll try .
the <unk> is wonderful .
not at all . when you come to the party you pick up the party and that will not play with us .
my parents are taking me to dinner tonight .
it 's a quarter to twelve . let me see . . . you could n't get one by the window .
perfect . so you can see the name of the person with the card and then go over there .
is it very interesting ?
well that s probably true . but she s pretty .
i want to know more about her . how 's her taste ?
that 's what i did .
i 'm not sure but i think it must be directed by zhang you . that 's typical of him .
kobe ?
you are right . he is also an allright guy . i have to be his leading him .
that 's right . it was a very close game .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
there s so much i want to do . i ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . i just ran a search for music to download .
i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
thanks . that would be very helpful . i ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . there s too much information on the net .
when you sent your emails did you attach any files to them ?
yes i did . there s an antivirus programme with my email account that <unk> all attachments so i m sure i haven t sent anything nasty to anyone .
when you use the internet be careful not to give out your email address very often . if you do you might get a lot of <unk> email form companies trying to sell you things .
that s good advice . i should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself such as my password and credit car number .
that s right . another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time
how do i do that ?
take this web page for example . press the keys control and d together . click on favourites at the top of the screen . there you are . it has been added to you favourites list . if you click it you will
that s useful to know . thanks . i ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .
i 'm not sure .
i love being ! if i were famous i d do interviews for all the top magazines like cosmo and elle .
i wouldn t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice but it would get tedious after a while . imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you .
noone really believes gossip columnists .
i think you ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . you d also have to be very careful about every word you said . if you <unk> on a chat show and said something silly it
i think you re right about that . i d need a good manager to be my <unk> .
that s a great idea . which charities would you support ?
i have no idea .
you d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity so you d really need to be very careful . anyway i d be the first to buy your posters and i d attend your first book
thanks so much . i m sure it will sell well . i can t wait to read it .
yes it is . thanks . i m just surfing on the internet .
here ? in this cafe ? how can you do that ?
this cafe offers a wireless internet connection . that means i can get on the net for free while i m here . of course i have to buy a cup of coffee !
that s great . can you do it anywhere ?
no . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . there are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
so what programs do you have on your laptop ?
i ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs .
i know you are keen on photography . it s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone anywhere at a
i can get it anywhere . and i m ready to download both of them .
yes i do . i also use an antispyware program and a firewall . there are so many on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . you have to be very c
how often do you run your antivirus program ?
i usually run it every few days . it finds a virus about half the time .
which antivirus program would you recommend ?
have you tried this one ? it s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . you can also download updates for free .
that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ?
just a minute . . go to this one . i ll send you an email with the line in it . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the set up procedures . but they are not complicated .
what do you use your computer for ?
i use it for several the net word processing and creating presentations . i don t play many games on my computer but i do a lot of work with photographs . using a computer program you
yeah i can understand what you mean . i can download some programs and learn how to use them .
i use it almost every day but i usually only use it to check my email . i don t often surf the net . you use the internet a lot don t you ?
yes . i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . it can be frustrating when the connection is poor .
so you re online eight hours a day .
yes i like the job though . sometimes i help other people in the office if they re having trouble online .
how useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?
i think it s fairly useful but there are two big problems . first a lot of the information you find online is false . second when you buy something online you don t see it until you actually get it .
how do you solve the website problems when you re buying something online ?
what i do is find the website of shops . then someone from our company <unk> the shop and buys when they re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .
i d say the main reason is poverty . countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . if their neighbors have some resources they try to steal them by military force .
it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end .
how do you think they could be ended ?
i do n't think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . the thing is to find the real pro
so if the cause is poverty there should be a programme to make the country richer . if the problem is resources share them .
it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
yes . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .
the problem is that many poor people might suffer .
would you like to live in the country ? i m not sure i d like it .
i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that for me each advantage has its own disadvantage .
what do you mean ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
it s very quiet and peaceful . this morning i d hate to be in the future .
i m surprised to hear you say that . i think it s so beautiful . you must have been to the city for many people .
i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they re so much better to look at than concrete rows of parked cars and tall buildings .
i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . when the wind blows in the city you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .
the view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . there s so sign of pollution . the village looks so peaceful .
just remember that in that village there s nothing to do . there s not even a pub or restaurant . there s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .
you re right . i would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . i would hate living in the country !
i 'm not sure now . i think i need to learn something but i can t see that clearly .
i m a bit upset about this . i m so busy .
you know how hard it is to find a way to invest .
i do n't think so . but i think the idea of a movie as a friend of mine would be happy .
perhaps you can ask if there is anything wrong with it .
i understand . they are not actually one of the main things that you have to cut out .
like for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
when do you go to church ?
why not ! it s a classic in fact it s one of my favorite novels .
but it s so old .
don t judge a book by its cover . do you kwon what it s about ?
no not at all .
i 'll have to write you a ticket and suspend your driver 's license for 3 months .
i didn t realize it was a romance novel . what s the main ?
i m not sure . you haven t seen anything in the group .
why does he want to do that ?
he is too unpredictable . he says anything that pops into his head . and then he forgets it all .
won t they get his inheritance ?
no that s the problem . though they are welloff once he dies his house will go to his cousin . so when he dies the girls will have nothing .
i see . this sounds interesting ! maybe my teacher isn t so horrible after all .
so are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
i ca n't stand it . i 'm not sure what 's a good movie ?
that s probably because she wants you to read the book first .
it would take a lot less time .
how about this . when you finish the book . i ll get the movie and watch it with you .
is it ?
i only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . i don t think that tv is bad for kids . i think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes .
perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first .
if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch remember to have something else for them to do . if you don t they ll get bored and misbehave .
they could go out and play with their friends .
sure . you could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time .
perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . he watches too much tv too .
that s a good idea . remember that if the parents watch too much tv the kids will probably follow suit .
i like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . but i don t like traveling to work waiting for buses or . .
or getting stuck in traffic jams when you re driving .
exactly .
it 's gone with the wind .
why do you like it best ?
i think the reason is that i am going to be a little short all the time .
well . i like the thorn birds best .
is it very interesting ?
sure . i get a lot of information and make many friends .
if i have a chance i 'll enjoy the book .
okay . i 'm through .
that 's a good idea . let 's go !
it 's the best seller everyone 's been talking about for the last six months .
how in the world did you get a copy ? i 've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i 'm still waiting my turn .
i checked it out of the rental library . it only costs five cents a day .
is it really worth paying for ?
i ca n't tell yet . i have n't got beyond the first chapter .
if it 's any good i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
not a great deal .
i 've just been reading an article about them . they ll be used for all sorts of things now .
i 'm sure you 'll find it difficult to read report .
yes but they are used for other things too . do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to paris .
yes ?
could i have one more blanket ?
of course his machine must have been connected to a computer .
that 's right .
thanks . i 'm just glad that you 're enjoying your job .
i think you 're right . but what about the data i stored in the computer ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
you are right .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
no . they want you to send email to them by email but they can be lost .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
can you speak english fluently ? tell me about your english education .
oh what s he like ?
well he s got dark hair and brown eyes .
yes .
i 'm afraid you 've parked on a double yellow line sir .
where do you want it to be ?
yes but he s got a wife and 3 children as well .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .
what happened ? you look so pale .
it 's the end of the world for me .
what makes you say that ?
i do n't see anything wrong with what we 're doing ! that 's just the problem . in these kind of things the trouble does n't always appear at first .
oh that 's too bad . work harder next term .
b i 'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me .
do n't lose heart . everything will be fine .
right . i 'll do it for you at once . anything else ?
yes of course . this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
i m glad you re enjoying it .
thank you for the invitation .
it s my pleasure . can i get you another glass of champagne ?
yes please . thank you for everything .

i m sorry .
that s sounds great .

why not ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i m looking at my horoscope for this month ! my outlook is very positive . it says that i should take a vacation to someplace exotic and that i will have a passionate summer fling !
what are you talking about ? let me see that . . . what are <unk> ?
it s a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign . you have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . i was born on april 15th so i m an aries . when were you born ?
january 5th .
let s see . . . you re a capricorn . it says that you will be feeling stress at work but you could see new exciting developments in your love life . looks like we ll both have interesting summers !
that s bogus . i do n't feel any stress at work and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
no it s not your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . see ? it says that an aries is energetic and loves to socialize .
well you certainly match those criteria but they re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ?
a capricorn is <unk> and practical . she likes to do things in conventional ways . that sounds just like you !
ok ! how about <unk> ?
no no no a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . i m going to describe someone s face and you guess who it is !
ok !
what is the fare ?
our cousin pete ! my turn ! she has a nose <unk> eyes and a mole on her chin !
aunt rose ! that mole is so huge ! ok my turn . he has a crooked nose and full lips . he has quite a few freckles and an oval face . oh he is also bald !
your future husband !
not funny .
i m trying to learn new skills . it makes me more qualified for a good job .
mumm . no .
it s only the day when the world s biggest sporting event is kicking off .
what ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
i see . you re right . i m in the middle of my country !
this is bigger than the super bowl man ! teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that . they first start in a group stage with bigger groups each g
that sounds interesting .
are you kidding ? over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup ! it s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! each nation is cheering on their team hoping they will bec
what about a capricorn ? it seems that he has been <unk> for years and he has a great attitude and it s not very easy to play .
whatever i m going to go watch the opening match .
mine was ok except that no one in my class speaks english . i guess it will force me to <unk> in chinese more in class so at least i should improve a lot this semester .
that s both fortunate and unfortunate . it s the united nations in my class ! we have people from all over the world ! there are three germans a pole a scottish two french an american a brazilian
that s quite the array of nationalities . everyone in my class is from asia except me .
well i think you re pretty lucky actually . you know i have been thinking of going to the movie last time .
i guess so . i think i am going to be the source of the scholarship .
don t ! stay the course ! your spoken chinese will be eternally grateful . i bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice .
i highly doubt it . your girlfriend is chinese .
well there is that yes .
it s a good idea . this weather is so big . it s the weekend and looks like the in the middle of the city . i can t believe it s going to rain .
there we go . can you help me with the umbrella ? perfect .
ok kids here <unk> beach ball and a frisbee a pail and a shovel . i want to see an impressive <unk> by the time we leave . don t stray too far . wait ! leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes
and stay in the shallow area . i don t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! it s too deep out there and we didn t bring your .
you re right . i was really surprised to see a lot of historical figures . the salaries are beautiful .
what is that ? a jellyfish ? jeremy put that down right now ! it could sting you !
ah ! not on me ! ow !
i want to think of it for some time .
i wish i could stay here anymore .
what are you talking about ? how are you getting on with your boyfriend ?
well thank you for inviting me . i guess we ve really enjoyed having a big wedding ! would you like to try to get up ?
she is tall and slim .
oh yeah . i m really sorry about that .
sorry sir but we are having a sale now .
ok that s fine . i m free tomorrow afternoon . i can hardly get a rest at the moment .
yes it does look a bit sore . let s take your extra way of your chest and give you a few tests .
wow that s great . i m really happy with this !
ok . and keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over you 'll only have to cook that side lightly . put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the
i m afraid i have too busy to work at the moment . we ve got to clean up our own office and do we have enough time to have a big time .
i m afraid we can t do that . we don t have a very traditional contract for a partner and i think we ll be able to set up a business plan at the end of march .
you have to make a long face .
relax it was just a goat !
let me see . yeah ! we have everything on the back of my apartment .
you know i never saw a cooking show that i was so creative and just looking at it .
it s wonderful . is this your first time here ?
oh yeah . we had fun ! but you know all the time that we have agreed on it .
oh . . . well i m sure he will win .
i know ! it s just a piece of cake ! don t tell me .
fine ! i can t wait to see you ! what are you doing ? it s a good idea .
well i have n't been completely honest with me . i 've got to get some of my makeup bag .
i know you are right . i just love my new year and i really care for a new year .
that 's really a long way to my eyes .
no we did n't . we went to the stadium all to come to a park .
i don t know . i guess you re right .
what ? i read a book about it last week . now i read it .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
ben we re fifteen . what kind of job are you looking for ?
oh just for a position as a gas station attendant . you know starting at a simple lowly job just like all the greats before they made it big in the world .
uhhuh .
but i m just in it for the money right ? how else am i going to be able to afford to keep taking angela to the movies ? besides i love the smell of gasoline don t you ?
yeah ? you finally decided to wipe the slate clean ?
you got it ! i have a new job i m living in a new city with new friends ! this is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way i live my life .
so what are you going to do ? take up an art class or something ?
well first of all i ve decided to stop smoking . it s not that i m pinching pennies or anything it s just that i ve been smoking since i was sixteen and i think it s time to stop .
i m with you on that one . anything else you re planning on doing ?
one last thing i ve decided to come out of the closet .
it s about time !
now what s wrong ?
i will not run my car so it s because i m going to be here for a bit . i have to go for a while . i m gonna have to finish this !
what about the cinema ?
let s go check out a few things .
yeah you are right . well i m sure you re finished on them .
but you know i am thinking of someone else who would be willing to give me a break .
really ? you re so kind .
what kind of computer do you want ?
i would like to have a glass of beer .
so you also like coffee ?
i 'm going to the cinema dad .
i prefer wine .
i 'll take the shirt .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i 'd like to have a hamburger and a bottle of cocacola .
how much do you have ?
well what do you want to see ?
you 're welcome .
it 's been a long time has n't it ? how have you been ?
it 's really too late .
how are you ?
thanks .
i 'd like to .
i want to go to the lake . what do you want to do ?
what ?
i 've just come back from canada and we 've brought a few tickets .
i can . but i 'm not sure if i can .
that 's great . what 's the weather like in your country ?
i may just get a snickers .
i 'm sorry i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
you said it . let 's go .
you bet it !
do you want to go out and do something to eat ?
i think so .
yes a little breeze and a lovely moon .
what if we get on the bus can you stay and play ?
yes i find jogging does good to me so i keep on doing it .
you 've formed a sound habit .
i think so too .
it s necessary for me to do so . if we can make a decision by the end of the week i would like to rent a hotel ca n't we ?
why not ?
i do n't think we ll need more money .
hmm . . . you always do better in the morning .
well i would have preferred to do my work .
yes i see . but you are really busy right now . what is the finance department ?
well i would say it 's a little bit of a john s favorite movie . . .
that 's okay . i guess i could give you a ticket .
that s unless you got the phone .
i know you 're right but i really need to help you .
that 's true .
is there something wrong with your steak ?
yes you are right . we have a good reputation in the restaurant . but whatever there is nothing wrong with the food .
i think that the climbing will look great .
it 's gone with the wind .
and you like nba ?
he would say that he 's a typical show .
i have a little white wine .
sure i like hot food .
i started taking out as it a couple of days ago .
i have n't yet . can you recommend something ?
what 's wrong with the company ?
is there anything else that i can get for ?
hi john ! i have n't seen you for ages .
yeah i 've been out of town .
where were you ?
fine thank you .
well it 's not here . we are going to have you to wait for a second .
you are welcome .
very good sir . will you register please ?
good . i think i ll like it .
hey andrew . how 's everything with work ?
ok i guess . my boss has been on my back recently .
really ? what 's he been doing ?
you know just giving me lots to do . i 'm really busy right now .
are you ? what are you busy with ?
oh lots of things . mostly training new people .
yeah . i 've never seen a game before .
can you teach me how to play it ?
that 's a great idea .
you need to blow off some steam . the world is not on your shoulder .
it 's very kind of you .
i know . i ca n't do it . they need something to help them .
i just wanted to let you know what happened .
i was robbed this morning .
how about football ?
i promise . i will do my best .
i will try my best to be relaxed .
ok . i 'm really sorry .
yeah i think so . oh by the way i need to ask you something .
what 's that ?
well then there 's a central park . facing the park on fifth avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world .
sure . oh that reminds me . could i borrow your black leather boots ?
my boots ? er . . . sure ok .
i usually go to the coast . it 's always good to go to my own country . i usually go on my own .
really ? i m surprised .
i guess so . i think that is because it was wonderful . they had so much luck .
you 've got it .
well she s a postman .
that s what i ve heard .
well i m really jealous ! i won t be able to get any time off for at least another three or four months .
so many friends from england and might be a bit crazy .
george how can we ? vacations cost money . and this month we don t have much money left after paying the rent .
well lili we can visit different places in the state in our van . we are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . trust me it won t cost much .
where will we sleep then ?
in the van .
what about other expenses ?
let s see . gas food recreation we won t spend much . come on . don t hesitate . we need to get out of the house once in a while . we have been working hard haven t we ?
maybe you re right . when do you plan to go ?
it s definitely not too far from here . i can t wait to see what 's going to be like .
oh i don t know where we re going yet .
as long as we re going you can decide where to go . i trust your <unk> . i know you miss chinese food so we can eat at a chinese restaurant this time .
let s go to chicago . we can have lunch in chinatown . then we can go to a ball game at <unk> field !
oh you know what ? it s about time !
i found the ideal position . i m working for a plumbing company .
are you serious ? you studied mathematics at college for four years and now you have a job working with your hands !
plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge and creativity . i love this job .
i can see that . but i didn t know you had experience in that line of work .
i didn t but i applied for an apprenticeship and since i studied math and i have a good attitude 4 my application was accepted .
so would you like to be in a position with higher pay ?
what did you eat ?
i will call you when a computer is free .
the sunshine state is worth visiting . come down for a while . i ll play some golf .
do n't you like it ?
well we have to get a lot of exercise . i think that we should get that .
that s really a shame . we can not go to a game tomorrow .
i have many hobbies i like almost all kinds of sports and i also like to listen to pop songs .
i can t recall the games when the weather is playing .
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
of course . i just did n't know the meaning of the exam .
do you have any hobbies ?
i can take my bike .
do you often go to dancing ?
i know that he s going to be the next president .
i will . but the exercise is more important than the chinese .
palmistry ? what is that ?
it 's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future .
oh you mean palm reading . i 've seen that before but i do n't believe in it .
are you sure ? i 've read a lot about palmistry and i 've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . do you want me to take a look at your hand ?
really ? you 've read books about it ? ok then . but only if you want to .
ok let 's see well you 've got a long life line which is good and the love line is strong . . .
what else can i see ? will i be successful ? will i be successful ?
hmm hard to say wait yes it looks like you will do well in business and your ambition will help you a lot but . . .
what ? what is it ? what 's the matter ?
i 'm not sure . it could be the tires . let 's stop here .
oh i 'm not sure .
i like a 3 piece of cake .
i 'm a newspaper columnist . i write comments for a living .
you saw a ghost ? when ?
it was many years ago when i was a little child . it was the middle of the night and i went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . i walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs when . . .
so that 's where you saw the ghost ? in your house ? what did it look like ? was it hideous ?
it was a big green thing that looked like a person . it was in the kitchen and it slowly moved towards the stairs . . .
so what did you do ?
i hid so that it could n't see me . slowly it got closer and closer until . . .
until what ? what happened ? did you see it clearly ? did it attack you ?
it moved slowly up the stairs step by step and i could hear its approaching footsteps . when it finally got to the top of the stairs i realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . he had gone to get a late night snack .
i just found out that my husband is cheating on me .
you mean mark ? he seems like such an honest guy .
that 's what i thought . it seems that he 's been seeing someone else for about two months .
two months ? how did you find out ?
i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . i picked it up and a girl asked to talk to mark . she then asked if i was his sister and i said no i was his wife . she hung up immediately .
so you asked him about the girl who called ?
yeah he first said it was someone from work . he gave me a lame excuse and so i pressed him on it .
what 'd he do ?
he kept trying to make stupid excuses and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion .
oh no ! he 's all so talented . he 's all over the world .
yes he 's really outrageous . we 're going to have a birthday party this evening .
why would you say that ?
i feel that way too . but all in my life is a good idea to take a break at this time . so what would you like to do ?
sure .
so what ? i do n't think i am the teacher of the teacher . that 's why i can so .
you re a thief vicki . but i guess that s what i was going to do .
but that does n't help us to use the computer .
so what kind of sports do you think most ?
wow !
can you try a bit ? i mean if you don t have a problem with my hands you ve got to try and take a back class .
well i have to decide which one to keep and which one to choose . which one do you like best ?
cycling ? is n't a good idea to go to the beach on the weekend ?
nothing much .
i would love to . but i 'm afraid i would lose all the money for my family .
yeah i noticed that .
from the us to work the national day .
oh i 'm not sure .
well if you want to go to the park with me i can help you with the car .
i like the idea of the movie . and the director of my favorite movie is based in .
do n't be so sure . we 'd better make it a double room .
how do you pay for it ?
i 'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments .
tell me if you need help .
no i am not eating there anymore . i have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . the food served in the cafeteria is not my type . i am a total meat lover . but the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . they have been serving the chinese cabbage and
that s fine with me . i don t hate vegetables and i don t eat much during lunch .
well then the cafeteria suits you best . but anyway if you like to have a lunch outside the company feel free to join me anytime .
i 'm going to graduate this summer .
where are you going to work then in australia or back in china ?
i 'm going to the australia .
why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad .
well i think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment .
yeah i agree . the government is making money efficiently . it 's hard to deal with people who have been stolen .
of course ! it is the no . 1 <unk> in my life . you know job stress has become a very common problem these days . so we must learn to cope with it .
totally agree . what is your solution ?
well there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress both we and the companies should do something . for me i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know all work and no play make jack a dull boy .
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
but i don t think we can change our working condition . anyway we are not the bosses .
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them like <unk> deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
he did n't make any effort . his boss was always so nervous .
that is important . but what about the registration procedure ? it is very important to you .
yes they did . but they 're not very fashionable .
so you suppose you will have to pay a fine salary of interest right ?
what else should i do with all the tall buildings ?
it s ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .
i 'm glad you like it .
i left it as well .
really ?
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
bye !
sorry mum i guess i 'll ask my sister to come . i 'll have it tomorrow .
do i have to walk there ?
you should wear a tie to go with your suit .
it 's nice but tell me what you want .
i know . i think it s going to rain .
what functions does this watch have ?
it 's nothing .
i 'm afraid it 's too hard to wash off the stain .
you 're right .
i 'm serious .
all right . next time you will treat .
maybe we can try some .
what do you think of this one ? it 's a 16 pan .
you sure have a lot of friends .
i 'll take it .
when i go to the cafe 's house i am in a bad mood so i decided to give him some respect . the white wine will be fine .
i wonder if she would like it .
follow me into the kitchen . you will love it .
i could n't agree more . you know i could n't get used to it when i finish the work .
we will have a nurse 's eyes from his feet to even take a taxi .
do n't be so angry . i 'm always willing to help out .
i had my first cigarette when i was 17 .
sure that would be great .
i was in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked where is your home ?
oh that 's easy . she will make a date for the first time .
will you let me go if i tell you ?
ok . i 'm going to need you to turn the car off .
can i use my phone number ?
yes sir . i have added your address to the correct code .
oh ok . i am going to the mountains with my family this evening .
good idea .
i would n't mind a burger .
i 'm taking a burger with good friends .
sounds like a good idea . what do you think we should do ?
very funny . by the way what kind of girl are you doing there ?
yeah too cool . but what about some kind of sports ?
i certainly did . instead of walking . the sand storm gets into the house and was so crowded . i read the birds and the sunshine . . .
yes i 've seen her before .
then why do you want to sell it ?
i thought you were not good at the high jump !
have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
thanks that 's really a good idea .
not really . i thought i might be able to get into a hospital with a few things .
yes . i can try to not to let you know .
what dress do you think of it ?
sorry but he 's busy then too .
i hope that they will meet our deadline .
you must be really a good politician .
i like spring .
i prefer summer especially the summer evenings . when the sun comes down it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . after a rain shower the smell of the air is refreshing . it is also a best reason for icecream .
how do you get through the stuffy daytime ?
well i have to hide in the airconditioned rooms . anyway it is all worth just think about the cool evening time .
fantastic ! i enjoy especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad full of smoke and the music is too loud so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
how did you get that burn again ?
she left through a window that was open one night and never returned .
sounds cool ! but that is not what a lady should do . people are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk .
oh that sounds great !
but today is friday . you are not going to work overtime on friday evening are you ?
i know . but i want to know if my salary is not high enough .
yeah .
do you want me to put in a good word for you ?
our new president is john mccain .
what was the score ?
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
wonderful ! i have n't seen you for ages .
i 'm in a hurry . how did you do ?
i 've been fine but i 'm just fine . and you ?
quite well thank you .
i went to visit an uncle in san francisco .
better take the subway . it s faster and more convenient .
really ? i have to do it before 9 o 'clock .
well we have a rather comprehensive subway system here . you can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy .
where do we pay the fare ?
follow me please .
yeah i see .
cash credit card or debit card ?
go straight down this street to the traffic lights .
ok i see .
no you do n't have to .
i see . that 's so nice . can i use the black one ?
i am sorry you ca n't borrow a jacket and a tie .
then we 'll return to the hotel and come back will you change the appointment ?
certainly what time will you come back ?
hmm i guess on the 28th .
ok . five persons altogether please .
4 persons altogether .
i 'm afraid i have to leave . i have to be up early . can you go to the hotel room and buy the new house ?
er . . . hum . . . got it .
yes i did . but i heard that the manager had an article . they say that he was only wearing glasses .
right !
i think you should give it a try .
i see what you mean . that was pretty easy after all .
no . it 's all yours .
really ? did you see anyone come in for a little bit ?
no problem .
thank you .
i just lost my job . my boss just told me .
that 's unbelievable . why did this happen ?
i do n't know . i did n't think it was that interesting .
i cant't believe it . you 've worked here for years .
well it 's not here . we are going to have you to wait for a second .
you are welcome .
very good sir . will you register please ?
good . i think i ll like it .
a lot of things . i m working for a company .
oh that 's easy . if i give you a raise i 'll take you up on the spot .
why did you say that ? it 's a good thing for him to live with his son .
emm . . . yes . but i was n't too impressed . i found her a little stuck up .
you are kidding but she 's so helpful .
tom . . . . you are her boss you down . of course she 's helpful to you .
come on . she 's like that with everyone .
i do n't think so actually . she never even says hello to me .
thank you . but a number of things have been going wrong lately .
that 's too bad . what problems are you having .
oh the whole house needs repainting for starters . the carpet in the living room is worn out and i 'd like to put in new walltowall carpeting . last week i had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . anyway all par for the course when you own a house i guess . i think i am going to hire an interior <unk> to look the place over .
i 've studied home decoration as a hobby . could i make some suggestions ?
go right ahead .
well i was wondering what the salaries are like ? i mean . . are they much lower than the corporate world ?
that 's exactly what i did .
you are welcome jack . glad to be of help .
no i did n't . was it worth watching ?
i understand . why did you ask him to do such a thing ?
yes i did . the director of the movie was especially the director of the movie .
yes . he is an understanding of his behavior and the other way of their rights are lower than before .
hello ! is there anything i can do for you ?
please allow me to introduce myself . my name is tom .
pleased to meet you . my name is alice . did you just move in next door ?
yes i am .
no not really . when i left vietnam i came to america and i lived with a cousin in dallas for two years . where do you work alice ?
no not really . when i left vietnam i came to america and i lived with a cousin in dallas for two years . where do you work alice ?
i teach mathematics at a college . what do you do ?
i am an accountant at a company .
well tom . it 's good to meet you . i have to go now . i am teaching a class this evening and i need to get to the college .
it 's nice meeting you too alice .
see you around !
goodbye alice .
thank you . it 's a pleasure to meet you .
you 're welcome .
thank you they are beautiful .
well i know you 're right but you know it 's hard to give up an old habit .
i see . what is it ?
oh i see . so how did you ever do that ?
yes . what 's the problem ?
yes . it 's been raining a lot these days .
it is hard to say . i just can t wait to take a deep breath hold it and make up to my neck .
just tell me what you think .
yes here you are . these tablets are very effective .
okay . thank you .
how did the food be ?
thanks . i am glad that you like it .
i did n't sleep a wink last night .
did you have something on your mind ? you look so concerned ! maybe i can help you .
well i 'm under a lot of pressure . my boss is very pushy . he assigned me two projects . now the deadlines are near and i still have n't finish one of them .
is there anything i can do for you ?
yes . i would like to borrow these books .
i was wondering if you could ask me anything .
can you fill out the form ?
i think so .
can you wait a second ? i want some more .
just two weeks . i was in the car center .
all right !
so i must .
well suffer then . if you have a toothache you have to go to the dentist .
no we have n't . i 'm sorry .

my house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture .
no wonder you look so upset . have you called the police ?
yes i have . but i have to wait .
well i know that . but i 'd rather be honest if it 's not too heavy .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i wish it was n't too hot there too much time . the weather is so hot .
oh it 's too bad .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
that sounds great .
it 's beautiful . enjoy it while it lasts . it 's supposed to get cold tomorrow .

it 's going to be sunny tomorrow .
that does sound pretty .
i do n't care how i 'm going to pay for it .

yeah me too . it 's about time i made a move .
say hello to your friends for me .
likewise . see you later .
no thanks . bye .
it 's beethoven . do you like it ?
i think beethoven's music is incredible . i 've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent too . do you believe that ?
i do n't know about that but i do think that it helps people relax .
what other kind of music do you listen to ?
actually i mostly just listen classical music . what about you ?
to be honest i think classical music is too complicated for me .
what kind of music do you like best ?
i like pop music . do you ?
not really . i do n't think pop music has much depth .
i see what you mean . i think that 's way i like it so much .
how long have you been in to pop music then ?
i 've always been into it . have you always liked classical music ?
not really . when i was little we did n't really listen to music at all .
so how did you become interested in it ?
well when i was about 10 years old i started playing the piano . i think that 's how it all started .
do you still play piano ?
no i do n't like it dad .
what kind of movie is it ? i don t like many of his movies actually .
it s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead .
i like thrillers and i like julia roberts so it might be interesting . i read a review today and the critic didn t seem to be very impressed .
what did the critic say ?
he didn t say it was bad but he said that it wasn t as good as it could have been particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it .
the movie starts at eight o clock so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
is that right ? i did n't really know it .
i won t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . there were a few surprises .
i like to play basketball with a few people .
i like those kinds of programs too . they re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
i agree . people often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence .
yeah . and that s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !
right . you can t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . they need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs .
in my country there s a certain amount on the screen . i can see that .
that s great idea . but don t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?
no . they don t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ?
not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! that s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv where you pay a fixed amount each month .
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country but people don t seem to keen to pay for their tv programs . besides the <unk> channels offer a good range of programs .
well that s a good idea . watch where you can watch the tv .
it s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . i play the part of the detective . he has to catch the killer but there s very little evidence . it s a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes but i hope audience won t be too scared to go to the movie theatres !
i see . did you enjoy making the movie ?
i have had disagreement with every director . i ve worked with . we ve always in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . it was the same when i made this movie . i don t know where <unk> of my disagreement with rachel kelly come from . we got on very well and i hope to work with her again . i enjoyed making the movie very much . i enjoyed making the movie very much . i enjoyed making the movie very much .
you have been too busy to do so . if i were you i would have made the same suggestions . you should encourage the suggestions .
not at all . the feedback from audience has been great . i care about what they think more than what the critics think .
did you do you own stunts in the movie ?
i wanted to but my insurance company wouldn t let me . all of my stunts were done by a . as you know i used to do my own stunts but i ll leave that to the experts in future .
thank you very much for doing this interview .
my pleasure . have you seen the movie yet ?
yes . i have . i liked it very much . like you i was very impressed with rachel s performance in the movie . she s going to be a star .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
it 's really nice .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
oh i see .
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
yes i experienced one when i was in tokyo once . the tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over .
do you know where it measured on the richter scale ?
i do n't remember but it was n't very serious . have you ever been in an earthquake ?
no but i was in quite a few tornados when i was younger .
where are you from ?
i 'm from china .
did your house ever get damaged from the winds ?
most of the time we were lucky but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room .
wow that must have really been scary .
actually some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass .
where are you from ?
no but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
that sure did n't last long !
ok .
what happened to him ?
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
was it his first offence ?
unfortunately not . he was charged with a when he was in university .
but he retired that he would n't have so much money .
not much it was a minor offence back then . he got away with a fine of 500 .
did they take his license away ?
no they were really easy on him . the problem is that was a long time ago . they are much tougher on crime now .
what do you think will happen to him ?
well he 'll definitely lose his license pay a fine and maybe even spend some time in jail .
that does n't sound too promising . does he have a defence lawyer ?
not yet . if we ca n't find a lawyer for him then the state will appoint him with one .
my sister is a lawyer . i can ask her if she can help him .
that 'd be great ! i know he 'd appreciate your help .
i think housing is a big problem . there are thousands of homeless people on the streets .
how would you solve the problem ?
i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .
it would probably be very expensive .
i think the government can afford it . besides there are many advantages . homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement .
i think that the government should learn to discourage people from worrying about their parents . they would still like to have a difficult language like that .
if we are to invest more money to education we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn t be popular with voters .
most voters what everything bout ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things but without increasing taxes .
most voters what everything bout ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things but without increasing taxes .
yes . the government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money .
it was exciting .
i 'm not sure . i have it right here .
they are . they have a lot of metal machine machine machine around . let me take your measurements first .
we have no idea . let me see . . . yes here it is .
no . they are n't . in fact they are in a shop where they sell computer is <unk> .
i think i 'll try my best . in fact i am a junior now and it 's about six months 14 .
i do n't think so . i am thinking of something .
i thought i did bad . i 'm so excited .
it 's a shame . it was for my company .
i see . thank you so much .
because of the low size .
is it really amazing ?
because they 're dirty .
i 'll be coming along with my friends and play games and get a new one !
i was n't kidding . i thought i 'd be a little worried . but i was so tired .
well now we 're stuck . what can we do ?
yes . i 'm a little worried .
well is it your turn ?
yes . but there are only five of us .
how come ?
the rent is 1500 per month .
well how much is it ?
but i should have aced it . i mean i finished the paper so quickly thinking it 's a piece of cake . but when i knew my result i was like what ? that ca n't be true !
that 's my little money .
yes i think so .
what do you usually eat ?
i m going to stay at the department office .
that sounds nice . where did you go ?
yes . we have an english team as well .
i still get excited the day before .
of course we can .
i 'm going to buy some vegetable and you cook .
well maybe i 'm getting a little stuck . but . . .
it 's really nice of you .

what 's up ?

well then there are two of our business daughters . but as you can see each other has approved .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
i guess you 're right . i 'm thinking of making a party for my motherinlaw .
please accept this tip and label it .
well why do n't you go to the garage and check out the camping gear ?
good question . i 'd like to make a decision to be more excited about the future .
i think i 'm going to have to do well .
yes . we play every saturdays on sunday .
good question . i will ask you to give me a call as soon as possible .
sounds good . i 'll come back later .
i see . come on . what are they ? i 'd like to say she is .
i do n't know . i 'm going to be late .

i need to talk to them about the financial situation of the depend .
wow . that 's too much for me . do n't you have anything cheaper ?
ok . i guess i 'd better not have enough cash to buy some foreign currency .
i do n't know . i think we should go out to the summer palace .
please take the 6 aspirin .
i love this beautiful wood . it s a great picture of me .
another big step forward in saving on our own equipment i don t need a desktop anymore . a laptop is enough .
i m not sure but there is a lot of to be around here .
in other parts of the world especially in africa there is a problem with desertification . climate change and overfarming are causing farmland to turn into desert . in means that people cannot grow e

but you know it s a good book for you to spend the money in our country .
actually it s not to come to the end of this month . you should pay an appointment in less than 20 days .
it s too expensive .
yes i do . try to keep in mind .
i know . i do n't mind going out . i just need to get in shape and do n't want to get out of the winter .
oh does n't everyone ?
that 's what i 'm looking for . but i do n't know the sign of the contract . and i need to go .

they 're quite easy . may i take a picture with you ?
what kind of work are you interested in ?
i expect to work hard madam .

how do you normally handle criticism ?
that 's true . he gave me a good chance to have a try .
the <unk> is excellent . i will expecting you later .
not bad . at least i 'm having a big trouble .
that 's good . you can count on me in .
there are four people in my family .
what do your father do to live with the family ?
how so ? i did n't know that . i mean besides bask in the sun obviously .
i did n't take any time . i used to get a desk two years ago but now i have n't made up my mind . i could n't live without the public place .
i know loads of people who play it regularly . there are plenty of golf courses around the country . in the past only a tiny number of people played .
i don t know . what do you think ? this is a little box .
alright . let me show you some of our dvd players .
yes i do . i 've brought some friends and some of my old colleagues from abroad .
oh i see . you mean he is the guy who keeps the eye on the right side .
well i m living here . it s just my older stepbrother . i won t be able to afford to have enough time to get used to .
i thought it would be a good choice !
oh come on . look at this . it 's beautiful .
no . that 's not my problem .
oh she 's very similar to a really good one .
you 're right . i have to be waiting for her .
maybe you want to try her best to get her from the window !
well i guess we ll meet again and get together .
me too . i mean i get to her at all when she comes into the bar i saw that was with her in my eyes .
i might make nothing even if i stay . for a long time . but i really have to learn english .
now i can see that .
you can make it .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i 've never seen you so worked up . what did you do yesterday ?
that 's good . now try on this one . it 's not tall .
yes . it 's convenient and very popular now .
let 's see . if we have it it it should be over there under m . he looks through the cds . hmm it looks like we 've sold out of that one but we should be getting some more copies in soon . if you want we can order it for you .
i usually look at music and read or read it onto the internet . sometimes i chat about my friends i chat with my friends . sometimes i chat online shops and chat with my friends .
i can understand . it 's always the same with people . and anyway i can hardly even wait to get rid of the internet .
and it 's very fond of it .
that 's a good idea . if you want to join me i 'll be right over and see you tomorrow .
a lot of friends .
oh no ! it 's amazing how did you do this ?
if i were you i 'd apply for so much .
that 's true . but i know it may not be this kind of thing . i m really looking for it .
well it s almost noon . i m going to bed around two o 'clock .
what are they ?
i do n't know . it 's so noisy here .
have you updated your cv ?
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
yes we have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well .
yes . i 'm very excited about it .
thank you for your information . have you ever heard of our products ?
oh come on ! failure is the mother of success . i 'm glad to help you .
i 'm sorry to hear that . i think you should go to the gym . it 's been really cold .
thanks . see you later .
i like to play golf play badminton or crack jokes .
that s out of the question .
do n't be so modest . let 's go to the movie and have a look at the same time .
i love going to the movies .
i think it 's a great choice . i 'll take it .
do you think there 's too much violence in it ?
look at the rack to your right .
so how about this sunday ?
i like to walk as much as i can . i 'm a little tired .
me too . i love to read movies .
it 's in the cabinet . just take the elevator or the stairs .
why do n't you try looking at a new one ?
sure . it is a most popular dish .
that 's because he is so funny and i 'm not shy as he is .
sure . there s one on the corner of street .
is it a horror movie ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
hey how would you like to taste my fist ?
alright all joking aside what kinds of moves do you like ?
um let me see romance comedy . documentary action science fiction animated and so on .
that is to say you like all except for horror movies .
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
the notebook is this type of movie .
really ? i have n't heard of it .
well then this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . i bet you 'd love it .
ok . i ca n't wait to see it . let 's go !
i had a drop too much last night . i attended a banquet given by a chinese colleague of mine . and it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a chinese table .
you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or friends is a way of friendship especially in northern china .
i understand . and i look forward to seeing westminster abbey where many historic figures are buried like isaac newton the great mathematician and winston churchill the great wartime leader .
you are so oldfashioned . that 's the rule i want to do something about him .
oh no !
then he must be opening his heart to the friends . in a word as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort no one will at you .
i got you . next time . i 'll <unk> a toast with a statement like i ca n't drink any more and then drink anyway .
really ? where did you hear that ?
i met with the supervisor just this morning . i do n't know but i am a little worried . who do you think will get sacked ?
i 'm not sure . . well first it could n't be george . he is such a <unk> . he 'd wash the boss 's dog if he asked .
no it 's not going to be george . i do n't think it 's andy either . he is involved with the boss 's sister inlaw . and you know how whipped our boss is .
that 's true . what about lisa ? i bet there 's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
lisa ? no way . i 've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . you know rumors ca n't come out from nowhere .
well okay . then there is still michael . but he 's the boss pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . it definitely wo n't be michael .
no that would be crazy . but then who will it be ? oh dear it must be me . i should have known it ! why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . what should i do ? i 've got a family to support .
well i guess it is but i am getting used to it . i 'm so excited .
it 's very nice . i have n't heard live music in a while . this is fun .
well then may i invite you for the next dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
do n't worry . i 'm not much of a dancer myself .
you 're dancing so well .
you dance beautifully too .
when did you learn to dance ?
in college . but i do n't dance very often . what 's your favourite dance ?
i love rumba and waltz .
how about tango ?
oh i like it . it 's such a beautiful dance but i ca n't do it well . what about you ?
tango is my favorite . anything but <unk> or the foxtrot . the music has stopped
thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
yes it 's not like what the radio said at all .
i 'm glad to hear that . would you mind giving me a ticket and i 'll get it right away ?
it 's hard to say . i feel a little feverish .
it 's a little expensive .
you 're going to have to tell me what happened .
how 's the new product ?
me too . i love the fresh air when it rains .
you are kidding me ! why do n't you make a date again ?
i m working in a small company where i m at .
oh good . you 're going to the city are n't you ?
i m fine . are you busy now ?
i m sure we will . well can you come here tomorrow ? i need to cash some money .
how fast were you ?
i felt great . i 'm sorry .
it 's not so hot as in here . while i put on a hot day . anyway i know how to get a better one .
he got a <unk> . a perfect tie for a small plane from australia to africa !
that 's really a lot of nonsense .
i was so relieved . i passed the test but i didn t even notice it .
i see . but we need to talk with our manager .
yes that 's right . she had to get the job done by her every month . the manager had to get into the office and killing the business with us . she had to cancel the deadline . she had to cancel the deadline for the phone .
what did you think of it ?
well i 'm sure . . we are trying to give up our minds off .
well thank you again . i hope to see you again .
i do n't know . i think my neighbor would like it .
why ?
no i did n't . that 's the only thing i 'm interested in .
really ? i thought it was scary .
yes he 's got a <unk> hair and white eyes .
i do n't like the brown one . i 'd rather have a heavy ear for it .
maybe . but i m sorry .
yeah i am . i thought the same about this .
what would you like to drink ?
no the one you have on looks fabulous especially with your hair like that .
maybe . i 'm sorry . i 've been trying to call you back .
i am afraid i bought the dress at the moment .
it 's not a cut .
well there 's nothing much wrong with you . you 're under too much pressure .
i can understand what you mean . i would have to reschedule my for a long time . the boy after work day we ve got to get used to him .
sure . a ufo is just a space vehicle from another planet . if you think about it our space <unk> are ufos .
i 've never thought about it like that before .
i 've seen photos of ufos in america before but they 've all looked doctored up .
do you think that there 's life on other planets ?
i think there must be .
why is that ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
do you think that there 's intelligent life trying to contact us ?
no but we 're trying to contact them .
i suppose you 're right . i 'll have to meet her at the first sight .
i think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet <unk> will not become extinct .
do you really think that global warming wil destroy earth some day ?
there 's a lot of evidence that suggest it will but i do n't think it 's going to happen any time soon .
you came to the right store . we have new stock in the market .
france ? is he crazy ?
thanks . i appreciate the help .
i 'll call the police .
i ll say . thank you for your help .
yeah . i 've given him a chance to get away from work .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .

it 's really nice .

if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
oh i see .
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
let me see . that one goes for 17 .
would you take 12 ?
no i can t give it to you let you have it for 12 . how about 14 ?
13 . 50 ?
sorry 14 is the lowest i can go .
i know what you mean . i 'm like a yoyo .
i can help you with the looks at the new table . do you have the list of chicken ?
she s giving me a sick check and needs to be the best boards at the moment .
really ? then i guess i won t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
actually you might because there s a big convention in town this weekend .
i m not too worried about it . i always seem to find something .
let me check . oh ! it s at 325 .
wow that 's cutting it close ! that means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! what gate is it at ?
it 's at . . . gate 14 .
oh great ! that s at the other end of the terminal !
here s the application form and here s my visa !
be careful ! here you go !
i work in a publishing house . how about you ?
you can do without your help .
i m glad to hear that you finally found an apartment .
but i still love you .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
yes here you are .
wait a minute . i 'll check it out .
how about next time we meet at my place ? and i ll treat you to chinese food . i know how much you like it . we can order in and watch video too . anything you like i promise .
yes i had a great time . my parents will be there .
i would say that i was in a bit of a rush . i d have to work a lot of time in my family . i d like to be in a big family .
i have to get home before i leave .
well i came to know a girl 3 weeks ago and we have so much in common .
what is your parents living at home ?
whatever i 'm going to be a willing question .
what do you mean ?
i got a job offer from dell .
i should n't be scared .
i would like to stay there for about three years .
we must have some miserable time to get to the right bus .
no . but i 'm afraid i have n't made it for a long time .
how long has your sister lived in boston ?
yes my first marriage was a failure .
you are really lucky .
three years .
that 's a long way to go . it is so kind of you to help me .
he 's away on a business trip . he wo n't be back until some time next week .
i could help pay by rent this weekend .
there are four people in my family .
i have a large family . i have three older sisters my twin sister a younger brother and parents .
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
we are identical . i mean we look exactly the same but we are complete opposites when it comes to everything else .
interesting . it sounds like you might be a bit dehydrated . let me take your temperature .
no i 'd like to be there .
well i guess i could n't agree with you .
what about your stepbrother 's mother ? does he keep in touch with her ?
no she also died when my stepbrother was little . my mother and my stepfather met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . they ended up getting married a few years later .
sounds like it was meant to be .
yeah . let 's see . . . you know i was in a hurry but i forgot to put it on the spot .
i want to buy a magazine this morning .
well i guess people who lived out to me so far . and i really have to get to see another guy .
oh it 's fantastic . i like the course and the house .
he must be pretty shy .
she left through a window that was open one night and never returned .
who won the game ?
he 's got a perfect complexion .
ok ! i 'll call security .
he said he would n't stop having a dog so well .
he has promised her mother that she would be with her .
i think he 's got a message .
i was born in beijing but i spent most of my childhood in london .
oh well are you going to be home so we wish you were doing well this year ?
i had a pretty strict upbringing and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me .
well is this the right place to get ready for the new babies ?
no they live alone .
that 's exactly what we usually do .
i went to the university of ohio in america .
how long do you intend to stay there ?
i m a journalist . i write for china daily .
if you d like to . can i get you a little bit of money ?
well i did n't want to . i want to .
what s your pen name ?
it was a lot of hard work . . .
if you 're in love with me i 'll show you how to do that .
no i 'm just thinking of making a little .
i see . well i m still looking forward to hearing from you about this job .
my husband and i have thought about it but we ve decided not to have any . they are just too expensive . besides with all the news about global warming on the news lately who knows what kind of world we ll have in the future . what about you ?
i see . do you think they 'd agree with that in the workforce ?
for me growing up in a big family always made me for attention . i always wanted to be an only child so that i could always do what i wanted and so that i wouldn t ever have to share .
but it is said that many people like you .
no i 'd like to . thanks for the invitation .
but if a moment was trying to get killed i would have to say that again .
there are plenty of care for me . but i am really worried about how many people there have to figure out how much to pay for them .
i know . i figure as long as there 's nothing wrong why you 're so concerned . . .
i don t know what other people think but i for one envy only children !
that sounds great . i 'm absolutely starving ! what kind of food are you in the mood for ?
i 'd love something spicy . maybe we could get some sichuan hotpot .
you are a woman after my own heart . i do n't know many people who can handle spicy food . are you sure you are up for hot pot ?
you are so kind . i guess i am going to meet you at the airport to work . i 've really enjoyed it .
ok with me . you are the boss . i will meet you downstairs after work .
well let 's stop dragging our feet and find a sichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner !
i 'll try to think about it and make sure to be the restaurant again .
well . . . ? have you thought of it yet ?
no . . .
what did you do last night ?
that 's it ! that s the one i was thinking of ! i told you i 'd remember it !
you really did a fabulous job with a friend .
i think i 'm a bit oldfashioned . i 'd like to be a little bit of a challenge .
about 70 i think . this newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . it s a problem that will soon affect most of the world .
i heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .
perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
did she ? that s great . however if we have too many children that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .
i guess so . it 's about the food we should be able to get away from the problem .
oh he 's fine . kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays .
he would n't mind having the dog .
i had mine when i was 24 . that s a little young . i d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .
yes i think i 'll need more help .
oh is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in taiwan ?
yes there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out have fun and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discourage them but they don t often succeed .
i think you will find out if there are many fun people in america .
it s almost impossible to get the right balance . if you are too strict kids might ignore you . if you are too lenient they might go wild .
what did you argue about ?
he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back . he said he didn t have the money yet .
well he should pay you back . it s only fair .
yeah . i got a pay rise of 5 and a bonus for him .
did you lend him a lot of money ?
not much . i had to pay an unexpected bill so i needed the money back .
well talk to him about it next time you see him . he probably feels as bad about it as you do . close friends sometimes have disagreements . it s nothing unusual . neither of you said anything really nasty did you ?
i understand . we ll be glad to help you .
of course you should . you wouldn t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship would you ?
i m not sure . i guess i d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time .
what kind of people do you usually work on a team ?
i m sorry i m not going to be an engineer . i don t think you re right !
i would like that . i think i could have a look at it .
will you be there soon ?
i will . you call the interviewer and tell me your best in their business .
i am just taking a break from you know . that s why i am trying to quit smoking .
that 's true . i think i should have a try . in fact i do n't see what the picture of how others are .
there is about 18 people .
just make sure to put him in the nail polish or something .
i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
that seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .
that s what i thought . i just thought i d ask you and see what you thought of it . anyway what did you do yesterday evening ?
well it was a warm evening so i stretched my legs . i walked along the canal for a couple of miles . actually several other people had the same idea . i saw bill .
did you ? how is he these days ?
he seemed ok . we didn t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . we just at each other .
i see .
of course . what do you want to move first ?
let s move the sofa . can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? i ll lift this end . i want to move it sideways in that direction .
no not very much . he s too ambitious and dishonest .
i agree . i think the house is fantastic .
yes . they are completely different . paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother .
what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?
i think i 'm polite careful relaxed and shy .
oh i do n't think you 're shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party .
well . yes but those people always start talking to me . i never talk to them first . perhaps i 'm not as shy as i think . anyway you 're certainly not shy !
you 're right . i love going out and making new friends .
so you 'll be at my birthday party on friday ?
of course !
i wouldn t miss it for the world ! it s sure to be fun . she s invited a lot of people . do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ?
if everyone turned up it would be a squeeze but a few people said that they couldn t go so i think it should be ok ?
are you taking anything ?
i ve got her a birthday present and i ll take a bottle of wine too .
that s a good idea . she told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . i think it s going to be a noisy party . i hope her neighbours don t mind too much .
i heard that she had horrible sense of humor . i wonder if she and she was at her place . i heard she wanted to go to the cinema with her parents .
i see . did your parents get along with you ?
well don t be late . i ll see you on friday at helen s .
it 's a souvenir i bought you for . it really <unk> the couple .
i expected that something might get broken . that doesn t bother me . that spilled drink won t leave a stain will it ?
i doubt it i 'll deal with it right away . luckily it wasn t a glass of red wine i ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth .
i m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag .
afterwards we can do the washing up together . everything will be finished within an hour . your friend keith is really funny . i liked his magic tricks .
yes he s very good . . isn t he ? he told some funny stories too .
amanda told some very funny jokes . at the beginning of the party she was being very serious .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
what did you put in that punch ? it tasted great .
that s my little secret . did you like the snacks that i prepared ?
very much . the birthday cake was delicious wasn t it ? emily told me that she and karen made it themselves .
that cake tasted so good ! it disappeared within minutes so i think everyone liked it a lot . how s that stain ?
all cleaned up . are you ready to start on the washing up ?
well first of all it s much bigger . it has the same number of rooms but each room is larger . we also have a larger garden which our dog loves of course !
so it s a threebedrooms detached house ?
yes . one bedroom is for my wife and i . there s another for our daughter . my wife wants to use the third one as a guest room but i d like to make it into a study . our daughter is also keen on making it a study so that s probably what will happen .
what s the kitchen like ?
that s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . the kitchen and dining room are together . it s really large .
how much is the room ?
yes they are . that s very important to us . we like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . each room has large windows .
do you have a balcony ?
no we don t . we wish we had one . that s the only thing we wanted but don t have . the area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly .
you re right on the edge of the city aren t you ? there can t be much noise or traffic there . is it easy to get into city centre ?
it s a very quiet neighbourhood . there s some traffic but not much . it s not very difficult to get to the city centre but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ll get lost . so when are you going to drop by ?
she s my wife ! she s very feminine . . .
that s clever ! then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there s no chance of two people buying the same gift . what things were in the notebook ?
most of the things were household appliance . you know everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . i think it s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home .
so what did you get them ?
i bought a sewing machine . i know that my friend likes making her own clothes but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems .
what s wrong with it ?
i believe you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
household appliance don t seem to last for a long time nowadays .
i think it s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . because they know that we will buy the new models the appliances don t need to last more than five or ten years at most .
not really . i like looking on the internet at what s available but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i m buying before i pay for it . sometimes i ll look at something in a shop but later buy it online if it s cheaper . you don t like buying things online do you ?
perhaps you can find a new one for me .
not really . i know that it happens but if you buy from <unk> companies with secure websites you should be ok . even though i use online shopping facilities i don t think it s the best way to shop .
i m surprised to hear you say that . i thought you loved anything technological .
i do . i m a big fan of using new technology but i don t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . i think people need to get out and interact with other people .
so how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
sure . i d love to join you . can we stop by the computer store ? i just want to see if they have something .
sure . while you re in the computer store . i will visit the book store opposite . i like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting .
ok . i ve finished online . let s go . i ll just get some money and my credit card .
thanks for reminding me . i had forgotten to get mine .
ok .
well you have three hearts lucky in love tonight . dress up and go on a date !
yes . it 's really a beautiful day .
not too well ! i haven t seen you for ages . how about you ?
not bad thanks . but i 'm a bit tired .
i 've been having a big wedding for years .
ok please do n't worry about it . you 'll be fine .

oh yes . i 'm a little nervous . i ve got a lot of work to do .

i know . i feel a little tired .
i would love it if it was n't always so unpredictable .
i do n't think i will .

let me take a look . . . you know i think i d say that it 's a nice place .
i am sure it will be .
sure . but i think it 's too cold for me .
yes that would be very helpful .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
are you kidding ? it 's not fair .
you 're right . we do n't know what is going to be like tomorrow .
what 's the temperature today ?
i would love it if it was n't always so unpredictable .
i think that we can work out a lot of one day . that would help me to get better .
i 'm in a good mood today actually . how about you ?
i 'm a great dancer . i love your smith .
no problem .
i have been feeling great dr . smith .
yeah i 've been overseas so have you been busy lately ?

well in that case we can take you hang gliding with one of our experienced . it s the closest you can get to flying .
i m not sure that .
mmm . ok . well why don t you tell me a little bit more about what you would like ? we have everything from mountain biking to rock climbing to street .

have you updated your cv ?
i would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife .
very well we have a couple of different options such as beaches the wilderness the countryside or even going to a spa for the weekend .
i think something in the countryside would be nice .
perfect ! this package includes roundtrip flights to new hampshire . a free airport pick up is included . our vip limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger
sounds good ! what is the hotel that we will be staying at like ?
that is the best part . your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and to accommodate a maximum of that is guests . you will enjoy an and private time in this
sounds very good .
of course ! the hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail . you can also go fishing to the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard .
i m sold ! i want to book this trip . i don t care what it costs ! money is no object !
sure . we have 3 different types of room gas . the main thing is the same for you .
do you have a cold ?
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
i am in room .
and what s the rent ?
how much do you charge ?
don t mention it .
no that s right . it s a chinese restaurant .
great . i ll send the assistant to pick you up this week . and tomorrow we ll send you a detailed information about the floor .
we do n't have a swimming pool sir but we do have swim stations .
i think you should go to the movies this weekend . it s not good enough .
it s big and pretty .
i can t believe it either . do you have any suggestions ?
no i have no complaints . i hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company . is that true ?
there s no problem with it . we can t check it out . what s wrong with it ?
i am sorry i am too busy to be away .
you mean your friends ?
yes sir . what kind of room do you want ?
really ? let me go and check .
i see .
how long is it altogether ?
it s about six or seven miles . that s about the kilometers .
shall we have a rest here ?
right . then we turn left and walk up this small hill . the view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . we can eat a snack there .
then we will follow this path down the hill to the old church .
we can spend a few minutes looking around the church . then we turn right and walk along this path .
this path leads to the cave . can we look inside the cave ?
yes we can but it isn t very interesting .
then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path .
that s right .
i think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you .
i think it will take about four hours including breaks .
that s fine . are there along the way in case we get lost ?
yes .
yes i 've been to the states but i have been to take a job .
ok . i ve got it . great ! you can come back next week . we re going to have a lot of time .
what s your flight number ?
how about your experience ?
the most important thing i have learned was that i must continuously improve my abilities . advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success . if i want to make in marking in advertising industry i can t stop studying and creating .
now i have a seat . sir your computer is on the waiting list .
i think it 's too hard to tell but i know many people here who are trying to tell the truth .
i ll have to think about it .
do n't you think it 's too impolite to be a little absentminded ?
i 'm coming to confirm my ticket .
what kind of room would you like ma am ? we got single rooms double rooms standard rooms suites and deluxe suites .
i 'd like a suite with an ocean view please .
thank you .
my luggage is at the airport one by the corner .
how much is it ?
fine . i 'd like a night room please .
you are welcome .
ok .
yes here you go .
i 'd like to have some local specialties . would you recommend for me please ?
yes i d like to check three pieces .
i m sorry sir . airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage at twenty kilograms each plus one piece of carryon luggage . i will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase .
what ? why ! i am taking an intercontinental flight ! i m flying sixteen thousand cms ! how am i supposed to only take two twenty kilo bags ? that s absurd !
i am sorry sir there is nothing i can do . you cannot board the flight with that large bag either . carry on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat . that bag is clearly too big .
now i see . you charge next to nothing for an international ticket but when it comes to charging for any other small thing you charge an arm and a leg ! so tell me miss how much will i have to pay for all of this .
let s see . . . six hundred and twentyfive us dollars .
that s more than my roundtrip ticket !
is it far from here to the station ?
i agree . people are not driving on the plane .
yes it is . are you in a hurry sir ?
i am leaving on november 10th .
i still love you .
it 's really nice .
if you have n't worked out a production manager i would have to take a look at your manager .
of course . i always keep what i catch .
i m sorry to hear that . would you like to try it out ?
how much do you want to spend ?
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
what happened ?
would you like a shave ?
well would you like to leave a message ?
let me check sir . according to your file you watched titanic monday evening .
well the wrong information is in my file . i was at a concert monday night .
me too .
that 's all right .
i 'm missing you . if you can give me a call sometime next week i 'll be back soon .
you ca n't do that ! you ca n't charge me for a mistake that you made !
i 'm afraid not .
well i am afraid that is not the only way to go through the internet .
no i 'm ok . i 've had enough .
i 'm sorry i ca n't .
let me see . i think i could have the ensured five hundred dollars .
i like being with her .
well i 'll have to think about it . what do you have in mind ?
yeah i guess so .
that sounds great . probably we 'll go to that .
i do n't have your address .
do you know what kind of restaurant you want ?
i 'm not sure . i would like to have it all by tomorrow .
i like her idea . she is very short and slim . do you mind if she tell her then you 'll have some problems ?
yes but we ca n't have many orders made .
how about the historical club ?
yes that sounds like a winner . would you please call them to reserve a table ?
yes . my wife and i are coming to guangzhou on may 1st .
of course .
i want my change .
i 'm sorry . we 're currently out of filet mignon . may i suggest the porterhouse instead ?
well i prefer filet but porterhouse is good too .
and i 'll try my best to make a withdrawal .
normally i would take you up on that suggestion but just the champagne will do for tonight .
what can i help you with ?
that 'll be fine .
can i transfer it to my account ?
just plug the ethernet cable into your computer and a prompt will tell you the payment options .
well i see the cable . but my computer runs on wireless only .
well in that case i guess i did n't have to pay the fee .
yes please ! tell me about the alternatives .
first can i know something about your financial situations ?
great ! how much is it for a copy ?
it 's only thirty yuan .
i see . i will need a room april 14 for friday .
our stateoftheart computer lab is on the first floor .
great ! what if i need to print something in the lobby ?
yes i 'm sorry but you need to transfer to a credit card .
ok . would you like a chicken or a side drink ?
do you think i 'm going to get a concert tonight ?
of course . right now we 're in the middle of the prefer .
well i prefer filet but porterhouse is good too .
that 's fine . and may i suggest you order some beer ?

maybe you can help .
that 's fine .

ok .

i was in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked where is your home ?
if you had an baggage to carry it out in the bag you need to carry it .
yes i 've already got a current account and i 'm not sure how long it will take to my money .

i 'm afraid i ca n't . you know our prices are much too high . i 'm in such a short time .
you 're right i 'll try my best .
i get it now .
what would you consider your strengths ?
i will . thank you .
yes speaking .
i 'd like to discuss the new order with you . would you like to have lunch together at garden hotel next tuesday ?
well i 've got plenty of experience . i 'm looking for a more challenging position .
i see . if you have ever decided to pass this position i can say you have more questions while you are applying for another job .
so you have to open all the envelopes .
yes except the personal mail . and i also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the email box regularly .
do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
yes and i check all the emails for mr . thomas .
that 's where is it ?
i 'll be here to pick you up at 630 .
that would be great .
it 's nice of you to say so . please let me know where she goes .
i 'll call you later . bye .
yes .
i 'm sorry but 5 of these notes seem to be counterfeit . look at this watermark do you see it ?
it 's october the 1st our national day . i 'd like to talk some more but i 've got to get going now . it was nice talking to you though .
what specific places do you wish to visit ?
sounds like fun . may i ask you something ?
in about 2 o clock .
at nine sharp .
which class ?
you wo n't be late . it 's still early .
that 's right . it seems you 're right . we have the same meeting . we 're all going to get along .
how could the news get any worse ?
you deserve credit too .
no really . i can only hear a little accent .
i know that this job center is one of the largest and best in this field of business . i can do it well .
so you are really confident .
that 's very nice of you .
good morning mr . li
about 6 o 'clock .
what time ?
go back to sleep then but only five more minutes .
yes . i was almost an hour late .
that 's great . are you planning on immigrating to another country ?
i know . i will be coming to get a new apartment to pay for that .
that 's fine sir . may i have your name please ?
i am not feeling well .
ok i 'll not be there .
just point out to be punctual . you should face her when you talk with her .
that 's terrible . do you want to get a promotion ?
do you want to take them from the airport ?
you have a holiday here . you can get up free parking and enjoy the visit .
where is that ?
oh that s crazy !
first you need to sign up for a transfer .
well it 's a question of getting the basics .
please ask her to call john .
i will call the police .
personally i 'm afraid it 's too expensive for us . we 've got an offer which is more affordable prices .
that 's not bad . what about your understanding of our product ?
is n't it ?
what 's the prints about ?
no . they are n't . but they do n't . they cash only in credit cards and with credit cards .
but i still have a policy of paying according to the company so new employees get quite low salary no matter how excellent they have done .
yes . i think that is our proposal we can make it .
i see .
that 's right . i 've already been so here for almost an hour .
how much is it ?
very good .
i see . what other languages can you speak ?
there is nothing at the moment .
we 'd like to have a double room for the next monday .
ok i 'll take it . please wrap a few days later .
the pleasure is to meet you mr . zhang .
i do n't like coffee . i 'd like to have a glass of juice .
thank you for saying so .
wow . that 's really a long time . how long have you been with this company ?
i think the main idea is that we are responsible for all of our preparation work and quality . but if we do not have to sign a contract we 'll certainly try to do it .
you have competitors from south korea and other countries . at the beginning of our campaign there is sales resistance to overcome we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and tv programs . a 10 commission will not leave us much .
yes i think that i would like to have a chance to buy something for my own company .
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
we do n't get much rain in the winter . but you cannot take it any further than you may have .
the european market is not familiar with your products . you have competitors from japan and other continental countries . at the beginning of our campaign there is sales resistance to overcome we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and tv programs . a 10 commission will not leave us much .
that 's great ! i am glad to hear that we will have our advertising campaign . i can see what you have exactly done with the net .
well i 'll have to think about it and get back to you in about 30 minutes .
yeah that s right .
we usually get a 10 commission of the amount on each container . that s our bottom . right .

i could n't agree more . but we must get a 8 discount of 8 .
oh no . i m very busy now .
we have to make an offer of 100 boxes for the inspection . also any ideas that we should make a large order of the boxes to be delivered before shipment . the part of the loss is profitable .
i 'm afraid i ca n't do that . i 'll be studying hotel english in a minute . and i can take a test later .
it 's very kind of you .
could you also tell me your name address ?
let me see . laptop flash disk a ballpoint pen a pencil a notebook a pair of glasses cell phone charger moisture notion . . oh that is too much . you are not going to a business trip .
i guess i need all of them .

i know . but it is my lucky charm . i carry it all the time .
suit yourself . don t forget to set the alarm clock .
i don t mind if i smoke .

i 'm sorry . i thought you 'd be able to get a refund on time .
i 've finished the first draft but the professor said it 's poorly written . i have to <unk> it . it 's so depressing .
why did you say that ? it 's a good thing for him to live with his son .
i do n't know where i can get a promotion at first .
are there many promotion chances in your company ?
i 'll make sure he gets the message . you know he 's very good at the moment .

i 'd be glad to . but i have to . i 'm very busy at the moment .
no problem . we 'll have this house ready for you .
what about tomorrow morning ?
what 's the cost of the fine ?
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
we 'll contact you soon ted . thanks for coming in .
certainly . there 's a lot to be taken care of .
what kind of personality do you like ?
i was ok with me . i had to get a little of the time . and the work that was so important . i could get a little better place that was more than 100 .

i have just left school but i am well acquainted with office work .
what qualities would you expect of persons working as a team ?
i have a leaky pipe .
oh that 's all right . i need to get this picture of you . that is n't it ?
the room is a little too old . it is a bit of a hurry .
he 's the only one of the several to decide this .
that 's because you did well .
the problem is that i have a very good time . it was from the moment i got a report to the police station .
i see . but i do n't believe in all that .
which one interests you sir ?
well i am impressed by the performance of the american society . i am a student and have been in the past two years . and i am also in a field of interest where i can apply my knowledge .
and here 's my passport .
do you think that 's funny ?
he s been a very sad man .
of course he is . i 'll make sure he gets the message .
you can take the nail polish or you may feel it up like you 've got a headache .
but if you do n't have any questions later i will be right back .
i tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . however i began setting for myself .
very well sir . i 'll try that .
no thank you
well i love it . the room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . there are plants along the corridor . especially i got my own desk with computer and telephone . such a great place !
that s very good . i once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
what was so bad about it ?
i was a naughty boy and i played hooky . so the school gave me a punishment to clear the classroom for a week .
sounds bad ! lucky you ! you didn t take that job . i think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
totally agree . by the way the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . you can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .

well i hope you 'll have a good journey .
yes i can . i help you .
do you want me to give you a lift ?
yes do i need to do it ?
that 's right .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
no . they want you to send email to them by email but they can be lost .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
can you speak english fluently ? tell me about your english education .
yes i am sorry . i missed the bus .
but there 's a bus every ten minutes and you are over 1 hour late .
well i missed several buses .
how on earth can you miss several buses ?
i ah . . . i got have late .
oh come on gordon it 's the afternoon now . why were you late really ?

i 'm sorry that 's bad luck .
yes i found it again .

i was robbed this morning .
i am not convinced by your explanation .
this is brown speaking . i 'd like to speak to mr . tomas .
i 'm sorry mr . baker is not in . may i take a message ?
well what did he say ?
i 'm afraid not . he is away for the rest of the day .
what time will he be back ?
i 'm afraid not he has gone out of this town on business . may i take a message ?
yes can you please let me know i called and ask him to call me back as soon as he can ?
would you like to make another appointment ?
unfortunately i 'm leaving here unexpectedly and i may be away for several days .
i see . i 'll tell mr . tomas you 've called .
would you please let me know when you re free ?
what can i help you with ?
very well . i was wondering if you would like to come in for a little bit of a rush .
why ?
i think we can do that . it 's hard to believe it .
certainly it is .
yes . no thanks .
why ?
thank you for your advice . i 'll try my best to tell you that the answer .
we can try our best . maybe we can meet again sometime .
ok then keep up the good work . if you save more money we can pay you back .
you re welcome .
that 's what i 've been doing .
can you teach me how to use english ?
exactly .
is there anything you would like ?
i will . thanks for helping me .
i did n't hear you did n't expect to talk to the manager here .
well i can learn it very well .
it will be hard to get a car that i hope you ll have more time to travel .
if so we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks .
i mean what we need to do is to come into the meeting and talk about the contract ?
i think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . how about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ?
what are you going to do ?
i think to get the business done you should at least reduce the price by 20 .
i 'm not sure . you know we are trying to lower our price by ten percent . if we give you any discount on the high side i 'll order .
what would you suggest ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
thanks a lot .
very good . we will have to give you a discount if you order at least 15 or 3 .
certainly . mr . emory s at a moment . would you please let me have a look at your schedule ?
that 's a good idea .
good . we will discuss the matter again at the moment .
what time will the flight put me there ?
we would like to offer you our best price . let me check . the terms are firm out the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars .
what would you suggest to do with me ?
if that 's the case there 's not to be any reduction in the whole sky . let 's get a refund on the spot .
well let me see . how much does it cost ?
and how many accounts would you like to pay for these ?
ok . let me know if i can order my order right now .
i think the natural packing is very good . but we are not as good as we are responsible for them . we have to adjust the packing of the packing for ourselves .
of course . the brand is very good .
i hope to get there someday .
how about a game of bridge ?
we want to make sure that the product is high quality and we have the same for them .
i worked in a small company where produces several firms are .
well i think the color is too high for me . it 's a bit too small for me to buy a pair of goods . i 'll take it .
well i would need an idea of how large your order would be .
yes i 'd like to know how to make the decision .
that 's true . but i do n't mind giving them much freedom in the past . it is only about summer and it has a good deal .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you there .
he told me that i had a bad working with him . he and now i had a lot of bad time !
what happened ?
what do you think is the most important thing for him ?
poor man ! he must be very angry with himself !
i guess so . but i m not sure if it s not too difficult to get used to the job .
well but it 's too expensive for me . i am sure you will like it .
really ? it 's a good company .
it is so helpful to you .
you are welcome . i hope you can make it .
i think that 's my size .
what would you like to do ?
very good . we 'll discuss the contract immediately .
please accept my understanding .
are you interested in it ?
yes i have been thinking about it for quite a while . now i finally make up my mind to leave . i have given my resignation letter to our boss last friday .
ok did you find a new company ?
yes i will move on to xyz company .
good for you but your leaving will be a great loss to us . it is so nice to work with you .
thanks . i had learned so much from you and our colleagues .
i hope to do something about the job .
that s great .
i 'm a professional party this week and i do n't want to leave my own company that i have to pay for .
well i am not sure .
ok .
what 's the matter ?
it is ok with me . so i will be arriving at your office around two fifteen pm .
that 's exactly what i want .
what is the problem ?
my check for 100 bounced .
it is ok . you look really pale and red eyes . i suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest .
thank you very much . i am sure good rest will do indeed . i don t have this too often .
well it depends . if you would like to join us i can not have it right away .
actually it is my mother s wedding . my parents divorced many years ago . now she is ready to establish a new family . it is a special occasion . i ve got to be there right ?
yes you should be there . go find the manager and ask . i think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . don t forget to fill in the leave application form . it will be signed by the manager for approval .
thank you so much .
great ! i 'm sure you will be satisfied with our cooperation .
all right . please take a seat .
yes i do . i 'm sure my wife will be able to take a taxi .
i see . you must be very careful in what you most of our office furniture have exactly done in a lot of work .
i want to work in a restaurant .
can you tell me if the susan is available ?
i would like to make a call to australia .
ha i am flattered . actually when it comes to negotiate you don t need to like it . you just need to understand how it works .
i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice .
if i were you i would change the beginning . you should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities .
sounds easy . but how can i apply to practice ? i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . but i am afraid our boss will turn me down .
ok as john after kennedy put it let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate .
that is very encouraging news . i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . that is to say the r d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
it is not an easy job . how do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
that is very encouraging . but i am sure our target customers young people will love it .
certainly .
oh you are so efficient . i thought you might give it to me tomorrow . thanks .
you re welcome . you know these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . the more i think about it the more i hate myself for being so . i decided to change the situation as soon as possible . otherwise i will be more regretful later .
i see . what are you doing ?
the most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
sounds not bad ! better performance isn t just about doing a lot more . it is about focusing on the right things to do .
because you can find information on the internet and go to any place .
well thank you for your hospitality .
sure . it 's a bit of a minute .
that 's ok . how much do you want to spend ?
what 's your favorite color ?
what ?
thank you for your support .
thank you for your praise .
this is it ?
i 'm sure whatever you offer will be a fair amount for a person with my qualifications . salary is not the most important factor to me . i 'm looking for opportunity .
i m a student and i can get high marks in the past two years .
i ll be back to 5 o clock sharp .
ok ! do you take your bank card or bankbook with you ?
especially he needs to know their behavior their habits their way of life and the things they are used to .
we provide our retirement plan and medical insurance as well .
yes i do . what do you see as the future trends for the industry ?
yes we do .
then what is the earliest possible shipment ?
getting more start is 6 months salary .
i do n't think i can afford that .
okay mr . sandals . your reservation is in our computer . all we need now is a phone number .
right . how much do you charge ?
not really . but just started working as a trainee every day and an experienced company can be paid into your company .
is there any special ways of apartment ?
you re welcome .
yes i would be glad to do that .
what time would you like to take the test ?
i 'd like to send it to japan on october 12th and return on october 15th .
yes that 's all right .
please wake me up at 6 am .
which kind of internet do you want to get ?
i 'm sorry . i still have to go now .
i need help turning them on .
i know . but we need someone to do this to our work .
uh yes . you re in a bit of a hurry .
i do n't know what 's wrong with it . i thought i 'd try to get away from you . i was really under a lot of pressure .
well i have been up on a business trip and i am very sorry to have failed my exam .
i 'm afraid you 've parked on a double yellow line sir .
i m sure that you re right . i can t seem to find anything .
no you are just too <unk> to meet new people . we really are n't going to have to meet all of us .
what would you consider to be your greatest weakness ?
what are you going to do about the phone ?
in that case please be more comfortable !
i would n't worry about it . i 'm really tired of working .
yes i am <unk> about your advertisement for a sales manager in today s newspaper . is this position still open ?
yes but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?
yes i have a lot of previous experiences in sales . i worked in sales departments for two companies since i finished my university .
that sounds fine . please give me your name and phone numbers . i ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . it will most likely be in a couple of days . is it all right for you ?
yes my name is brian and my phone number is 5294870 .
thank you .
your major must be computer .
do you think my educational background suits this position ?
yes i m quite satisfied with your qualifications .
does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ?
generally speaking training new members is usually necessary . we offer our new employees a oneweek training course .
could you tell something about the job ?
yes of course . you will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints .
oh i see . i believe i can do the job well .
i also hope that it won t work . i can t finish that .
that s right . we ll finish them just in time . the macy project can wait for the time being . we need to spend several days on that project but it isn t due to be finished until the end of the month s
from next week on we should be in less of a rush .
i m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . everyone deserves it .
you ve made a good choice . this one is very nice . it s a best friend to play .
that s true . right . i m going back to the meeting . it s been going on for hours and there s no indication that it ll end soon .
carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is uptodate with their work .
good . i have to go right now . i really hope this meeting doesn t last too long .
they usually go on for ages .
i ll stop by if i have time later . make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines .
i will . enjoy your meeting !
not at all . go ahead .
well i was wondering what the salaries are like ? i mean . . are they much lower than the corporate world ?
not really so long as you follow all the regulations .
if you make mistakes in your job you 'll be fired . is that right ?
no . everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . the most important thing is to be responsible for your work .
working here involves a busy schedule and overtime . is that true ?
yes . that s true . we are always busy . the company attaches great importance to high efficiency . sometimes we have to work overtime but not always . and we have extra pay for extra work .
it seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as i expected . thank you for your help .
yes i heard that .
i m sure you ll find that one day . i m right now .
i m not sure . i d like to get a jar of strawberry shortcake and a spicy rum apple crisp .
what 's the advantage of this deal ?
and they have special projects now .
so how many weeks is the earliest possible time for the vacation ?
what else can we see ?
i see . ok then i ll get them ready for you at once .
it sounds like a really exciting city to live in .
well it 's an american company you know . i 'm afraid we ca n't save on this .
in what way do you intend to start on a date ?
it sounds like a good idea .
yes but have you made an appointment ahead ?
yes of course . i am monica . i have made an appointment with your hr manager .
just a minute please . i ll make a call to the hr office .
that s wonderful . i m going to do some shopping .
you re welcome .
you mean the network connection ?
yes i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . it took me almost one minute to open it . then there is no response for any click .
i have the same question . i can t send out mails . we d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately .
ok .
he sounds like a very good guy . he looks like the king in right now . . .
i did n't know you were spying on me !
i did n't know you liked birdwatching .
let 's see . . . you are importing fifty containers of textiles from china . they should be able to place your order before the end of next week . it will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of ningpo . the freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in los angeles approximately a month from today . domestic shipping will be your responsibility you can make
fine . we will handle domestic shipping but what about customs ? will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? i hope we do n't run into any problems with the border control .
no the chinese company has that all worked out . with the paperwork you receive with the shipment you should be good to go .
what about the numbers ?
can you speed up a bit ?
what about the memory of the old page ?
i think that there is something wrong with what i want to say . i 've never heard of that before .
i 'm afraid we ca n't drive on the safe side .
is that why you found this book ?
no . they 're just for sure !
we would like to have the best interest in our company .
why ?
you would n't do that . would you ?

well i do n't think so . but as far as i can remember we 've got to check some .
i do n't know . but may i ask what your phone number is ?
it 's horrible .
yes there would be many places in the city .
finally !
it seems we have experienced the chance to give you an edge and the general impression that the world has been affected by the buyer and the way to catch the product .
why not ?
it would n't be best if i had made up my mind . i wo n't keep you long .
well . you must know why he did n't come back to work so hard .
stop interrupting me . finally the ball flew through the air and knocked out willie 's school principal who was having a cup of coffee with mrs . fitzgerald .

i 'm afraid you 've parked on a double yellow line sir .
you are right . we can call the repairman to tell the truth .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . they think that is must be poor quality if it s that cheap .
yes . we have . the government has to cut down on the amount of money .
yes i called and they said they 'd go to paris .
at the hilton hotel ?
oh come on ! a that 's really exciting . let 's get on that .

no i did n't see it .
but i 'm afraid it 'll be too expensive for me . i 'm going to quit the job and i 've got to work tomorrow .
let me see . what 's this ?
what !
but that was how you see it .
let me ask the old woman in that reception office .
so i can see the key ?
you could have a try . you know what he is like ?
no we just moved in yesterday . i did n't know that you had split up . what did you do ?
which one is the best way to go ?
yeah !
i 'm not sure . i just feel like going to ask you something .
i have a meeting with my parents .
i got it . may i see it ?
do you need stamps ?
when the lower branches are removed you ll be able to sit under the tree .
well my company 's name is far away from work . they 're probably in a dorm room .
how long have you been like this ?
i do n't know . i do n't know . something rotten here ?
that 's still too expensive . aren t there any cheaper ones ?
i wish it would stay a little longer but i can t find my way to my place .
it s a program about . it s very interesting .
i didn t know that .
they are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . muslims call this pilgrimage haj .
why do they go there ?
muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .
when muslims pray they face towards mecca .
that s right . unfortunately so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .
i heard about that . the pilgrims must walk around a large sacred black stone .
that s right . that s when accidents often happen . the saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims to reduce the chances of accidents .
pilgrimages are common in many .
yes . in england christian pilgrims might go to canterbury and many christians go to the <unk> on pilgrimages .
isn t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?
i think that place is <unk> . there are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .
do you think that there is something magical about that place ?
personally . i think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that them . i don t think place is magical in any way .
no . is the second solar system .
are you going to have a hard time for a visit ?
it was a round day .
i was so angry that i could not keep cool . what i need is just an apology .
that 's a point . they might have to make the decision .
ok . what else ?
i will try to think about it .
i heard that the government might not be aware of their rights .
i 'm sorry . sir . it 's not allowed . but you have to pay in cash .
not good . it s a wonderful place to spend our time with .
i 'm doing great . may i have this dance with you ?
oh you do ?
i really want to get a costume and go to the university . can you get a grip on the bottom at the end ?
yes you have to pay the fee . that s the exact amount of the us .
i have done it in a while . we have been in the same position .
they must be very relieved .
yeah . if you want to see a few of the information that lists all of them .
i am glad i did n't realize that you would have so much to pay .
of course .
it was the only thing that i could do .
well i 'm sure he will say it as a suitable job .
thanks . did you leave the sample from the cleaners ?
you are so careless .
thank you very much . i won t let this promotion change me .
what do you want to do ?
you know i often overhear our neighbor the young couple fighting about how to raise their kid and i really do n't want kids to spoil our happiness .
most of them are office buildings huge department stores and hotels but some are just private homes . new york is one of the financial centers of the words so there is n't much business trip .
you will get what you pay for .
yes i was born on january 1st street .
i think it 's a letter from nyu .
i will be able to read the results on the website and understand them .
well it 's quite simple . just bring it over to the circulation desk and give it to you .
all right i will think about it . thank you very much .
we can keep the personnel market for you . it will take about four days .
so i can get a new job and have my license ?
we can give you the email address of the company and then come back .
did you get laid off ?
yes i did . it was very nice of you to say so . but i guess i could get back to you in a couple of minutes .
please send me your address .
yes i know . i will need to make a phone call and get it .
yes please .
yes my problem is to be clear enough to do anything during the first time .
sure . what s the time you check in ?
thank you very much .
yes you will get it .
certainly . as i can help you with that . we require the trading contract and also the vat invoice and the commodity delivery documents . they are likely to be in writing and the third bank so on to all of the terms .
i bought a sweater from your store a week ago . it says size 12 . but actually it is a size 10 . can i exchange it ?
thank you but i m going to put you in a really good frame as well .
yes i did . i also did n't like the job and the money i wanted to pay for my own .
cash or credit card ?
no i didn t . i started working here last week .
all right . i ll take it .
so i have to pay for it ?
i think that is an important thing to me . i really need to know more about this .
the rent is still included .
thanks . i ve been trying to get it done now . i m leaving soon .
you can call the office now .
thank you . i am going to get my license and my id card .
no problem .
i want to know if there is any information in it .
i will need you to stay another day .
that s true . i guess i will try my best to get to the money .
yes . we hope you will not get another chance of this .
of course not . just tell me your address .
that s what i need .
yeah the government really takes a bite doesn t it ?
i was thinking about seeing that one of my new apartment and the other day i wanted to buy .
that sounds like a good idea .
i received it last week . after i tried to repay it for the waiter but i am a bit nervous . i found it difficult to get used to it .
all right . so how about this work ?
can we start work tomorrow ?
that 's really a long time . how much did you get that job ?
no problem . what would you like to do ?
not at all . we want to rent the same at all .
you re right . i ve been thinking of you already . i m going out to the meeting for a few months until i can afford .
no i thought it was too hard to get a raise . i thought i 'd be a good manager .
it 's too late to see what you eat .
no i didn t . i started working here last week .
that 's true .
that s great . thank you very much .
i think that is going to be a very expensive problem .
er . . . i am sorry to hear that . can i call you back in 30 minutes ?
that would be great .
that s ok . i ll call you back later .
did you get laid off ?
yes i have been informed about it . here they are .
then i will send you your receipt to you .
no thank you . i m working on a lot of hard work .

hello ! i was exhausted some studying so i decided to read the newspaper to relax . unfortunately the news is so depressing . there has been another murder in the city center . i m shocked that the police haven t caught the killer yet .
people are starting to get frightened by it . everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .
you mean if they catch the murderer . i m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .
there must have been some good news in the newspaper . i can t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .
well there was one good piece of news . you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?
yes . her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
well they ve got the money and she s going tomorrow for treatment .
i m so happy for the family ! they must be very relieved and excited about that .
i m sure they are . oh and a local man won the lottery . i m so jealous ! i wish it were me ! i buy a lottery ticket every week and i m amazed that i haven t even won a small prize yet . it s so unfair !
don t be moody ! i hope you re not tired because we ve been invited to a party this evening . i know how excited you get about parties .
we have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . most people call them mp s .
each mp belongs to a political party right ?
almost all of them do . a few are independent . that means that they do not belong to a party . if one party more than half of the mp s . they form a government . that means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members .
what s a cabinet ?
this is a small group of 25 mp s who are usually <unk> . they make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
oh i see .
any mp can present a law to parliament . the proposed law is debated and voted on . if it is accepted it becomes law .
i suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
yes it does because they have most of the mp s . most mp s vote the way their party wants them to .
how do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
they produce . these documents which states their policies . some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters .
