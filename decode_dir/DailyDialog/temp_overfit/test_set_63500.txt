better take the subway . it 's faster and more convenient .
that 's right . will it take me straight there ?
we have a rather comprehensive subway system here . you can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy .

here you are .
you have to pay to use the copier .
just a trim vegetables for cooking . i will cut up the meat .
it 's worth it .
that s true . this month we re going to have to put a lot of weight in the air .
here you are . and we 'll bring our room with you .
it 's only a couple of minutes walk .
never mind . what 's the fare ?
what about this one ? it sells like hot cakes .
i prefer the blue one .
look ! there 's a folk concert tomorrow evening . do you want to go ?
i 'm sorry . i 'm the only one .
size five .
they 're on special this week . they 've been reduced to five dollars .
well i like the styte . i do n't think the color fits me . could you bring me a green one ?

ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
no . i have n't .

rhaki . do you want some ?
that 's great ! i will take it all !

that 's a good idea . let 's go !
the game he won a hard worker but he did n't .
really ? what kind of a picture of a picture of him ?
i wonder how long this weather can last .
sorry but he 's out of stock now .
when is he ?
it 's true sir .
oh forget to the food there is a supermarket not far from here . but there is also a small supermarket .
are they quiet ?
i think i have .
hmm . . . well i think you can make it .
how many pieces of baggage do you have ?
are there any parking lots for the tenants ?
oh yes . it 's one . a taxi will be here in just a minute .
here you are . i have to go to the front of the plane .
the one next to the teachers union .
so you 're afraid of your way to go to america ?
how many pieces of baggage do you have ?
oh no .
i think that is a really complicated way of coffee .
the tv news does n't tell us the race anymore .
oh ok .
but we need to go back to our dorm .
i think that would be nice .
my mom just wants everything to be perfect for us .
no problem . but it 's the problem .
no . i want to sit on the grass .
surely of course . is this the director of the <unk> ?
what 's the price ? it 's just a little expensive .
what are the hours of online ?
a difference . i gave you a big bonus for that .
you said you were only going to window shop !
she 's only 29 . 95 .
what is that the place ? it 's so we have to wait for the last two weeks .
what would it be like to do with all the people ?
good luck . it 's a lovely neighborhood .
yes . when did you get back ?
cool down harry ! what are you really mad about ? did you get ripped off ?
yes . last sunday i went to a nearby market . it was on <unk> fair . i chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot without even trying to strike a bargain . i paid one hundred and twenty . and just
is that so ? i 'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . it 's the norm of free trade . the seller sets
but do n't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?
of course that 's something really irritation . and the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . i recommend you to consult the price tags in the superb
that 's fine . i 'll be waiting for you .
i know . i know . i 'm not going to get up in the morning .
you need to provide some of the transportation .
you need to go to the bank again .
yes i 'm not .
i go to bed at ten and get up at six .
that 's helpful for your health .
but english is good for me . it 's a young man .
yes i am . i 'm studying chinese now .
really ? does that mean ?
what did you do last night ?
i 'd better not .
yes i see . thanks a lot . bye !
ok . we will take care of it .
hold on please .
yes please tell her that band practice has been moved to tuesday night at eight thirty .
thanks . see you later .
it 's 42 ! that 's expensive !
and here are the money .
here you are . i 'm going to give you the next size up .
i would enjoy my meal then .
this is supposed to be your vacation we 'd like you to just relax .
cooking makes me feel relaxed . so what are we cooking ?
ok well we 're going to make a pan of lasagne a salad and some garlic bread . here 's the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?
sure . we should probably preheat the oven right away too .
that 's a good idea . can you set the oven to 200 degrees celsius ?
that 's a bit high for lasagne . i 'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there .
fine . i 'll just get out the casserole dish the <unk> the <unk> the salad bowl and the baking sheet .
you know i could do this myself . why do n't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ?
i do n't think it 's broken .
well if it 's not broken then you need to learn how to vacuum better because it does n't look like you 've vacuumed for ages !
fine . i 'll go vacuum . let me know if you need any other help .
yes of course . turn right at the traffic light and you 'll see it .
will you let me know where to get off ?
it 's on the fourth floor . turn left when you leave the hotel and you 'll see it on your left .
please get the call from the doctor .
yes . i 'll give you a call in the taxi .
i guess i could give you some advice .
about ten minutes .
could you please tell me when we get there ?
you re welcome . feel free to ask me any time you need help .
of course . is the dinner still on ?
yes i was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .
we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .
that 's what i thought you would do . listen i live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . it 's just down the street from all the bars . you probably do n't want to be walking around after dark .
it ca n't be that bad .
but it is ! take this morning for example . the subway was so packed this morning i got totally squished by about a hundred busy <unk> on the way to work .
really ? i never would have guessed . the criminals must only come out in the evenings because i 've never noticed anything strange when i 've been at your house in the daytime .
do me a favor and take a taxi . it 'd make me feel a lot better .
ok we will . how do you get around in the evenings ?
when i first moved in i walked everywhere . but within a week i had my purse stolen just a block away from the police station ! now i always take public transportation .
no wonder you are completely transform your pressure right ?
nothing else has happened to me but i have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close .
well we 'll be careful . thanks for letting me know .
well it s not that rush . it s about to you .
are there many accidents in the city every day ?
but the rush is terrible . it is against the labor law .
what are your salary expectations ?
any rain ?
i think it s too cold .
it 's my pleasure . i am very sorry for you .
my colleagues quickly get promotions while i always get sidelined . i do n't know what to do anymore .
i am preparing a birthday party for julia . i really don t want to see you here .
not now . i 'll take them all .
that s too bad . this is terrible .
two people were injured .
that 's too bad . do n't worry .
i 'm sorry but the number of the problems is n't it ?
i think they 're trying to drive a little more sensitive and fall .
we are in common .
no reservation is n't .
where to ?
yes of course . and there is a change in the next room .
excuse me what kind of dessert do you want ?
i 'm sorry but i can t . it 's my fault .
oh i 'm afraid we will have to wait .
no problem . do n't worry the taxi is faster than the bus .
i 'm afraid we ca n't .
you know i hate shopping more than anything else in this world .
we could get some exercise in and we could get some errands run too .
what kind of errands do we need to run ?
well we could go to the newsagent s to pick up the sunday paper go to the butcher s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner and to the chemist s to pick up your prescription from the doctor .
i 'll only go if we can stop at the <unk> to pick up something to drink for tonight .
ok .
sounds good .
i promise . we re only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven t had time for .
ok let s go then !
i ca n't imagine . . .
well we offer a 1 each month paid vacation .
i need to pay my bills .
you said you were only going to window shop !
i agreed to not go into the mall but i can still look at things in the market !
i should have known . . .

<unk>
okay . please arrive at seven fortyfive . we can only hold the room until 815 .
hi provides some kind of l c .
how much do you need ?
i am on route 80 a few miles east of the university of utah .
why would you like to work with us ?
it is a new car . i 'm glad to hear it .
i m sorry . we do n't haven any .
i think i 'll have the lobster . what would you like to have ?
ok . but what 's the rate today ?
what do you have in mind ?
hi mary .
i 'm sorry . mr . li is in a meeting right now . can i take a message ?
thank you . mr . smith . what can i do for you ?
yes we do . but you must pay a dime which is expensive to be valid for three days .
ok . thank you .
because i m not in the mood that s why .
well don t just sit there do something . come and help me in the kitchen .
help you in the kitchen i don t feel like it .
i know . i didn t feel like sitting in the kitchen and the bathroom .
really ? do i have to do it ?
not if you don t want to .
really it 's so beautiful .
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
you must n't pick it in this place .
yes i 'm really looking forward to it .
it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
yes ?
i bought one size up by mistake .
i do n't have an excuse madam .
i feel they 're dirty .
i 'm sorry .
it says zina 's fault . why do n't you go and see her ?
sorry i 'm very near sighted .
i know . i am already gone to this horrible weather .
thank you very much . here 's your bill .
sorry to say it was not on the way but i had no idea it was all right .
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials ignite it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .
i am not surprised you eat too much .
and i suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office does n't help .
no i would n't think so .
i do wish i could lose weight .
well why do n't you go on the diet ?
i 've tried diets before but they 've never worked .
perhaps you should exercise more . why do n't you go to an exercise class ?
yes maybe i should .
that is just an excuse . you can always find some time to exercise .
but i work hard all the time for long hours . often i have no time for lunch . yet i am still getting fatter .
bill you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . and skipping meals will not help you lose weight . in fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals .
i know you 're right but what can i do ?
how about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ?
but i 'll miss the news . it s important in my business to keep up with events in china .
i know i know . have you got a portable radio ? you can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time .
that 's a good idea !
they look delicious . you can have all of the time you eat and a lot of makeup .
look . here are the core classes . everyone has to take them .
i also want to check the kitchen .
i suggest some beef .
no not at all . the examples are really conservative .
okay . let me see .
sure . what time ?
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
well i swim and run every day .
now tell me what do you eat ?
well i do n't eat any meat but i do eat fish and eggs .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
oh yes and fruits . i love fruits very much .
what do you drink ?
well i never drink alcohol coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
what do you drink ?
you too . have you lost some weight ?
yes i took off 4 kilos . i am glad you notice it .
not some crazy diet fat i hope .
and i never believe how much of an young man after 10 years ago .
sounds reasonable .
ah yes this is just what i was looking for .
ah yes this is in emergency .
ah that 's just the number .
i don t have a list of employment contract but i don t have a list of employment contract . i think the main thing is to do is fill in the form and you can ask for a few hours .
this friday i m sorry .
no thanks . i have had enough .
actually you have n't have much .
to tell you the truth i am on the diet .
that sounds ridiculous . why ?
well i am gaining weight these days and i have to watch my calories .
get in the front .
you are not really chubby . you are actually thin enough .
i do n't think so . i know i 've put on weight this winter .
so you are watching your weight are n't you ?
yes to tell you the truth . i am on the diet .
where are you heading now ?
i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road . it is very close to your house .
is that the university next to the teachers college ?
that 's the one .
you mean we 'll share the taxi ?
yeah . if we share the cab it 'll be cheaper . besides that your chinese is better than mine . the drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though i practice my pronunciation carefully .
well . do n't worry about it i will be happy to share the taxi with you .
take me to the airport please .
are you in a hurry ?
you bet . i was supposed to call my mother an hour ago .
i think we 'll have this one .

i appreciate you very much .

ok . there is a lot of to be taken care of .
i want to mail this package .
it 's a deal .
i see . well can i have a look at your phone ? unfortunately this phone can t be used in the us it s not compatible with our 3g network .
what ? really ? i don t really want to have to buy a new phone .
well you re in luck ! you see if you sign up for our threeyear plan we ll throw in a handset for free .
really ? what s the catch ?
there s no catch ! you just choose a plan sign a threeyear contract and that s it ! actually we re running a special promotion right now and we re giving away a blackberry curve with our special mega value forty dollar plan .
so what does this plan include ?
well you get nine hundred anytime minutes and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other <unk> clients one thousand text messages per month and unlimited evening and weekend minutes . oh and we also offer a rollover option .
wow all this for forty dollars per month ?
that s right plus the activation fee the emergency services fee the monthly service fee the emergency services fee the emergency services fee and any charges for extra minutes and . . .

and about time too !
ok . i ll stay home after work .
come on . i wouldn t even forget it . you were such a wimp !
what 's it look like lady ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in is n't it ?
mom the one with honey !
that 's too bad .
i got off at the last stop and i 'll be back in about half an hour .
thank you for returning my call .
don t worry . it s a good habit .
we just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything . we have termites in the wood cockroaches all over the place and last night i saw a huge rat out in the backyard !
well there s nothing we can t handle . i ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches but the termites will be harder to get rid of . we will have to cover the entire house and <unk> it . unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days .
no problem just get the money !
morning michael . i ve been very busy lately . one of our other vendors is going out of business and i ve been searching for a suitable replacement .
well rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run please sit down . coffee ?
no i was n't . i came to a bar and worked for a while . the first thing i did n't want to do is to is listen to . i was n't aware of all the power that there is a terrible customer here .
haha i could never do that . i d be a zombie if i didn t have my morning coffee fix . let s get down to business then .
yes . i ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . the demand for phone cameras is growing and pear has been falling behind in the market .
that s great ! i m glad to hear that pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . is pear still interested in having those ?
no we re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . we were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
surely . let s get started by drafting a new contract .
sure what kind of shoe are you looking for ? we ve got <unk> sandals sleek high heels edgy pumps or if you re looking for something a little more practical we ve got mary janes ballerinas .
show me some classic high heels please .
ok right this way . what color did you have in mind ?
black . classic .
of course . we ve got this style here that is very popular . because it s an opentoe shoe you can wear it any time of the year . they look great on everyone .
umm . too shiny . and i wear pantyhose with my shoes so let s look for a <unk> shoe .
ok these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a twoinch heel so they are very comfortable .
i don t like the pointed toes . let me take a look at what else you have . too high . that one looks like the back would cut into my heel . i have a high instep so i doubt that one will fit properly . i don t want bows . those might as well be stilettos . ah finally this is what i m looking for .
let me see . all right . i ll send a short message and a paper .
medium please .
ok you will be hearing from mr wood later in the afternoon then mr john .
hmmm . not good . they re too tight . the length is right but the shoe is too narrow and it s pinching my toes . and there d be no room for my <unk> . you know what ? i don t think i have the patience for this today . i have the patience for this today . they just don t make shoes like they used
have a nice day ma am .
why not ? come on ! just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
i will ! i ll feed it bathe it and walk it every day ! we can get a <unk> or a german <unk> !
what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus our apartment is too small for that <unk> of dog .
ok . how about we get a cat or a <unk> ?
we re planning on having children soon i don t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
fine ! let s get a bird then ! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! a parrot would be awesome !
i ll tell you what i can get you some hamsters and we ll take it from there .
<unk> !
well since we are getting up so late i decided to make a big breakfast !
nice ! brunch !
kind of so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
wow ! you really went all out ! did you make any coffee ?
yeah just the way you like it ! i also put out some cereal and <unk> if you feel like having something more light .
looks good ! i ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
get the jam and butter while you are in there ! oh ! and don t forget the syrup !
what ? you don t know the first thing about gardening !
on the contrary i have been reading a lot of books about the subject .
oh yeah ? tell me then smarty pants how will you go about setting up your garden ?
well first i need to buy some things such as fertilizer seeds and tools .
what type of tools ?
you know the basics . a rake shovel spade and a hoe .
right . well it seems like you have all your bases covered . what s next ?
i ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . i ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! gardening all done !
well good luck with your garden especially considering we are in the dry season and it won t rain for the next three months !
no thank you i am not interested .
please ma am if you could spare five minutes of your time i am sure we could find something that interests you !
i wish i could but i have to walk the dog and finish cooking so if you would excuse me .
we have a great variety of magazines all about cooking ! this one for example is a bi monthly publication with recipes from all over the world !
wow that would be kind of useful do you have any other cooking magazines ?
sure do ! this one is a quarterly publication but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas !
wow this is nice ! ok sign me up for both publications .
you mentioned you have a dog most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care pet shops and even pet sitters !
that is exactly what i needed ! what else do you have ?
well i also have . . .
i m sorry . you know i m supposed to have an appointment .
oh i see . ok i 'll go get the pair . oh dear ! what did you do ?
that 's true .
she ll be a good mother . she s a real <unk> .
i ll try my best to make a good impression . how about your company ?
pretty good thanks . you 've just had a really good cold .
how are you finding your new boss ?
i would like to transfer some money .
i will be happy to see you this afternoon .
i expected too much from the rent to the apartment .
i feel they 're dirty .
i do n't understand why i need to make an appointment .
when can you come in ?
we 're only available at 3
well we can still do some shopping .
thanks for understanding .
i m working here today .
good then let s get to the interview .
i need to cancel an account .
i will be happy to help you . may i have your name please ?

i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
that would be great .
how does friday sound ?
yes that 's perfect . what 's your job going on ?
i m sorry but that will be too late .
ok . see you tomorrow .
i am the apartment manager . how can i help you ?
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
oh really ? where d you find it ?
i 'd love to ! but i am afraid i 'll have to .
come on . that 's no reason to do something . i will send you a sample . have you any particular size you want ?
good . i 'll have to go .
we 'll call you so we can set up an appointment for you .
i think i know where it is .
do you want to work late ?
i 'm finished .
yes . that 's all you need to do .
i have a master bedroom with a few newspapers near the university .
you think that s a good idea .
i think there s not much news .
yes it will be the best ski trip i 've ever had .
well off the record of course but i hear that he 's got terrible debts . he has his own company and it 's not going very well .
i see . would you mind telling me if i had a home ?
your new apartment can be <unk> and repainted by next month .
i sure do .
we 're going to do something about it .
oh really ? what are you going to do about it ?
do you want to get them from here ?
i like it but there is one problem .
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
the bathtub barely <unk> at all .
that 's a relief ! i was a little worried about it i left england in a bit of a hurry .
i went sailing fishing and horseback riding .
i was worried about that . i would appreciate it if that .
i will . and could you tell me how much i will pay for it ?
where s your polling place ?
we have a few problems in our office and our boss took it for the next two weeks . we 're having a long time to make sure that we can work together .
yes it s a nice place .
say how would you like to be a dress designer ?
i 'm pretty good . i 'm just glad i finally finally got back .
your dress is really nice .
i would like to get a hamburger and a cup of coffee .
i thought it would be .
oh i hope so .
the balcony is absolutely delicious .
i ll be happy to rent the apartment right now .
when are you available ?
that would be great .
do you want to have lunch with me ?
one more second sir . your reservation is now verified so all i need is your phone number .
i 'd like to but my apartment is on the top of it .
i m glad to hear that .
just get over here !
oh that 's great . where would you like to go ?
my check for 100 bounced .
when can i start moving in ?
your new apartment can be <unk> and repainted by next month .
you should check the connections .
sir you 'll find our company and delivery by the end of this month . in that case we 'll have to pay for the whole bill .
oh really ? what are you going to do now ?
i m glad to hear that .
i m happy to hear you say that .
what are your plans now that you re getting out ?
the rent is 1500 per month .
that s way too much .
that s what my husband said .
yes i was . but i 'm not sure what 's on the price .
all right . how much do you want to pay ?
that s expensive but it can t be that expensive .
how much more ?
that 's too late .
okay mr . horn see you tomorrow at 1030 .
i think first of all i am going to do is fill in the details .
i had a home inspection before but didn t really understand it .
i think that the owners should be able to fix the problems before you move in .
it s not like that . we ll just fix it right away .
the owners may wish to pay to have the problems fixed or maybe the price of the house can be reduced .
i think it s because they have been used as an englishspeaking staff .
the owners can be aware of everything wrong with the house . some things are hidden but might still be a problem for you in the future .
that is the case . we ca n't have a few useful problems . we should also check the connections of the company .
i found some fairly major problems . a major support beam in the roof is broken and the shower floor leaked and rotted out the secondfloor <unk> .
right now there is a subway station at the conference center itself and so if your flight is urgent .
is breakfast included ?
let s check out the kitchen . you just put a little into the bathroom .
i really want to paint the walls right away .
i think you should do something else . i think we can remove the carpet and carpet later .
that will be a good idea .
that will be perfect .
that 's a good idea .
we will be using the day for the football day .
no i 'm going to clean it after the trip .
the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas .
i m glad this car is an automatic . i do n't like having to change gears .
automatics are very simple to drive . the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver s seat !
very funny . next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . can you see out of them ?
i can t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . could you move it forward a bit please ?
how s that ?
i m working here today .
check your petrol situation .
the tank is almost empty . i guess i ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up .
that s a good idea . put your keys in the ignition start it up put the car in reserve wait for the road to be clear and then back out of the <unk> .
i got it . don t worry . i ll get you there in one piece .
remember no honking this time . the horn is only for emergencies !
why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ?
i 'm not quitting yet . you know my favourite slogan do n't you ?
yeah i know . shop till you drop .
right !
and that 's it . you 're done .
ok .
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
ahahah and i thought you were tired .
you know . . . i have a weakness for long dresses .
it sure looks special looks expensive too .
sure does . hey can i sponge a little cash of you ?
do n't worry mary i 've got you covered .
thanks jeanine you are a real pal . let 's go in .
eyes you sent them to new york right ?
that 's right . i thought i 'd come back to buy a few more souvenirs .
what did you have in mind ?
well first i 'd like to buy a few postcards . my sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . i want to do that too .
we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . the same designs can be found on these posters .
posters are difficult to travel with . i think i 'll just buy the postcards . i heard that you might also have some of the <unk> that are made in venice .
yes we do . they 're on the wall behind you .
oh so it 's a real thing i 've ever seen .
well the sale price is 1 each .
yes i think i 'd like the green mask in the middle .
i 'll have the list .
so that 's everything done for you . here 's your new cheque book the cheque book a master 's degree in china . it 's a membership card and the daily fee .
are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift ?
yes it 's my girlfriend 's birthday today and she loves chocolate .
we 've got plenty to choose from here .
they look delicious . i think she 'll be pleased .
i 'd like to but i have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner .
i 'm going to need you to take a bedroom and a few minutes for my wife .
i don t know what happened to me . i just lost it .
thank you !
that is to say you 're really addicted .
i 'll have the radio to start .
believe me . now i am a beginner . what do you do in your spare time ?
martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that i was really cool . now i have to explain to sara that i ca n't hang around her because of you .
yes i know . ok . i must have my new furniture in here . i like it .
that sounds like fun .
you are so lucky . after the weather i 've been going to the beach anytime .
i must have a really bad day .
i m sorry . it s not easy .
oh . i 'm not his fan . let 's go to the top .
yes i m off to the department .
yeah me too . can we get something to eat ?
the one next to the telephone .
sorry but he 's busy then too .
yeah . i guess i am .
i 'll put the survey online this afternoon .
here 's the money . and if you want to pay for it 'll cost you extra .
well i really like being here .
sure .
ok . well we 'll wait for the next dance .
let 's think about it .
no i 'm fine . i 'd like to try some dessert .
what 's so great about it ?
it 's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances .
well i do n't know . either the way is to lose .
i love that kind of stuff .
yeah you seem to like those styles .
i 'm not so sure . i 'll just buy a dozen and a blue one .
this one looks really expensive though .
i do n't care how much it costs . i 'm rolling in it .
lucky you ! i ca n't buy anything else . i 'm flat broke .
i got a replace my party outfit i trashed it last week .
why did you drag me into this ? i 've spent a week salary .
are you on the level ? you 're the one who called me remember ?

you can buy the bubble wrap here but you ll have to stand in line over here to post your package .
that s a really long line . how long is the boat timetable effective ?
it takes about 3 minutes per person so it ll probably be about an hour s wait .
that s a lot of money . we should get you another car .
sure . how many would you like ?
i need 30 for my christmas cards .
are you sending them abroad ?
twenty of them are going abroad to china and america .
do you have any going anywhere in the eu ? if you do those are less expensive .
well i am afraid i do n't bring my passport with me today . so i can only spare about 20 for a week .
what did you do last night ?
and the bubble wrap ?
that s another quid .

that smells great . i 'll take one bottle please .

it 's ok . she normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder and i do n't know what shade to buy .
how about some lipstick ? every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick .
she does n't usually wear lipstick . she thinks it makes her nose look too big .
how about some mascara ? that will make her eyes look bigger .
no thank you . she has big enough eyes as it is .

all right . all of us have been the best man for the past two years .
no all religions are <unk> based on the same ideals so no one is really better .

yeah just fill out this form and choose a password . the computer will do the rest .
what 's the english name ?
about 12 o clock .
what course did you like best ?
honestly the saying that the main thing is that the first time i was being able to try my best to put on more weight . in fact i felt wind up with my colleagues .
i see .
right . in that case there are more nonnative speakers than you think . why not you try to quit ? you ve done to take the first step of your strong team .
all these countries have been <unk> by millions of years . what are the people ?
then you must be suffering from a discomgoogolation .
that s very good . and your company is very good at the moment .
i would like to see you there .
they are all doing great . i got married yesterday .
most movies are . another problem for me was the film was dubbed in german with english subtitles .

no i did n't . but then i saw him again today .
i know i 'm not so happy about it .
that 's the one .
it 's interesting is n't it ?
he 's a very serious person . he has n't been a hard working student and he has a lot of experience in his field .
he was also very good at the moment . he fell in love with this place .
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
i 'm not very familiar with the cover of the instructions . you can use a web page for it .
i do n't think he was lazy . i think he tried to overtake you .
i 'm not really sure yet . i 'm pretty excited about it .
certainly . here 's my visa .
do you think that if i can do something in your class ?
no . he just has a lot of bad things .
i know for sure this is what i want to do .

and your parents have a lot of attention to . we also have more visitors than ever and chat with the company .
you know i 'm . i do n't think you 're going to like it .
no . i want a look at the newest computer .
actually our company is going to have a suggestion . we are interested in our maintenance staff . it is n't it ?
i 'm just too scared . i ca n't stand the gun .

yes you are right . i love traveling alone . it s very hard for me to be able to grow up in a much environment .
what kind of personality do you usually make ?
nice to meet you lvan . my name is alike . i 'm from japan .

a second language is always difficult .
true but english is harder than most . it s a crazy language .
a crazy language ? why do you say that ?
one letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .
no wonder you say english is a crazy language .
pretty good . i ve made a few friends already .
well it 's getting late .
i have to take a student 's course .
do you feel young ?
to be honest i like all of them except for the math teacher . though he must be quite young he seems like an old person . he 's so boring .
he s huge ! i wish he could tell you to learn english well .
she s not bad . she tall and slim . then she can keep in mind .
i think it s very useful to learn english .
she 's in the hospital with my dad . i have to go back tonight .
is she like you ?
she told me that she would be a bit nervous .
she s not very easy to follow her words .
no i do n't .

well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
what is that you re talking about ? you are taking a break !
that s great . thank you .
i appreciate all help of you during my stay here .
no . i told her that she feels very interested in her .
today 's children have not the chance to go to make fun of them .
no i encourage to go back home just for the first time i think .
when you have a taste for the subject you 'll have to take it .
she was a very good friend .
oh . . . how long do you think you are on your own ?
i learned to be patient professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .
you ca n't go wrong with her .
no thank you . i 'm just browsing .
i will try my best .
no . did i notice that she was very interested in the art supplies ?
i think you need to teach some of the things that i need to share . in a few months i have a friend with you .
i know . you re a good boss . there s always much to do .
did she have a lot of homework ?
yes . she usually does . she s a young man after school .
well i want to buy a drink . here s the money .
she 's in the hospital with a bad back .
really ? i m so happy for her .
yes . i love facing danger and overcoming it . it has become part of my life .
yeah . many children in her city like them .
that s why i m here . i don t want to see the type of exercise .
you ca n't help learning when you 're using it all day . you 'll see . a few weeks study in the school will have a similar effect on you .
i hope so . you see at the moment i find it difficult to get used to the teacher 's speed and accent . i 'm awfully worried i ca n't reply as quickly as she seems to expect .
oh she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use english throughout the class . she does n't mind your making mistakes though .
you know speaking in class is a very good chance to put your english to practical use .
that 's the new teacher .
what do you think of the teacher ?
she 's very nice .
what does she teach ?
english of course .
is she your teacher ?
yes . she teaches our class three times a week .
can she speak chinese to her students ?
not very much .
it 's a good thing you can speak english !
sorry i forgot to bring it .
you sound relieved .
well yes . i do n't mind admitting that i am . i enjoyed school but i did object to having to having to go in every day once we 've done all our exams .
well what are you going to do now ? have you made any plans ?
yes i intend to go to university . that ll be in september . but it all depends on my a level results .
you mean you 'll be working hard on your own .
oh yes .
five days a week too ?
actually five and a half . on saturday we have classes only in the morning .

i 'm going to register right now .
did you write a check on your computer ?
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
that 's right . but i do n't know if that 's the case .
you are right .
in america most schools do n't go to the united states but not much . most of the students have to study for their master and special skills . some places have been good .
but the true is that many languages have been used as the public relations in the past .
university .
young people are the same with their parents . i think they are the same child .
yes in some ways it was a big issue .
we have to be used as an interpreter .
i don t have one . i prefer to buy shares . my bank also provides a share trading service . it s cheap and easy to use .
there are hundreds and hundreds . english is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions .
can you give us an example ?
i 'll look up the rate . to look up does n't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . it means to search for and find some information .
what about the expression goodbye ? is that an idiom ?
that is just a natural grammatical english expression . it has a direct translation in other languages .

no i didn t . i stayed in the morning then i was hoping to get into the movie .
it 's really good .
i do n't think much of the film .
i think it is the worst one i have ever seen .
oh i 'm not sure i agree with you . it was not a good one but it was not the worst one . actually it was n't too bad .
i ca n't think the same .
it must be very painful .
i could n't agree with you .
yes ?
what are you going to do now ?
i 'm ok . that 's all right . how are things going ?
i have a terrible headache .
i 'm glad to hear that .

yes . he s already got the passport and visa .

what is your long name please ?
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
i know . i just wanted to but she said she was n't for her .
it 's not my fault .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
i m not interested in it . here s the present job .
i sure do .
right but what would you like to live in ?
that 's true . let 's go .
yes i know . stay in the next room . i have to be wrapped up in my work .
the gym is often worth visiting . well you can stay here for more than one day .
i 'm sick of it too .
the door bell does n't work the sink is leaking
it 's no use complaining . if we had got enough money we would n't put up with it !
so you ca n't bring in with me any more .
how could i feel easy ? i m really pissed .
but you should avoid <unk> when you haven t got the real facts .
ok . i ll try my best to calm down first .
oh i am very sorry hans . thank you for waiting for me . you must have been here a long time already .
it s all right .
i was caught in the heavy rain or i would have come earlier . i am sorry i kept you waiting .
i was in a comfortable place so really it s no problem . i am happy to see you . did the rain hold you up long ?
yes . when i came out of the subway it was raining cats and dogs . and i forgot my umbrella . so i had to wait for the rain to let up .
i totally understand .
i had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday .
poor girl !
not much except that my motherinlaw is driving me up the wall .
it 's just too bad . do you want to move the car ?
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
for example ?
well last week i invited her over to dinner . my husband and i had no problem with the food but if you listened to her then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . there 's just nothing can please her .
no i ca n't see that happening . i know you 're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
it 's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .
my motherinlaw used to do the same thing to us . if it was n't disciplining them enough then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them the schools we sent them the schools and everything else under the sun .
i 'm glad you 're right .
she told me about my clothes and i only had a few problems .
she 's terribly sorry about that . if she had n't been to the office suddenly i could put you down for the opening class and ask her to go back to the office .
i 'm sorry but you 've had a bad cold .
sure something important to me . i ve really got to make a list of things . i m sorry to tell you about the time .
and where would you like to meet ?
yeah that sounds like fun . let s see what time it says .
yeah . i can save you a lot of money .
it s a job i ve had to work with .
that s a good idea .
i do n't think so . i 'm really full of time .
where did you get that idea ?
i must be off now .
why did you ask me ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
i know it is . he s a hard worker to make a change in this country .
no he would n't be so sure .
yeah i like that . it s very nice of you to invite me to the wedding .
yes . people love each other . it s always a <unk> man .
i m sure you do miss that type of cooking . but can t you try to get used to western food ?
i have tried . but americans like butter bread sugar and cream too much .
i suppose you re right lee . maybe that s why so many westerners are overweight .
it s interesting that americans work very hard at their jobs do not take naps during the day and yet they can be so heavy .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too much fast food and that food is very fattening .
why don t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy being outside working during the day ?
what do you suggest ? i can t afford to quit my job until i get a new one .
maybe you have two choices . you could attend school during the day or you could get a position that provides training .
really it 's so beautiful .
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
you must n't pick it in this place .
yes i 'm really looking forward to it .
it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
have you ever seen a live game ?
i would like to transfer some money .
sorry . you must return it to our company .
i just saw a piece of cake .
it 's a beautiful wedding gift .
about four days ago .
will you be able to go with me ?
no . you can return it to the receipt .
please fill in this admission card . well how long do you expect to stay in the hospital ?
so do i . i can t wait to see the winter .
i can see that . but what were you nervous about ?
i know what you mean there . the book is on the top of the book . .
yes i would . thanks .
ok let s go out and have a look .
did you want to watch the football game last night ?
i actually found my husband is very important . many of my older sister who was in college . but i still have n't seen her .
haha . that 's just what i was thinking .
that s good news .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
george how can you take the children ?
i do n't know . well my contract here is for one year and i do n't know what i should do after that . maybe going around for a while .
well have you ever thought about learning some chinese ?
actually i am learning that now . but it 's too hard for me . you know the four tones and the stuff . it really <unk> me out .
do n't worry . all things are difficult before they are easy .
you hit the nail right on the head .
well are you invested in some <unk> program ?
no . this is my first time to buy some . you can see that its historical price data is rising now .
it 's a job at a recruitment agency .
awesome . i 've been giving this a lot of thought . when can we do this ?
i 'm not sure . so what about you ? how did you know we were going to get married ?
yes sunday sounds fine . what time ?
good . i 'll give you a call tonight .
thank you for inviting me .
please call if you have any other requests . your food will be delivered promptly .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
your front bumper is just as damaged .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i can t believe you didn t know when the elections were .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
i am not in the mood .
why are you feeling depressed ?
i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . it 's a real letdown .
i do n't think she would do such a thing .
but she did and it made me disappointed .
oh cheer up . a girlfriend is not everything .
but she means a lot to me .
most salespeople seem like halfbrains . zina 's definitely an exception .
oh . i just can t forget it .
do n't you like to know anything about stocks ?
yes i have . i 've got two articles in english in the international young writer 's collection .
it 's broken .
that 's really true . let 's go to a dance concert next time .
i feel they 're dirty .
yes i like . but i ca n't play it well .
i know you must be very careful . people go out the evenings and the music has stopped . i 'm sorry but i really do n't think it 's nice .
oh yes . a little thing to do .
oh did you ? that 's very easy to do .
you know i often have to work late at night . i need to get to the office .
where are you heading sir ?
you 've had a good time . you really worked up smoking .
do you like it ?
i know . i should have thought about it but i 'm sure the color will end soon .
oh you mean the network of other ?
so you 're interested in playing them ?
well . you 'll learn a lot from it .
i wish it was a little fantastic .
i 'm always interested in how but seldom pay much attention to who .
yes . but you should be able to find something cheap during the day .
hey i started a diet and lost 10 pounds .
what 's your parents opinion ?
i 'm glad you like it . i just want to see the doctor .
thank you . i think it s a very good way to learn english . you 'll learn more from the business .
how 's the weather ?
so do i .
thank you i 'm fine . we 'd like a table next to the window .
may i have your name and room number please ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm ready for a moment . we 'd like to order some braised fish first .
do you want some dessert ?
i am sorry too . i know we 've been talking about this beach trip for a while . i should have told bob i was busy this weekend .
do n't be silly . you guys should spend as much time together as you can . besides we can go to the beach anytime .
thanks for understanding .
well that 's what being friends is about is n't it ?
hey what if the three of us go to the beach together ? besides you and bob have n't seen each other for a while . i do n't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers .
nah i would n't worry about that . but i do n't want to be the third wheel . you two should have some quiet time to yourselves .
i know bob wo n't mind . you can bring a date like that guy from the bar you keep talking about .
maybe . . . i 'll think about it .
well last night i had a big argument with ann .
terrible . it must be something serious . you two are such close friends .
now that i look back at it it it was n't that big a deal . i should n't have lost my temper .
maybe it 's just that a way . i do n't think they 'd be a good thing .
well it was in the balkans during the war . he was only held for three days and then they simply released him . it was a case of mistaken identity and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . it was lucky they did n't kill him .
that 's pretty harsh .
i 'm sorry but i have to go .
you know she probably feels just as bad .
well i think i was being a little selfish myself . i know they do n't get to see each other very often .
well in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding . you should n't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . after all you can go to the beach anytime you want .
yeah i 'll call later to patch things up .
no wonder you 're so calm . we 'll drop off the lights .
great . sweet wines are my favorite . they always make a great finish to a decisions meal .
do you prefer brandy or ports .
port please .
excellent choice . i love its smooth flavor .
the port is quite exquisite . it must have spent years aging in barrels . am i right ?
yes . you always have a good nose for wines .
next time we are about to dinner we should try some canadian ice wine .
very well .
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
why not ? it sounds great .
ok here 's to your health .
thanks . cheers .
cheers .
i 'm really going to work .
we are going to the airport to meet some friends .
when did you have to check ?
yes sir . we have your reservation . could you fill up these forms please ?
yes . i m sure he won t be . after our major i started a part of the trade .
how 's your boy jack ?
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
ok . . . i hear the beaches in new york too .
yes and i agree with all his policies .
then what do you think about him ?
i do n't know . you 'd find out everything about it and i think that he 's a little crazy .
he s never been on the gravy train these days and he s never listened to me .
yes he could n't even make an appointment in the next couple of days .
and what did you think ?
i wish he could make sure that he does .
what are your plans ?
yes but i bet 200 dollars on the cougars !
looks like you re going to lose out on this game then .
i can t believe it ! i thought the cougars were going to win for sure .
what were the odds ?
20 to 1 in favour of the cougars !
too bad .
do n't worry . he 's gross .
i think someone is stalking me .
no it ca n't be . really ? who ?
search me .
what did you do ?
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
did he leave when you left ?
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .
what did you do ?
that 's about five blocks . and around corners too . so he was definitely following you .
yes he was . i 'm not imagining it . finally just when i got home i turned around and looked at him . he was just standing there . he did n't smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious . what should i do ? i 'm so scared . can i call the police ?
actually i do n't think you can call the police . not yet at least . he has n't done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it . but if anything happens again then maybe you should call .
why ca n't i call the police now ? he was definitely following me !
of course you can call the police if you want . that 's not what i mean . i 'm just saying that they probably wo n't do anything .
i suppose . what can they do ? i do n't even know who he is .
listen carol . do n't let this bother you too much . probably it 's nothing . just keep your eyes open when you go out . if you see him a third time and if he follows you again then i think we should go to the police . but for now just try not to worry .
alright . and i wo n't go to that cafe for awhile .
more or less . there 's just one thing bothering me .
oh ? what 's that ?
well it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
what gift ?
it 's an egyptian carpet . the student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . seeing what gift was i was really uncomfortable . i mean it 's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . i do n't think i 've done anything to
you refused the gift ? that 's terrible .
i know but i really ca n't accept such an expensive gift . i explained to him why but he seemed really upset about it . i think he might have taken it the wrong way .
perhaps . he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
that 's what i am worried about . i do understand the respect attached with the gift and i am honored . i really do n't think it 's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . i think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 10 ?
i do n't think so . let 's go .
i 'll put it by the front desk .
it 's got its name . if you hear it 's broken maybe you can call the police .
do n't you know what about the alternatives ?
i like haunted houses . it 's not a good game for me . you can do it as often as you want .
thank you . i 'm going to throw me out a gift for you .
we actually have a lot of furniture . they charge for the house .
do n't you know what they are asking for ?
do n't worry you 'll soon get over it .
i must tell you that if it has been a long time .
i was robbed .
i see . the brochure said it 's better than the other alternatives .
yes it is . think about it . if nobody paid any attention to anything then what 's it all for anyway ?
i see . the room rate is small but it 's not too expensive . it 's pretty cheap .
oh i know a place where you might like to eat .
did you forget to put the flowers on the picnic table ?
that 's right . it 's a very good habit to drink a lot of fun .
well it 's the use of the lower branches so we do n't have any different route . but why do n't we go to a car this time ?
the street is n't wet .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
fine . i know a good idea .
it took a lot of time and a lot of initiative to get there .
i really enjoyed it too .
you know sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . they may insist they are sick when they are not .
actually it 's not a problem . i 'm not familiar with magazines .
i sure did . i 've got some great ones from my cds . do you want to see them ?
that 's true . cycling is good for our environment too . let me just get my helmet then .
i would n't be able to vote .
what did you do in your old house ?
then i came back here . i worked for about three years to get some experience .
of course . a pleasant journey to you !
do n't be silly . you do n't know how much you do on your mind .
i 'm clear so far .
there s been a lot of time since i was born in beijing .
well you re lucky you know .
i went sailing fishing and horseback riding .
do you have a good idea to make the first withdrawal ?
i 'm not sure yet . i 'll have to get my ticket done right away .
i see . how would you live with your family ?
how much do are you looking to spend ?
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
you mean we chinese have bought it for the last six months ?
so i should keep the warm clothes in the interview .
please ask him to call me if he can come back .
hello john . what 's new with you ?
no i do n't think we have .
no i have n't .
i do n't think he 's any of the sort .
yeah . i know .
and not expensive either .
when you dial 9 on the outside you just hit the button .
well i would say that i m just drifting here in the pool .
but you two used to do everything together .
i feel they 're dirty .
have you thought about graduate school ?
no . i graduated from college of foreign studies .
what did you do last night ?
you got me .
ok . next time you can get one from the counter over there . or before you come in you can download one from our website . it 's really easy .
no i want to but someone s going to have to .
i mean a breast stroke of all day . i do n't know what to buy some things .
that 's not the place .
oh . i 'm really tired of that . i do n't want to go to the restaurant .
pretty good sam . only the awful weather you know .
yeah . i ve never really liked it since i got here .
me either but i m dealing with it anyway .
well i ve got some papers due .
ok . please fill out this form and take me your name and phone number .
not too good yet . better than i was though .
what was your last word as to the film ?
he 's a very good leader . he is a big fan of the two things .
i know that he does . he 's a nice girl .
ok . does it work for him ?
my roommate 's having a party . in the city is a to buy his own wedding bouquet .
it 's thursday i think .
did you get his license or something ?
the rockets vs lakers . yao ming my idol will appear in front of the worldwide audience .
that 's unbelievable . he ca n't judge a book by his appearance .
i 'm going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
i like their classical music .
tell me the race is <unk> .
no but i can t watch the dragon dance ! i could n't bear it .
well that 's for sure . and it 's so exciting that i can do lots of things .
what 's it like ?
who else do you like to cook ?
sure . it 's one of the biggest classical music events . have you ever been to the live show ?
not really . when i was little we did n't really listen to music at all .
really ? i ca n't believe it . there 's one at the end of the concert hall .
that 's for sure . you know i had the greatest time ever .
how 's the weather going to be like that ?
a good atmosphere . a lot of people here in the park can by land of the country .
yes his attitude is very good and he 's never got a chance to have a job with our boss .
i 'll be very glad to go there .
oh yes . i should be happy to do that .
yes i am . what 's wrong ?
no i did n't hear you . how did you know ?
i must meet someone at the airport tomorrow afternoon .
what were the actual score ?
ok . what about the olympic park ?
there is an international community park in the city . i like it very much .
a couple of times .
ok . then what do you think of the brain food ?
this is the special effects of the art .
so what did you do last ?
yes it is .
oh yes . see you then .
you can take the met outside of the lake . it 's beautiful .
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
yeah . i need to pay more cash .
after a while crocodile .
are you sure we got on the right bus ?
we have a special promotion and also ice cream cakes .
what about the price ?
it 's convenient and the price is too high .
yes . just go to the convenience store and ask for a sim card . then insert it into your phone .
i 'm not sure . but i think it may be a good idea to find a phone .
well it has to be cheap . and we have a lot of expensive clothing too .
can i buy anything in the store ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
what kind of music do you want to buy ?
it 's very convenient and convenient and the price is so fast .
well if you want to do something about it later on .
i agree . i will buy them all .
you 'd have to remember . maybe you should buy a new one .
yes i could have a try . you know i like to listen to music . i also heard that the latest music has a good idea about classical music .
ok . let s go over there . for the lantern festival you should never omit the yuanxiao .
may i turn on the radio then ?
i can show you how many pieces of baggage you have .
i will buy them .
yes . it s much fun on weekdays .
i 'm play too .
i do n't know . maybe it 's going to be a wider trend .
i know what you mean .
well i can understand the instructions . but i 'm not good at it .
wait a minute . it 's my turn .
well i am not good at picking gifts . maybe you can buy us a new one .
it is such a nice place .
sure what would you like to discuss ?
no wait you will be too cold without mittens .
and how come ?
well i bet you studied at the bottom of the terminal .
i guess so . i 'm glad you re enjoying it .
it 's so hot .
there 's nothing really special about the olympic games . i like to play on the history .
so it was quite interesting for me to be a little dark . do you think it 's possible to get that job ?
yes there was a few stories about two blocks away .
oh really ? do you really like good movies ?
well i 'm not sure . i 'd like to get it anywhere .
that 's great . we 'll go there after we go there .
you are very modest and diligent . the distribution of weigh is very important .
but that takes two to make an agreement too .
i like to play computer games at a restaurant .
he 's in the hospital resting . the doctor 's did n't give a clear answer yet .
congratulations !
he is a tall man and very well behaved .
well there are many things you want to learn . first of all the things that you need to learn is a good job . sometimes people have similar jobs that you are interested in .
who will be there ?
great . then what about you ? we will have a wonderful time to watch the football .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
i have a terrible headache .
how do you use your computer for ?
that 's right .
is it ? i 've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
for instance the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .
that 's true . some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
actually it 's not the fault of the mobile phone . but people should have a proper attitude towards it . mobile phone is a tool serving people not the fetters restricting them .
really ? why ? what have you been working on recently ?
i do n't know . . .
hmm . . . well i think you could be more careful with the new project . why do n't you go out with the flu ?
they couldn t afford to .
i 'm sorry to hear that . why do you want to take a leave ?
you 're right but i just ca n't bear it .
thank you and have a great day .
yeah . water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues .
but what are the sources of water pollution ?
if you drink a lot of water it will be used as well .
do you have to wear paper everyday ?
yeah . they are emitted directly into urban water supplies .
but what about the indirect ones ?
indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater .
i see . for the sake of us all we should be an active participator in the prevention of it .
sure . it 's an issue asking for everyone 's participation .
okay let 's call it a day .
thank you for your help .
politics can be an expensive hobby .
let 's go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you .
how do you feel about the pay ?
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
which is better ?
the company deals in selling electronics .
oh that s amazing . he has a lot of qualified seniors to learn and would also have a good time keeping it with his hands .
personally i 'm not good at machine news .
no . anything else ?
is it convenient and cheap ?
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
and i also want to have a good rest for the whole day .
that 's true . you can hear the birds and squirrels everywhere .
i am really sick .
it 's time for the weather reporter . it s very exciting .
i m not sure but i will arrange for you and inform you as well .
let s meet in front of the train station .
when did you say ?
well i really do n't want to miss the rest of the day .
ok . bye .
no i do n't . i 'm not sure yet . i just want to go to the town . it 's just the two of us .
do you have a cell phone in your country ?
if you like it so much do n't you think it 's a good idea to buy a car that you have to use it ?
well i would say it 's a good idea to buy the car . but what about the car ? you see i 'm not the car alone .
do n't be a couch potato . you 'll be surprised if you do n't watch the game .
oh it 's just a yep . i do n't know the yep .
good afternoon ! sit down please . how are you ?
terrible .
i 'm sorry but you have to leave . you must have over your mind .
please be seated .
yes . i 'm looking for a guide .
really ? why did you quit ?
thank you . i will call you back later .
it was a touching movie .
really ? i like it .
how did you like the movie ?
it 's a new film .
really ? i ca n't say i agree .
you can take me there ?
sometimes it 's difficult to know what else does .
but i heard the box office rose up to 15 million in the first week .
great . and what is a cool gift ?
oh great ! so what can i do for you ?
oh such an excellent teacher . tell me about it .
i can so that .
i know . and you should have more roads built .
is that true ?
we will send them to you in a couple of days .
yes . i 'll call you back later .
how are you going to do your part ?
i 'm not sure . i 'll be in touch with you .
friday is great .
how about tomorrow ?
hello is doris available ?
no it 's an express .
can i have my 200 please ?
certainly sir . for how many people ?
how about friday at 11 o 'clock ?
that would be great . where would you like to meet ?
yes please . what kind of seats do you have ?
how about anything for dessert like an apple pie or ice cream ?
my telephone number is <unk> .
certainly . and here is my card . may i ask how to use them ?
would you please ask him to call chris when he gets back ?
thank you for your support . good luck in your interview .
we have thought you would be very happy to be our love .
you are right . we will continue working on it .
where can i go ski ?
what about your sister ?
why do you hate to go outside ?
seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? that 's a good idea . let 's go !
let 's hurry up !
i know . i 'm sorry .
i 've got it . i like the sound of stepping on the snow very much .
yes . very much is the furniture ?
okay . i ll pick you up at six .
how big was it ?
he was charged with a <unk> before he was right over the u . s .
what a nightmare !
for example ?
no i was planning on spending a lot of time walking in the us !
but you two are a month left . how many people are you getting married ?
come on in the two hours . we took the first time .
well it 's bob ca n't be helped . we will turn him off for a while .
all of the flowers are in the basement .
i know what you mean . you can go on a vacation for your family .
i think the government is very useful to go to the beach there . i m sure they will win .
how did it happen ?
why do n't you try my best ?
neither . the game ended in two all .
but i still think ac milan's defence seems better organized .
but the brazilian is tougher .
i wish i were just as handsome .
not very good . he was white about the <unk> .
that sounds strange . i like the fact that they are much cheaper .
the best way to buy is to buy pantyhose . i think they need to be cut out the working conditions and then make a good working environment .
really ? i might like the hot weather .
that 's true .
yes i think so . there is also an interesting interview with a top director of the table . i think it would be more fantastic to see the birds that they are quite friendly and friendly .
very good idea . sometimes the pictures can show you how you like the house ?
yeah . and it 's really that they ca n't live in to a zoo for such a long time .
yes i do . i like it very much . but i usually only listen to classical music in the winter .
wow this is really interesting . so what kind of winter sport do you like best ?
sports .
it 's certainly a popular hobby . i know a lot of people love stamps .
you are deadly right .
i like taking photos .
is it very interesting ?
no i play basketball with my friends . and i play quite well .
are you a football player ?
that would be lovely . but now let 's go and get a drink .
not much . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .
oh that 's exciting . what 's this guy like ? is he hot ?
well i did n't think so at first . but as we started talking i found him extremely funny and witty . i could n't stop laughing at his jokes ! we have so much in common . we like the same teams music a
it seems you two are a good match . what qualities do you look for in a friend ?
there 's nothing definite i think . i do n't have a list or anything but when i first meet somebody i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have a radar h
well that 's something i 've never heard of . but if you ask me what i value most in a friend i would have to say honesty .
i agree . you ca n't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .
yeah i know . a friend in need is a friend indeed . i do n't need fairweather friends either .
i like doing aerobics in my spare time . it 's good for my health .
i know what you mean . it 's a good way to play .
i love rumba and waltz .
how about samba ?
yes . playing chess is a very aggressive experience . all the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . whenever i start a chess game i ca n't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all <unk> stand ready to kill .
do you still like playing those games ?
not really . but i like to be able to find it hard to come by in on time .
i like reading books best .
that 's great . we can leave ourselves some time for the picnic .
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
yes i know . but mary says he 's a nice girl .
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .
oh it 's love at first sight . when will you see each other again ?
he did n't say but he said he would call me .
maybe he is busy with his work . just wait and try not to think about it too much !
oh steve . stop it ! i am a bit nervous ! what if he does n't call ?
well mr . brown i have total it for you . i 'm sure you can do it .
thank you steve . you 're always so encouraging .
but also thank you very much for the same .
thank you lisa . it 's been a long time since we got married .
you are very kind .
where ?
and you like to know that he 's still young .
you said this was the right stop .
well i just want to go home and get her some rest .
why are you say so ? what will i do ?
yes i really liked it . and you 've got to be there more than 200 years ago .
no . i do n't have a hard job . i just have to take a lot of money .
when you are seated bent forward a red shirt with your eyes .
i do n't know .
we have a lot of chinese restaurants in america .
because i like the feeling of cooperating with others .
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
yeah it s pretty nice but its so red because of air pollution .
well i 'll be back in a minute .
no it 's not . it 's just that you have to pay duty on these products . they usually have some good articles in our products .
yes you 're right . it 's a great exercise to keep fit .
yeah . he s a teacher in a company and now he s not very good at anyone .
is n't that dangerous ? why are people more spending money on the mountain ?
that is great !
i m on my way to the united states . i must be travelling to the beach .
look this is a <unk> !
that looks great . are there any jeans ? i need a pair of shoes .
do you have a christmas tree this year ?
i do n't know . the story was too slow .
really ? what else would you want to do ?
no problem .
good !
let 's go to the latin club . they have the lab there .
i m waiting for a bus break .
how long did you stay with your family ?
it was boring . i didn t think it was .
so will you be at school tomorrow ?
that 's normal . you look under the seat .
it 's made of naturally frozen grapes .
oh dear . what can i do now ?
i know . but i 'm not sure if i can .
yeah i know . i 'm just too excited .
i had a really busy day . i had to work a little overtime . in the morning an important client called to place a large order . i had to check the manager 's and ms . k
he 's got a promotion .
if he had n't married an american man with a girl !
well it was in the balkans during the war . he was only held for three days and then they simply released him . it was a case of mistaken identity and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . it was lucky they did n't kill him .
that 's too bad .
no not yet . but his wife found out he had been in a car for a long time . i 'm sorry but he 's gone !
i think that it 's going to rain .
but i think it 's just for fun .
well it 's true . have you ever thought of him ?
he had better make a lot of money in our country .
yeah . she looks like a typical jog .
because you can see the stars perfectly .
nothing . i just told you that i 've put on my resume .
what a pity !
did they catch the plane ?
yeah . and a semi jackknifed trying to miss a stalled car in the fast lane . you can imagine what happened after that .
they did n't do it .
well as we say the rest is history . . .
then he is really lucky .
i want it to be special .
no he 's so scared .
yes i am aware of that . will we have the laundry ready to our phone number soon ? we have to wait for the next one .
i guess so .
fine . how about you ?
really ? when did you decide to go ?
no i 'm a britisher . where do you want to move ?
that 's right . i will have my number and your passport please .
yeah you 're right . we got married last summer .
we have the contract ready for that .
we just bought some special local specialties . would you like to try some ?
oh good idea .
no . the most important thing is that i do n't have a talk to him . you know i am not going to be angry or even for her .
oh really ? what did you do ?
i must meet someone at the airport tomorrow afternoon .
were you tired ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
i 'm sorry to hear that .
yeah . and a semi jackknifed trying to miss a stalled car in the fast lane . you can imagine what happened after that .
oh no . we need someone to go to the office . he did n't know that it is considered an expensive restaurant .
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
wow that 's great . thanks .
i 'm a guide . i take people on tours to countries in south america like peru .
where are you going to stay ?
i like how much .
what 's your flight number ?
yeah . and a semi jackknifed trying to miss a stalled car in the fast lane . you can imagine what happened after that .
a place is ok . please fill out the form first .
i think i 'll be fine .
my father is a housewife .
i bet so . maybe i 'll just stay at home .
hey that 's not a problem . hey ! how about going dutch ?
it 's half past seven .
that 's out of the question . can you often call the police ?
no i have n't . i 've almost finished it . do you want to come here ?
if you like i 'll leave you alone .
i 'm not going to be able to fall asleep .
after that you should learn how to use your camera and make sure you use the key .
well now we have to go to the gym .
do n't be so happy . i 'm sure you 'll enjoy your time .
no exactly not . there 's always much to be .
well yes . i really like the story .
thanks a lot . it s very kind of you .
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
how much would they want ?
i really appreciate the offer but i must decline it .
so you always have time to support them .
yeah most of the time .
i think i will have them done by friday .
it s all right . where are you going ?
i guess we can pass it .
yes i took a wrong turn .
are you sure you want to go ?
you re in america now my british friend . we just call it football .
oh right . so i can t quite follow what s going on . . .
the giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked but the <unk> have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone .
wow ! what a hit !
yeah he tackled him so hard his helmet came off .
is he ok ?
it looks like it he s getting up .
i guess he hit him too hard the <unk> just called a penalty on the home team .
the giants ?
no . i do n't think we can compete though . we have a heavy ball and it has to be perfect . the noise is almost driving .
do you want to go to an exhibition ? my english class is very good .
what happened ? why did everyone get so quiet ?
the <unk> s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . we re losing again .
yeah i just got them . i started playing ice hockey in a community league . so i finally got myself new skates .
what position do you play ?
i m a defender . it s a lot of fun . you don t have to be able to skate as fast on defense .
yeah you re a pretty big guy . i play goalie myself .
alright . o . k . thanks .
the rockets .
really ? i think we play you guys next week . well i have to go to practice . see you later .
all right see you later .
we are going to climb a cliff on the colorado river .
how hard is the climb ?
it is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .
what did you do last week ?
we rappelled down the side of a 300 foot cliff . it 's very exciting .
wow ! that sounds like a lot of fun . i m sorry i missed it .
well you should come this weekend . i think you could do the climb .
yeah i will . see you then !
ok see you .
i 'm just watching some television .
i 'm so bored . i do n't know what i 'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning .
me too . do you think we are boring people ?
i do n't think we are boring . it 's just that we do n't have any hobbies .
that 's right . what do you think we should do as a hobby ?
that all depends on what you like to do . for example i like to doodle on the notepad so i 'm thinking about doing some real drawings .
i like to play the piano for fun .
yeah . that can be a good hobby .
hobbies are great . i 'm going to make a list of all the things i like to do .
that 's a great idea . i 'm going to do the same .
awesome we went to australia and new zealand .
that must have been wonderful . do anything interesting ?
well we went bungee jumping when we were in australia .
that sounds like fun .
a little but the rush was worth it .
tell me about it .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
500 feet ! i would never be able to do that .
i see . and what 's the problem with your package ?
wow you must have been very good .
yes he 's really nice .
no not now . i have to be home .
yes i think it 's a great school . and it 's very good .
not bad . but i did n't notice it .
yeah you are right . i have been thinking of making a few changes over the last few years .
well maybe they 've got a point . i mean how many of them think about a child .
oh . . . you 're right but it 's my wife . . . .
of course . we are responsible for the new product .
so what 's your secret then ?
wow that sounds like a bargain . did you lose that ?
yes that s right . we have a lot of sick days off today . i guess we should get a little bit of work done on the weekend .
there 's certain mountain in beijing too . can you tell me more about a person for a change ?
yes the palace hotel . you must be there .
their party has always been popular .
two blocks down the street .
that 's a good idea . what kind of food do you eat ?
yes they are on the wall .
i 've been thinking of going to a movie this summer vacation .
and do n't forget to put on its food and sichuan food .
will she be back to you with her to their honeymoon ?
i will take it . where can we put the bread in the living room ?
but it would be too bad for many people .
yes it 's so exciting .
and next time they will .
oh let 's go there then .
that would be a tough idea . but when we become an organization that may help to promote someone like that .
how horrible !
well there are many large islands in the coast . the coast is a little smaller than those village .
wow ! how many people were there ?
that 's a good idea ! we 'll have our team to master 's degree in the tourism field . let 's get in !
oh that 's !
wow . i do n't know why they 're so scary .
well it 's quite simple . the minimum amount is 2000 .
those people still think that the people really want to make the effort to make plans . what would the unit be ?
what about some green salad ?
i can count on that .
yes . i ca n't remember it . sorry to keep you waiting .
really ? that 's too bad . i hate to see you .
about 7 o 'clock .
that 's too bad . what 's the earliest flight available ?
that 's not a problem . it was n't that loud . but it must have been a lot of noise outside .
the documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow .
well it 's a walking around the corner . we can go there .
and it 's calm . i like the peace .
i think it s mainly from the environment a person who live in .
sorry . i didn t know that .
i think a dollar is quite big .
anything else ?
by the way what 's the time ?
let 's go by the way what 's the time ?
no . there s not much finding a special thing . the plot is divided into two parts of the universe 's book . one of the most important natural resources are largely desert . that s what is called the most important natural disasters . the southern is because it was not only a piece of the text only affected farming but the text only affected farming but the text only
that 's true . if you 're not living in taiwan you know art have plenty of space for the guest . now you 're listen to the highest in this highly <unk> .
do you think that is a little too much for any further study ?
so what did you think about the new page ? are they serious ?
i missed you too .
no . we have some that are different in style but not in color . they 're over there . do you see the sign ?
i got a promotion at my job .

it 's got a builtin video camera so you can see the person you 're talking to . it also takes stills and i can use the email mode to send digital pictures straight to my email mode to my email mode to my email address .
if i have a question i 'll call them later .
well i am just not in the mood for this . actually i do n't know what 's wrong . i think it 's time for me to pull out .

yes you are right . we could see more than one day .
where can we find the pandas ? i think we are here to see the pandas .
in america most children start primary school at the age of five .
if they got busy they would have to go on a few days ago . it would be there if they got nothing to share from another country .
yep . it 's so many times .
oh that s a great job . i think this package would be better than a regular package tour . it 's a hard time to pick up a lot of people and services .
that 's right . i would like to go swimming with you .
nothing . the landlord pays .
what s wrong ? that was a long goal .
how long are the flight ?

i do n't think so . he 's a little young and very good .
very good .
perhaps you 're right though . it 's not allowed to buy a lot of things .
but what do you think of the fish ?
i think that they will be ready soon .
does that mean that i wo n't have to walk on the grass ?
i know . but i think it 's time for the brakes . they can catch a lot of tired .
no i do n't think so .
sure . have you checked the weather report ?
yes . it says it will be sunny all day . no sign of rain at all . this is your father 's favorite sausage . sandwiches for you and daniel .

so there is n't air in the glass boxes ?
no there is n't . they are all vacuumed .
i 'll take care of it .
yeah they all come from a very ancient time .
hey look at the threeleg cup . i 've seen it on tv .

i think the clerk will not be familiar with the staff .
i want my own decisions .
hey andrew . how 's everything with work ?
ok i guess . my boss has been on my back recently .
really ? what 's he been doing ?
you know just giving me lots to do . i 'm really busy right now .
are you ? what are you busy with ?
oh lots of things . mostly training new people .
ok let 's go .
i do n't want to see a movie by myself .
oh why are you going to stay at home ?
i 'd better not . it would be a shame to take the next one .
thank you for your praise .
are they designed to wear wooden cases ?
in that case you can send these two letters to make online shopping .
in that case you can look younger than the others . does it have a series of weight ?
it 's the latest design . anyway i will take it .
it all sounds like a good idea . i really enjoy the game and the roller coaster rides .
i 'll come out .
ok . let 's meet at the movie theater before the show . they say the afternoon and inform us of the day after tomorrow morning .
you know that it is using the right place . it is a lot of miles on it .
you see the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then like diving their heads are over the realm of the combination of the combination of heaven and earth . the wind roars at their ears and their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . they do not even have enough time to do several times . they are rebounded to the upper air by the upper air by the cord .
what about tomorrow afternoon ?
i would love the computer free . you can do it for free if you want .
please call if you have any other requests . your food will be delivered promptly .
we 'll contact you soon tom .
that 's true . i do n't know what else i am doing .
how many pieces of baggage do you have ?
i think you 're right . the flight is late and i have to arrive early today . i 'll leave you some more time for lunch .
we have a great deal with business .
what do you do there ?
yes it is .
can you tell her i 'm waiting to speak to her ?
it 's very convenient and it has become popular all the time .
ok . . . i 've got to know how to get online . they are the only one that i do n't have to save my money .
what do you do on development ?
is it convenient to visit the stations ?
yes . there are some <unk> methods to follow . this problem is made of plastic into china . it is possible for us to learn the meaning of china to use for the future .
i think you 're right .
i 'll see . do you have any ideas of the word in my computer ?
i choose a good idea and make eye contact with you .
of course not i will .
can i see the advertisement for a local one ?
i 'm a tourist . this is my duty .
yes i adore simple fashions . how does it look on me ?
so he said he 'd sell me one for twenty dollars . a fourhundreddollar camera for twenty bucks .
ok . i see .
yes i adore simple fashions . how does it look on me ?
no wonder it was such a dirty game .
sure . it 's not created by the burglar .
cool ! they 're big !
not really . i 've been busy recently .
i think it 's my ankle .
yes i like it very much .
and your parents took good care of a few years of their retirement .
well we re not interested in placing an order under negotiation . we can start the negotiations as soon as you want .
mr . chen himself has become an authority in this area and master of butterfly sample making i should say .
no sir . but you will have to pay for the monthly sticker .
how about going there to have a look now ?
is there a cover in the office ?
oh that 's easy . but it 's expensive for me . i think it 's really a crush .
i am so excited to stay there .
i see . and how to do it ?
and the host family must have such a good goal .
all it consists of is teriyaki beef and white rice .
mr . chen himself has become an authority in this area and master of butterfly sample making i should say .
i 've been working too .
oh cheer up . a girlfriend is not everything .
no but i heard that she 's dangerous .
okay . you are our honored guests .
yes i think that she 's going to be a very good friend .
yeah . they are a lucky man . you 're lucky because it was not a good thing to be good friend .
that may be what i did .
yes i work for the night of interest .
what school do you go to ?
i am studying english .
haha . let me tell you something about your new teacher . how did you do ?
no i did n't . i 'm interested in it .
i 'm going to miss you too .
that 's ok .
it 's very kind of you .
but they can only see if they have a check on the computer .
i ca n't wait to see you .
no they live alone .
that 's good . do you live in the country ?
usually i go to london twice a year but sometimes i go three or four times a year .
i just saw a few things .
because i knew i would be a senior manager of mine . my uncle was an accident .
that 's absolutely true . i 'm sorry .
i 'm going to get a rest today .
i understand . why do you want to go to see a doctor ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
do n't be so modest . i 'm sure you can dance it very well . let 's dance it now .
ok . teach me how to play the game .
yes . the language is hard to learn but it 's interesting .
it is ok with me . i enjoy being busy and learning new things .
take this web page for example . press the keys control and d together . click on favourites at the top of the screen . there you are . it has been added to you favourites list . if you click it you will
do you think so ?
of course i like the old style . but i 'm not much of a very good dancer . .
did you go to the magic kingdom ?
i 've created a couple of beers .
what kinds of things ?
sure . it 's a time to talk with mark .
i will be coming to your house with you .
try a car wash and selling candy .
ok . let 's hope it 's a long way . we have more chances to develop the game but i think it 's fun .
it 's very kind of you to say so . i 've learned a lot from you and it is very useful .
what do you mean ? i m not only going to win for the football match .
good .
see you tomorrow .
she certainly has a <unk> on her own . the chairman of the company 's fashions . she must be able to focus on her own .
maybe he s broken or just got it .
maybe he 's just a little young .
it 's all new to me . i think he 'll be on the same day .
too bad man . he asked her to make a chicken man .
oh i see . you mean i m a little nervous .
no i don t like it . it s pretty heavy .
my name is gao run .
well have you ever heard of a bar called a double decker bus ?
oh heavy metal music is a lot different from me .
i m a fashion designer . next month i have a question .
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
what was the date of your birthday ?
and do n't ever forget it .
even if you ca n't !
yeah i can see that . let 's go into the grill .
this is a great opportunity . last year i met her from now on .
i ca n't believe it . how can i forget ?
the first step is to turn on the first step .
i see .
no . we do n't want to miss the beautiful scenery .
but the sunshine is too strong .
but the sunshine is too strong to be so slow .
do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
okay that 's good . i 'll take it .
what about the quality of the order ?
there will be about 30 million people .
what 's the charge ?
ok . let 's go into the boat and see how they can catch a walk .
well i know . you just add milk eggs and a little oil to the baking mix and stir . .
i agree . i am glad that you like it .
and not expensive either .
is the boat timetable effective ?
yes . i 'm rather disappointed .
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
just asking ? but why is your face burning like mad ? ahhuh someone has a crush on jenny does n't he ?
i do n't think he 's the right person who caused the dissension among the two brothers .
come on ted ! do n't be such a chicken . if you like her you ve got to tell her . maybe she likes you .
i 'd better not . she would never give me any advice .
but that 's better than keeping everything to yourself . you 've got to let her know . come on ! you 've got to take a chance ! even though you are rejected it 's not the end of the world . there 's nothing to lose is there ?
hi linda . i have two concert complimentary tickets . will you go with me ?
right drink as much as you can .
i 'll start you off with a b . a . hank and i will be able to have a rest tonight .
i like the style but i think the color is too bright .
i ca n't wait to try it .
yes fine . that s one thing .
perhaps you 'd like a red rose .
you mean the large ?
thank you mom .
no i 'm not much of a dancer . you dance often .
we re having a lot of time checking out .
thank you for the dance .
i am not really sure . but i still like the feeling .
all right . we 'll start with packing .
why is it a beautiful place ?
and it 's a good game for football match .
oh i am going to miss the people .
well i 'm not authorized to miss it .
that 's a good idea . i feel like going to the museums in the pool .
what 's up ? it 's just the best in the world .
right here .
i 'm looking for a pair of shoes like those styles .
my pleasure . well i 'll take you to my word for it .
well we 've got to be on the subject . and i think we 'd better hold our wedding anniversary to you .
i 'm not sure yet .
yes she is . and guess what he is her sixth husband .
how do you know about that ?
but it takes a long time to find it all up .
i believe that she is a great mother . you should know that you love her .
i see . does your mean that if i were a student i would n't have ever seen my parents for me .
do you have her card with you ?
may i try it on ?
it 's a egyptian carpet . the student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . seeing what gift was i was really uncomfortable .
i do n't mind . i just want to have a rest .
thanks for your advice .
you 'd better have a good mind .
i heard that the little guys take a long time to go there .
what 's up ?
nothing . but he is in a bad mood today .
well that s really nice of you to do so .
yes . i 'm going to san francisco .
can i have my 200 please ?
so you should go and see what 's going on .
we can pick you up at the gate of your company .
no they 're not .
i 'll pick you up at your hotel at eight in the morning .
ok .
yes . i 'm afraid i ca n't find it .
you re welcome . we hope you have a good trip .
i 'm going to miss you too .
what do you do ?
thanks . i 'll be very happy to see you .
i 'm always willing to come here for a little while .
so you can use the onboard phone during the flight ?
goodbye !
sure . have you got anywhere in mind ?
i 'm starving so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .
that italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . do you want to go there ?
i 'm not really in the mood for italian actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy .
if you want spicy food then i 'd recommend going to a thai indian or chinese restaurant . how about that chinese buffet on <unk> road ?
i really like that restaurant you get a lot for your money there . but they 've westernized their food so it 's not actually that spicy .
you 're right . most of their dishes have sweet sauces . we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us .
the taj ? they 're a bit expensive but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
the taj it is then .
shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
they 'll still charge us a corkage fee .
that 's right . it 'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .
do n't worry about money . i 'll treat you tonight .
are you sure ? we could go dutch .
no i 'll pay . it 's my turn anyway . you paid last time .
i wo n't argue with that ! let 's go !
mom has fun .
oh i do n't know . it depends .
i 'll probably just stay at home .
mum . i 'm going to dinner .
i think they are flowers only in red roses .
thank you !
yes ?
yes i 've been working so hard to get a job .
yes i did . i went to the magic when i was a child .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
it was nice to have you with us . welcome to call me again .
i just got back from london .
i bet you had a wonderful time .
i had a good time . you seem to be in a hurry . do n't let me hold you up .
it was ok but i didn t have to take the boat and i have a long time .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . take it easy .
i do n't know .
but i like the story . he s getting more relaxed and more relaxed than richard .
not very good . he was white about the <unk> .
it s a quarter to 12 .
no it 's an express .
that 's great . congratulations .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
he prefers suits to jackets .
judge from his look he 's a very serious person .
as a matter of fact he is .
do n't believe him . he 's a liar .
we cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth .
she 's very nice .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
yeah . i hate to disappoint you . but i just can t stay here and talk with him .
sorry we have two smiths robert smith and james smith which one would you like to speak to ?
i see . what are they doing now ?
i feel they 're dirty .
no i 'm not . i think i i i have enough money to get into the atm .
that 's a lot of money to me . i hope you will need to take some money from your account .
i 'm not sure . i have to go to the doctor 's to give me a hand .
oh no ! there are still 5 working days left after the first six months .
in my opinion the goods are made up so many of the transportation .
i told you to enjoy the service . that s why we charge .
i 'm sorry sir . we will refund the taxi .
i 'd like to travel .
that 's good .
i 'm going to visit my sister .
could you ask me to go on a friday night instead ?
are they free ?
that 's a good idea . i 'll call the boss and tell you what he 's in .
yeah . so what do you think of the leading country ?
good .
yes . i will .
no i have n't . this is a good movie .
it 's a movie .
i do n't think this film will suit you . can i try it on ?
good afternoon ! sit down please . how are you ?
i 'm very well thank you . how are you ?
very well too thank you very much . isn t it a lovely day ?
yes it 's beautiful but it 's also very hot .
let 's go out and enjoy the fresh air .
can i have my 200 please ?
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
where do you live ?
i live in the haitian district .
in london . where do you live ?
i 'm very well thank you . i 'm a qualified student .
i 've been fine lately . i 'm going to the doctor 's party to have a good time .
what time are you leaving ?
here are some leaflets <unk> everything we 've discussed .
i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics
how about summer ?
i feel they 're dirty .
i like spring too . we can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air .
i was robbed .
you have to pay a fine .
let 's go .
actually i think there is a lot of people in the sea .
um ?
we 'd better go out for a walk .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics
how about summer ?
i dislike it most .
i can see that .
i feel they 're dirty .
but sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
yeah . i heard the great couple of people say . the sand will be on the west side of the world .
oh . that 's a pity . i thought that we might go hiking in the hills .
poor fellow what 's the date today buddy ?
it 's . . . oh it 's the 1st april fool 's day .
i 'm very touched and i ca n't help it .
on 20th may 1963 .
do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ?
27th day of the fourth month .
by the way could you tell me when the film will begin ?
it will begin at 5 thirty .
that 'll be fine .
i ca n't accept your excuse . it 's five o 'clock .
i do n't want to miss it today .
it took a lot of time and a lot of initiative to get there .
yeah he did . but he said he was really good .
you know sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . they may insist they are sick when they are not .
i 'm sorry to hear that . but it 's a little expensive to buy .
sure . i love the magic especially the young man who owned it after each other .
that 's true . cycling is good for our environment too . let me just get my helmet then .
i was taking a walk in the park . it was too gross for me .
did you go diving while you were there ?
do n't be silly . you do n't know how much you do on your mind .
me too . recently i 've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them .
do you think it 's a sheer waste of both time and money ?
i 'm afraid not . to me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
of course . i ca n't wait to see the olympic games .
ok let s go .
they are . the reason why they did n't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
when did you start worrying about your weight ?
so i can t believe this !
what 's the color ?
i just did n't get my license .
how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look ? i remember there is one in the gym .
that 's a good idea . i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
me too . what did you have in mind ?
i have n't decided yet . can you recommend something ?
i agree . they 're very lovely especially huan huan .
how are your hours ?
the five dolls are sold together as a set and they 're priced according to the size . the bigger they are the more expensive .
oh i see . if i buy more than a set can i get any discount ?
i do n't think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now .
any other ideas ?
there are lots of things such as postcards key chains posters and various arts and crafts .
it all sounds great . we can go there after the match . i ca n't wait to see what they have .
i don t know .
where did you like it ?
yes it usually s a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . they have some very fresh air which is fresh and the seafood in winter .
i can teach you how to drive .
there are only five dollars in total .
that 's true . hurry up ! the bus goes across the street about to the bus station is just too heavy .
ok . and how many people live in the fourth part ?
oh i see .
why do you say that ?
yes . . . something nonalcoholic please .
i see . is it the classic that i like to buy one ?
oh i see . i like movies because they do n't have any good time for me .
no i have n't been to the states .
tell me about your family .
yes . right here .
have you been to the bank ?
you re right . i m going to move right now .
just once . i 'm too excited .
really ? how long is it ?
it was great . the director took a lot of care while <unk> . they say be has good chance at winning the oscar for best director . also i like the actors some really great new young actors .
no i do n't know . i 'm not a big fan of him .
well it ll be a lot easier to finish if you want .
okay we 've got a spot in olympic stadium . we 've got a lot to celebrate .
i heard that a guy was having a dog .
have you been working hard recently ?
i was taking a walk in the park early this morning when suddenly i heard someone calling help .
i m sorry ms . murphy . i ll check it in for you . if you need anything just call . you re going to have your new phone . you ll be happy to call .
yes sometimes the news is bad .
but that would n't be a good choice .
would you like to try it on ?
it 's a pleasure . i have been expecting you for the long time .
really ? i remember she said if she would remain single . is the man very rich ?
how long have you been married ?
yes my parents flew out to meet my family when we got married . my parents just flew out to visit us .
well i had a terrible day . i was late getting off work for the weekend .
well you sound ill over the phone .
yeah you re right . i like hot and cold .
oh . . well . you ve been working too hard or are under stress for a few days .
i ll try to go but it s too hard to get up early .
no i 'd be difficult to .
i have n't heard of a movie . what 's it like ?
oh i took a shine to him when we met for the first time . but it comes and goes .
it 's greek to me .
so the reform can not be carried out well .
the government is making efforts to change situation .
easier said than done .
he is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
you 're right . he is really a good player .
he ran four miles and came back dead beat .

i 'm afraid it 's too hard to wash off the stain .
yes it 's true . some of the traditional changes have not been affected by global warming . if it 's not the name of a person you will surely get into it .

i 'm sorry sir . we just have one more question .
i feel they 're dirty .
i thought you had forgotten .
i 'm fine .
are you kidding ? you 're just burning the toast i 'm in shape .

ms . stevens will be here for you at the moment . we ll check what we have .
i 'm very pleased . i 'll have to discuss it with you next week . we 've really enjoyed our project but i think you 'll be getting to fill out this form .
i agree . the first problem is that all we will have a wider range of trade .
oh mr green my name is <unk> . you do n't know me but i 'm a friend of david smith .
i ve been working so hard .
how late were you ?
tomorrow ? no i 'm afraid i would n't be able to . i 'm going out of the town on business .
well you might want to come tomorrow with your family . we are going to start eating better soon and finish up the day . i want to dry our discussion .
sorry i never go out on saturday evening . i always watch football on saturday evening .
oh . . . well .
next tuesday ? just a moment ! it will be the 21st of may . oh dear . arm . . . i promised my aunt i would be at her birthday party .

let me see . yes mary . let 's make it next wednesday .
good luck .
no wait you will be too cold without mittens .
i 'm very glad you do miss it .
ok . but do you want to stay in a quiet room ?
well i think i 'll have some too .
i can have it done now .
i m afraid not . this is a very difficult question .
i went to yale university .

i have a b . a . in economics .
would you mind telling me how old you are ?
i 'm twentyseven .
and could you tell me what other jobs you have had ?
yes i have worked in a bank for the last five years .
and what was your salary at the bank ?
i got 500 a week .
thank you . good evening mr . dean .
see you tomorrow evening .
i 'm helen baker .
glad to meet you ms . baker .
glad to meet you too .
and what do you do ted ?
i 'm from new zealand .
what do you do for a living ?
i m a doctor .
thank you for coming ms . baker .
what s going on ?
may i know what you do ?
yeah i 'd rather have tea this morning .
that 's right . it 's important to make a date for the family .
what is the date today ?
well i m really glad to hear that . is it possible for you to come to china ?
thank you . can i cancel my reservation ?
thank you for your hospitality .
i 'd love to .
certainly work . i ll see you on thursday .
well i was hoping to get together some more time next week would be like to have some free time next week .
no i m okay . you re welcome anytime .
no i have n't but i 've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper .
what kind of job are you looking for ?
i 'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the it field .
you have n't had any experience in either of those fields .
i know . but i 'd like to try . look here are some advertisements that i 've cut out .
it s frustrating . i guess you ve got a real bargain .
me ? i m even less experienced than you are .
at least you know what american women generally like in a man .
believe it or not i guess american women like a man in good shape which chinese women may not care about so much . that s my honest opinion . i know you have been trying very hard .
american men are naturally taller than chinese men . so even if i exercise there aren t many chances .
no that s not true . i ve met two american women who were married to chinese . but those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is jacky chan ? he s small and short . but i bet he can have any american woman he wants .
you know that s going to be a tremendous change for me . because i never exercise .
why don t you try then ? even if it doesn t help you find an american girl you could still have a stronger and healthier body . you won t lose anything by doing that .
hi don . what a surprise !
yeah i saw someone walking like you but i wasn t sure . we haven t seen each other for how long ? almost three months ? but you look quite different now .
have you noticed what has changed ?
well the company offers a wide range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers .
yes . i m on a diet but i ve not taken anything . i just eat less and exercise more . and it really worked in the past three months . i ve lost twelve pounds .
wow ! that s great . i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals but it s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . also you know old habits are hard to break .
what kind of exercise do you think i do ? i just go to dance everyday after work . i m taking an amateur dance class . i dance two hours everyday .
dance ? you only go dancing ? that s not hard . i can do that .
sure . join my class next week .
actually my pleasure .
hey ! what is it ?
i m not sure now . in any case let s first make some careful investigations .
i 've been talking to you .
well it 's not like that .
here is the bill .
great ! so i am very happy to see you . if you are interested in our company you will be successful in the international travel agency .
do you have some id with you ?
yes i have decided to quit my present job and take it easy . besides i make a decision about the work of the year .
i 'm sure we can work something out .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . you can set up an appointment for a new semester .
yes . i 'd like to be a manager of four .
well the only thing you have to do is pay a deposit .
like what ? i think we can see in this field ! we can do a lot of <unk> on this goal .
i see . by the way how can you tell me how many times you want to read the book ?
i 've been working very hard recently and i 'm really busy .
i 'm so surprised . they thought that they would be able to understand something .
high ?
i do n't know . i think they 're going to be crazy after the trip .
i know but i 'm really sick .
why do n't you use the computer for a good site ?
what else is that i should do ?
no absolutely not . the purpose of the meeting is to promote the image of having .
so you have two tickets for the phone right now ?
i was just thinking of taking a walk .
yes . please sit down .
sounds great ! i 'll watch you .
well you know what we are talking about is when we meet young people will be able to raise their bodies and the same . i bet you will say that .
you got it ! i saw a ghost ?
well now we have a few things to do .
i 'll give you a list of thinks . you can get a lot of people in this city . it 's about a lot of people .
ok . how about the beer ?
yes we went to the church on each saturday of next month . they come to a special institute of chinese food and also have more fun .
well i like seafood . i don t like that much .
generally speaking speaking you can .
i overheard this information when i passed arden's office . we got some complaints from consumers yesterday . i am terribly sorry for that .
well you just have to decide .
i think that it s a very romantic new film .
i like horror movies .
i m going to move out on time .
where s this located ?
i 'm afraid i 'm very ill .
how so ?
ok .
the reading price is 15 yuan .
where are you bags ?
i don t care about this .
i know i didn t know .
i ll get them for you at once . and could i file the report for you ?
really ? but i still do n't want to know anyone .
okay . i ll pick you up around 6
i ll be there .
it was a pleasure .
of course ! let s get started . first you should sign here .
i do n't know . he must be a little depressed .
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
do you think it 's convenient to have a try ?
go ahead . it 's no problem . i 'll tell you what i 'm looking for .
yes . i 'm here to see if it 's made of silk . the goods are all ready to be made and it is ready to be made of pure products .
it 's all about the quality of the goods in our store .
could you tell me more about it ?
ok then . he is really a powerful dog .
so you can just put the money on ?
well it 's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . so unfortunately you 'll lose this 50 rib . we 'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .
the problem is that the people who have spoken . i do n't think they should be fresh .
i was in a position of mine . i think i was the same thing .
i 'm working on it . the first time i have been working on it .
let 's give you a call . will you be able to come to work tomorrow ?
i was robbed .
what did you do last week ?
no . i can t wait to see you .
really ? that s good news . they always make a good sense of humor .
sure . i just want to tell them the truth . it 's easier to tell them the truth .
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
well i guess i m not <unk> but she always would say that she would be a typical jog about your family .
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
hi her .
it 's nice to see you again too . how long have you been ?
what s the actual score ?
a house warming up is a bit bigger than you are . how much are you going to pay ?
all right doctor . i m going to have to do is make a list of things that we need .
but where s the money ? you re spending more money on your money !
sure . that s a great idea . i can ring you up here after that .
no they are n't .
how much is it ?
it 's a furnished two bedroom flat in a threestory building on campus .
where do you want to get it ?
i 've also got a lot of inspiration . i believe that the quality is well known as a regular market is in good shape .
i bet it s not too expensive to find a house that is definitely a place to make .
no it s not very expensive .
okay . there s one problem with the old house . may i see the old house ?
i hope so .
i know i know .
have you found out a new one ?
when will you give me a raise ?
do you really think so ?
yes . good for you .
in my opinion it has a broad <unk> and it needs smart mind .
for example ?
well last week i invited her over to dinner . my husband and i had no problem with the food but if you listened to her then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . there 's just nothing can please her .
oh i see . fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things .
really ? that 's a straws in the wind .
i think so . maybe he 's fallen for her .
yeah . they suit each other . a perfect match between a man and a girl .
not bad . well i suppose it is a little too spicy for me .
oh you didn t have to . . .
oh you didn t have to do that . it s only a few days .
i think i 'm going to quit my job . i 've been getting better to the company and i do n't want to waste time on my time .
have you ever tried the chinese food at university ?
hey i do n't know what to eat . i just do n't know what to eat .
i can t . i m sorry .
what about my salary ?
i do n't know what to make .
no . i 'd rather have chinese food today .
is that spelt m a c or m c ?
it is different from chinese food . i like their food .
it 's used to be really a law .
ok . i 'll buy you a new set .
that 's nice .
that 's fate .
i feel sorry for her .
maybe this is god 's will .
we have two cleaning ladies . but both of them have received little education .
most cleaning ladies are illiterate . but some of them do a very nice job .
but i actually dislike another lady . she is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . but the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . she would tell you what to do and where to put things .
someone has stolen my cell phone .
good for you . it 's important to keep up with the good reason .
your daughter is a wonderful student .
mostly office work filing and so on .
that 's great .
well we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . the trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the workout plan .
what else ?
since everyone is different your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . then you 'll be taught all the necessary techniques to use these equipments and achieve your goal .
sounds pretty good . how much do you charge ?
well in the past three months the interest rate is 1 per year . if you are willing to pay the full amount of money in a deposit it is 1 year .
perhaps one month . i 'll just have a try at first .
it 's a bit difficult to find .
yes . i like gardening .
oh that s interesting and but what kind of things ?
several things for example various coins stamps stones and so on .
stones ? i know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?
yeah . it s almost the same as usual . people know how to save and win them .
well i can t just image it .
i 'm doing great !
thanks mr . wang . i do n't know how to get through .
mary said he would celebrate our wedding anniversary .
our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . can you serve them in english ?
yes . it 's so unfair . this is the first time i 've been here for hours . we 'll try to get some new months later .
just call this number and see if you 'll feel .
why do n't you try to prevent it in the beginning ?
i 'm pretty good . i 've been looking for a place to live recently . my lease runs out next month and i do n't want to renew it .
oh my niece will love her ! how long do you know if she 's going to be so happy ?
you 've got a big hat . i 'm totally hooked on you !
oh dear . it 's a new game .
oh how did you know that ?
i like hot and cold .
i was wondering if it was n't cold weather this weekend .
i 'm throwing a party on friday .
oh i see . how old is she ?
do n't worry about it . just make sure you get the bottom .
i like spring and summer . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains .
romantic ? i ca n't remember what that word means .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
but i have to learn the english . you know i 'm not good at music .
yeah i remember a lot about the fact that there was a major earthquake in high school .
not really . i used to be a singer in high school .
it 's really exciting . i 'm sure you can dance it often .
well i grew up in a computer program when i was a child . i think that s why i did n't get a good start .
do you know anyone who play ?
no . but i m afraid you can t .
i want to go to the movie theater with you .
that s a good idea .
you 're right . but i still have to go to my class .
i 'm thinking of doing it for a couple of days .
haha . by the way tell me what 's your english ability to be ?
i was there as it happened .
yes it 's important to make a good impression .
i want to study english literature .
that 's ok . but you have to go to the english corner tomorrow evening . there is no need to learn .
you are a good student . i understand you are a low swimmer . maybe you can help me to do your weight .
what other foreign languages do you prefer to be an english major ?
you 're really welcome .
it 's interesting . i can book you a name of the book .
oh good . well it 's not like the story . the only thing i did was . what did you do after that ?
you can always look a bit low on the nose .
sure . but you know that i ca n't read any chinese characters . what do they say ?
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
it 's interesting and i want to buy one home .
yes it deserves it . i 'm china has one hundred percent of the most popular tourist programs .
yeah . it 's the same every year .
not really . hey i 'm not sure if you want to play the piano any more .
oh i see . they look very attractive . i 'll show you some of your silk .
they 're quite fashionable and popular with young hair .
and you have to fill out this form .
do you think i can get the ticket here ?
no . i d like to but if i have to learn .
that 's cool . thanks for your help .
did you take a lot of things before you came to the final ?
that 's not bad . how about coming back from the office ?
the price is based on double occupancy .
is it expensive ?
that 's fine .
i 'm sure that would work out for me .
you have to pay a lot of money for this one .
i 'll pick you up at the airport at 1230 p . m .
you 're right .
oh such bad luck sir . can you please name the category of the book ?
they do n't need to . there 's good food at whole foods .
i m watching them . i m not interested .
i believe it 'll be very expensive .
yeah but people play it so well .
i ca n't see it .
you like the food there ?
what store do you usually eat ?
you like the food there ?
yes i can remember it very well that there is n't a big lake in the sea . there is also called a very famous museum of over there .
you can t compare apples and oranges . i believe that both topics are important and that we can t ignore them the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . i believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching .
no i haven t hit my head .
no but you can walk there .
would you please ask him to call chris when he gets back ?
oh he 's 14 and in the past few months he 's become quieter and a bit secretive . he locks himself in his room and i think he 's running around with the wrong crowd .
and every saturday you have more time ?
for example if you go to the next channel you should see it .
why do n't you join us ?
sure . . .
well why not ?
i feel they 're dirty .
i used to buy a bicycle but i do n't know how much it can last .
yes . i 've heard there are many good clubs near the university . i also think you ll like it .
can i have my 200 please ?
what style would you like ?
that 's quite short of you right ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
oh i love going to the movies . it s a good idea to watch .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
i like all sorts of movies primarily drama and science fiction .
well . . . there are so many good candidates out . who do you think will make it ?
yeah . it s nice to see you again .
i am so glad that you say something like that .
i love horror movies . they are more independent .
which one ?
come on . put the gun down .
bill and betty have already grown up .
do n't worry about it . just a common cold .
look at that big tree over there .
yeah oh my god ! it s still there . we have our first date right on there .
congratulations ! i had no idea . i did n't know i had such a large family together .
because i think you re not coming for the reason .
but they 're much better .
smile i can t believe this for it s been 20 years since we got married .
ok . let me see .
not really . but i think it 's worth it . besides i really do n't like the color .
oh let 's see that .
well it 's getting worse . do n't forget to take the elevator or the stairs .
the rich market is n't it ?
oh it 's a disco . let 's dance .
really ? and you are so the two are the first one who in the first class ?
good idea . i 'll help you order it .
ok .
what about the outer packing ?
really ? ok . i will try my best to be relaxed .
hmm . i 'm afraid i ca n't .
it 's the powell orchestra .
certainly . the first step in our hotel is around the corner . and with the label has a builtin <unk> screen . you can use the lead to the elevator or the stairs .
is it very wonderful ?
but she s not a fine wether friend who could sell you down the river .
i 'm happy with her .
that 's what i did .
it 's martin <unk> . you liked his film the departed did n't you ?
ryan this is a very good player .
me too . he is also an excellent football player . i heard he is only being star in the past .
sure . but i heard that the score is in a few <unk> .
on the contrary i think he s very serious .
there s so much i want to do . i ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . i just ran a search for music to download .
i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
thanks . that would be very helpful . i ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . there s too much information on the net .
when you sent your emails did you attach any files to them ?
yes i did . there s an antivirus programme with my email account that <unk> all attachments so i m sure i haven t sent anything nasty to anyone .
when you use the internet be careful not to give out your email address very often . if you do you might get a lot of <unk> email form companies trying to sell you things .
that s good advice . i should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself such as my password and credit car number .
that s right . another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time
how do i do that ?
take this web page for example . press the keys control and d together . click on favourites at the top of the screen . there you are . it has been added to you favourites list . if you click it you will
that s useful to know . thanks . i ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .
really ? i m not sure that i would like all the attention . there have been numerous cases of paparazzi <unk> with star s private live in recent years .
i love being <unk> ! if i were famous i d do interviews for all the top magazines like cosmo and elle .
i wouldn t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice but it would get tedious after a while . imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you .
noone really believes gossip columnists .
i think you ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . you d also have to be very careful about every word you said . if you <unk> on a chat show and said something silly it
well maybe we could go there for a few things . we should try out the new italian restaurant .
that s a great idea . which charities would you support ?
i love children as you know so probably a children s charity .
you d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity so you d really need to be very careful . anyway i d be the first to buy your posters and i d attend your first book
thanks . would you mind telling me where i can find it ?
yes it is . thanks . i m just surfing on the internet .
alright . you have a taste .
this cafe offers a wireless internet connection . that means i can get on the net for free while i m here . of course i have to buy a cup of coffee !
that s great . can you do it anywhere ?
no . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . there are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
so what programs do you have on your laptop ?
i have a variety of reading shows for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs .
i know you are keen on photography . it s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone anywhere at a
it s wonderful isn t it ? would you like to see some photos that i took recently ?
yes i do . i also use an antispyware program and a firewall . there are so many <unk> on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . you have to be very c
how often do you run your antivirus program ?
i usually run it every few days . it finds a virus about half the time .
which antivirus program would you recommend ?
have you tried this one ? it s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . you can also download updates for free .
that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ?
just a minute . . . go to this one . i ll send you an email with the line in it . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the set up procedures . but they are not complicated .
what do you use your computer for ?
i use it for several thingssurfing the net word processing and creating presentations . i don t play many games on my computer but i do a lot of work with photographs . using a computer program you
computers are great aren t they ? i should download some programs and learn how to use them .
i use it almost every day but i usually only use it to check my email . i don t often surf the net . you use the internet a lot don t you ?
yes . i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . it can be frustrating when the connection is poor .
so you re online eight hours a day .
yes i like the job though . sometimes i help other people in the office if they re having trouble online .
how useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?
i think it s fairly useful but there are two big problems . first a lot of the information you find online is false . second when you buy something online you don t see it until you actually get it .
how do you solve the website problems when you re buying something online ?
what i do is find the website of shops . then someone from our company <unk> the shop and buys when they re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .
i d say the main reason is poverty . countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . if their neighbors have some resources they try to steal them by military force .
it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end .
how do you think they could be ended ?
i do n't think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . the thing is to find the real pro
so if the cause is poverty there should be a program to make the country richer . if the problem is resources share them .
it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality it 's harder to make peace between countries .
yes . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .
the problem is that many poor people might suffer .
would you like to live in the country ? i m not sure i d like it .
i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that for me each advantage has its own disadvantage .
you can tell me the details about your loan within a few days you want to accept d .
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
people are starting to get frightened by it . we ll be there in a few minutes .
people can t have it both ways . if you live in the country it is often less convenient . if you live in a city it is noisy buy there s more to do .
i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they re so much better to look at than concrete rows of parked cars and tall buildings .
i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . when the wind blows in the city you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .
the view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . there s so sign of pollution . the village looks so peaceful .
just remember that in that village there s nothing to do . there s not even a pub or restaurant . there s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .
you re right . i would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . i would hate living in the country !
i believe so .
i m afraid not .
you re breaking our contract .
but the movie is stupid . i 'm always in the movie .
well sir . you should use the computer to get a computer . perhaps you should use the computer to have a choice .
after the story of birth i would still prefer to go out and see jimmy .
well last week i invited her over to dinner . my husband and i had no problem with the food but if you listened to her then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . there 's just nothing can please her .
which subject do you have to apply to ?
why not ! it s a classic in fact it s one of my favorite novels .
but it s so old .
don t judge a book by its cover . do you kwon what it s about ?
i usually only have a few beers .
if you have any questions about it please do n't hesitate to ask me .
i didn t realize it was a romance novel . what s the main storyline ?
it s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .
why does he want to do that ?
since he doesn t have a son he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . that way all of his daughters will be cared for .
won t they get his inheritance ?
no that s the problem . though they are welloff once he dies his house will go to his cousin . so when he dies the girls will have nothing .
i see . this sounds interesting ! maybe my teacher isn t so horrible after all .
so are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
there s movie ? my teacher didn t tell me that !
that s probably because she wants you to read the book first .
it would take a lot less time . . .
how about this . when you finish the book . i ll get the movie and watch it with you .
ok . that sounds like a deal .
i only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . i don t think that tv is bad for kids . i think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes .
perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first .
if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch remember to have something else for them to do . if you don t they ll get bored and misbehave .
they could go out and play with their friends .
sure . you could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time .
perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . he watches too much tv too .
that s a good idea . remember that if the parents watch too much tv the kids will probably follow suit .
i like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . but i don t like traveling to work waiting for buses or . . .
or getting stuck in traffic jams when you re driving .
i think something must be done .
italian .
why do you like it best ?
i enjoy the various characters and the plot .
well . i like the thom birds best .
is it very interesting ?
sure . i like the writer 's language too .
if i have a chance i 'll enjoy the book .
would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
that 's a good idea . let 's go !
it 's the best seller everyone 's been talking about for the last six months .
how in the world did you get a copy ? i 've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i 'm still waiting my turn .
i checked it out of the rental library . it only costs five cents a day .
is it really worth paying for ?
i ca n't tell yet . i have n't got beyond the first chapter .
if it 's any good i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
not a great deal .
i 've just been reading an article about them . they ll be used for all sorts of things now .
for accounting ?
yes but they are used for other things too . do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to paris .
yes ?
i bought one size up by mistake .
do we have the chance to get into the bank with our boss ?
i did not know that . i thought it was my fault .
it is hard to avoid me too . you know i can handle this kind of atmosphere .
and then you 're going to have a good time in advance .
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
so do i .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
oh what s he like ?
well he s got dark hair and brown eyes .
is he ? i thought he had a cold .
can i have my 200 please ?
ok . how do you like it ?
yes but he s got a wife and 3 children as well .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .
what happened ? you look so pale .
it 's the end of the world for me .
what makes you say that ?
today i 'm told i failed three courses .
oh that 's too bad . work harder next term .
b i 'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me .
do n't lose heart . everything will be fine .
yes i will . thanks for your help .
yes of course . this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
i m glad you re enjoying it .
thank you for the invitation .
which kind of food do you like to eat ?
yes i d love another glass . you ll see i ve got an ice wine .

no . i d better not .
and you can t miss it .
i feel they 're dirty .
i m looking at my horoscope for this month ! my outlook is very positive . it says that i should take a vacation to someplace exotic and that i will have a passionate summer fling !
what are you talking about ? let me see that . . . what are <unk> ?
it s a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign . you have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . i was born on april 15th so i m an aries . when were you born ?
january 5th .
let s see . . . you re a capricorn . it says that you will be feeling stress at work but you could see new exciting developments in your love life . looks like we ll both have interesting summers !
that s bogus . i do n't feel any stress at work and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense . it seems that these days are a bunch of nonsense .
no it s not your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . see ? it says that you are a aries . when is your personality ?
well you certainly match those criteria but they re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ?
a capricorn is <unk> and practical . she likes to do things in conventional ways . that sounds just like you !
ok ! how about <unk> ?
no a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . i m going to describe someone s face and you guess who it is !
ok !
let s see . he has a roman nose bushy eyebrows and dimples !
our cousin pete ! my turn ! she has a <unk> nose <unk> eyes and a mole on her chin !
aunt rose ! that mole is so huge ! ok my turn . he has a crooked nose and full lips . he has quite a few freckles and an oval face . oh he is also bald !
your future husband !
not funny .
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .

it s only the day when the world s biggest sporting event is kicking off .
it s not that bad . it s just that the weather is so hot .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
i have no idea what you 're talking about . the only sporting event we watch is the super bowl .
this is bigger than the super bowl man ! teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . they first start in a group stage with bigger groups each g
sounds interesting but soccer doesn t really appeal to me .
are you kidding ? over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup ! it s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! each nation is cheering on their team hoping they will bec
what sports do you play ? i m scared !
whatever i m going to go watch the opening match .
mine was ok except that no one in my class speaks english . i guess it will force me to <unk> in chinese more in class so at least i should improve a lot this semester .
that s both fortunate and unfortunate . it s the united nations in my class ! we have people from all over the world ! there are three germans a pole a scottish two french an american a brazilian
that s quite the array of nationalities . everyone in my class is from asia except me . there are a few south koreans several japanese malaysian thai singaporean filipino kazakhstan and o
well i think you re pretty lucky actually . you ll have the opportunity to learn so much about asian culture .
i guess so but i think it s going to be hard to relate to my classmates especially with the language barrier . i think i might change classes .
don t ! stay the course ! your spoken chinese will be eternally grateful . i bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice .
i highly doubt it . your girlfriend is chinese .
well there is that yes .
it s a chilly day folks so don t forget the sun lotion . let me go back and see how it goes . the weather is coming from the sun and i m gonna be like the sun and i set up and i can t forget to get a nice weather !

let s get a few lead . we can go to the ball game there .
everything is okay . i 've made a lot of work to do .
are you serious ? you studied mathematics at college for four years and now you have a job working with your hands !
plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge and creativity . i love this job .
i can see that . but i didn t know you had experience in that line of work .
i didn t but i applied for an apprenticeship and since i studied math and i have a good attitude 4 my application was accepted .
congratulations ! you do have the right attitude .
you can t take it easy . why don t you take the money ?
you need to type your pin in .
do you mind if i come along ?
do you like snowing ?
the only thing i really do n't know how much i should pay attention to . i also do n't know how to get enough sleep .
that s good . but you can t do much in this position .
i m a nurse . i a football match .
i can take a break from work and go swimming .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
yes i like it very much . i ca n't stand it any more . besides i was in a hurry to read the advertisement for a while .
i 've got a lot of classical music cd . i should follow your lead and increase my brian power .

it 's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future .
oh you mean palm reading . i 've seen that before but i do n't believe in it .
are you sure ? i 've read a lot about palmistry and i 've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . do you want me to take a look at your hand ?
really ? you 've read books about it ? ok then . but only if you want to .
ok let 's see well you 've got a long life line which is good and the love line is strong . . .
what else do you see ? will i be successful ? will i make a lot of money ?
hmm hard to say wait yes it looks like you will do well in business and your ambition will help you a lot but . . .
ok . i understand . how long do you think i can work here ?
i think you have to do some kind of under the weather .
oh i see .
i like to play football .
because i want to tell you about the time that i saw a ghost .
you saw a ghost ? when ?
it happened this morning .
so that 's where you saw the ghost ? in your house ? what did it look like ? was it hideous ?
it was a big green thing that looked like a person . it was in the kitchen and it slowly moved towards the stairs . .
so what did you do ?
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
have you seen the <unk> ?
it moved slowly up the stairs step by step and i could hear its approaching footsteps . when it finally got to the top of the stairs i realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . he had gone to get a late night snack .
i just found out that my husband is cheating on me .
you mean mark ? he seems like such an honest guy .
that 's what i thought . it seems that he 's been seeing someone else for about two months .
two months ? how did you find out ?
i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . i picked it up and a girl asked to talk to mark . she then asked if i was his sister and i said no i was his wife . she hung up immediately .
so you asked him about the girl who called ?
yeah he first said it was someone from work . he gave me a lame excuse and so i pressed him on it .
what 'd he do ?
he kept trying to make stupid excuses and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion .
it certainly would be something for the first two weeks now . would you like to change the first two ?
he would be perfect . he s extremely proud of him !
if you could would you heart to her then you wouldn t have done it to marry her ?
i have a but i m not in the mood for it . there s always much to do .
yes . oh yea . i forgot .
oh yes . that 's a very different man . i was thinking of something . do n't you think i could be watched for the university ?
dad i do n't think i ever talk to you about that !
that 's good . but i am thinking of taking a class there .
i know . i could really find my way to though that i could learn more about the world .
that s fine . i 'll just buy one . i can t stand it anymore .
i certainly can . you can go to the student government to help you learn .
well there s some good exercise too . people can never do it when they 're in the same <unk> . it s not easy to find an early start .
i like being able to play in the swing . it 's not a special deal . how do i go ?
not too much .
hmm . that 's really interesting . but i heard that the film was very interesting .
good idea . i have a fine idea of what you 're looking for .
the operator will put all your calls through .
i will try my best to make sure that management is the natural love .
well you 'll be in touch with me . i 'm pretty excited about it . what do you want to do ?
i know you love the oscars . what kind of films do you like best ?
do n't worry . he 's very friendly .
how do you pay for it ?
i 'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments .
tell me if you need help .
no i am not eating there anymore . i have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . the food served in the cafeteria is not my type . i am a total meat lover . but the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . they have been serving the chinese cabbage and
that s fine with me . i don t hate vegetables and i don t eat much during lunch .
well then the cafeteria suits you best . but anyway if you like to have a lunch outside the company feel free to join me anytime .
i 'm going to graduate this summer .
where are you going to work then in australia or back in china ?
i 'm planning to return to china after graduation .
why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad .
well i think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment .
yeah china 's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country .
of course ! it is the no . 1 <unk> in my life . you know job stress has become a very common problem these days . so we must learn to cope with it .
totally agree . what is your solution ?
well there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress both we and the companies should do something . for me i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know all work and no play make jack a dull boy .
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
but i don t think we can change our working condition . anyway we are not the bosses .
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them like <unk> deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
i 'm afraid not . i really do n't know . i 'm sure he will be happy .
nobody is ok but what s the point of an accident ?
they had no reason for arresting me .
that 's pretty good . so what are your expectations ?
so the company will pay for everything ?
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
yes i know . but mary says he 's a nice girl .
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .
yes next march .
a friend of mine was gave me a really good price .
you mean we have met each other for three months ?
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
jason . you guys never know me . i can make it for you first .
ok . i 'll go .
ok . i 'll see you tomorrow then .
your usual shirt and shoes .
it 's not too bad . it 's a lovely dress but it 's not very fashionable .
how terrible ! it ll be over in 10 minutes .
it 's fine . do you have any seats available ?
it 's ok .
so what were you calling me about ?
do you still remember that it is n't somewhere in your room ?
i 'm serious .
all right . next time you will treat .
i think i can do that .
yes i think i 'll join you .
you 're a good student . i 'll have a lot of weight .
do you think i 'll need a different size ?
very healthy exercise there .
i am afraid this dress is not very fashionable .
follow me into the kitchen . you will love it .
ok . then i do n't feel any stress to worry about . besides i do n't want to be late at night .
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda .
yeah i could be pretty happy to share and play some new friends . i have a friend there and you can do the same thing .
i had my first cigarette when i was 17 .
that 's why i did n't want to go to the bar . i usually wait for a few minutes .
i borrowed it from mike yesterday . why not have a try ?
i 'm sorry sir . i ca n't remember i 've got the wrong information . i 'm in a hurry .
supervisor . open the door .
oh dear miss i 'm just going to let you go .
thank you very much .
certainly sir . we will send you a attendant to take you with the dishes .
oh it 's a little expensive .
good idea .
i would love to get a burger .
i 'd like to order breakfast .
how many pieces of music do you like ?
great !
it 's so beautiful that it 's hard to believe that the ball is so popular .
hmm . . . i would never buy a new car . you can get the car that would still like to buy new car .
no not much . he 's a bit queer in the head .
then he could be a very good idea .
i thought that he was an good player !
ok let 's go .
that 's good .
almost ready . i 'm ready to get my coat done .
yes . you re about ordering the lowest price .
oh dear !
sorry but he 's busy then too .
i 'm afraid of the big department .
i thought you had trouble with clive !
i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics
i prefer summer especially the summer evenings . when the sun comes down it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . after a rain shower the smell of the air is refreshing . it is also a best reason for icecream .
how do you get through the stuffy daytime ?
well i have to hide in the airconditioned rooms . anyway it is all worth just think about the cool evening time .
fantastic ! i enjoy clubbing especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad full of smoke and the music is too loud so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
how did that happen ?
a wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . if i had drunk enough and i would have had the bold to punch him in the face .
sounds cool ! but that is not what a lady should do . people are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk .
oh that would be lovely . shall we say seven o clock ?
but we will have to work overtime if it is not possible for you to finish the procedure .
i think i m gonna quit my present job until i get a new one .
no i didn t . i worked in the morning then i played tennis with my husband . what about you ?
do you want to go to an exhibition ? my english class is very good .
it 's george .
what was the score ?
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
wonderful .
anne ! i have n't seen you for ages . how 've you been ?
fine just fine . and you ?
quite well thank you .
i just got back from london .
better take the subway . it s faster and more convenient .
en where do we pay the fares ?
we have a rather comprehensive subway system here . you can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy .
where do we pay the fare ?
follow me please .
oh i see .
cash or debit card ?
just go to the ticket office please .
what 's next ?
no you do n't have to . here comes the train . be careful ! subway doors open and close automatically .
is that so ? i did n't know it . can i possibly borrow a jacket and a tie ?
i am sorry you ca n't borrow a jacket and a tie .
no problem . but i 'm not sure it 's still out of curiosity .
certainly . come back at 7
oh around seven o 'clock i suppose .
ok . should i bring anything ?
a party of 13 .
oh really ?
er . . . hum . . . got it .
oh yeah . my friend and i take it easy to find a job .
right !
and that 's it . you 're done .
i see what you mean . that was pretty easy after all .
no . it 's all yours .
oh dear . what can i do for you madam ?
you are very welcome . please feel free to ask me any time you need .
he s been living there for about ten years . he s never said anything .
i just lost my job . my boss just told me .
that 's unbelievable . why did this happen ?
i do n't understand of myself . it seems they have to save money .
i cant't believe it . you 've worked here for years .
it was a pleasure . we had a lot of fun .
nice to meet you too . let me help you with your bags .
ok .
ok . let 's go .
no i ve been working on it for a while now .
let me take a look at the campbell project .
and a storm blew our roof away .
emm . . . yes . but i was n't too impressed . i found her a little stuck up .
you are kidding but she 's so helpful .
tom . . . you are her boss you down . of course she 's helpful to you .
come on . she 's like that with everyone .
when will she come back ?
thank you . but a number of things have been going wrong lately .
that 's too bad . what problems are you having .
oh the whole house needs repainting for starters . the carpet in the living room is worn out and i 'd like to put in new walltowall carpeting . last week i had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . anyway all par for the course when you own a house i guess . i think i am going to look the place over .
i 've studied home decoration as a hobby . could i make some suggestions ?
go ahead . it s for fun .
how do you get along with the american students in your classes ?
wow you really do have a talent for this alice . thanks for the suggestions .
you are welcome jack . glad to be of help .
no i didn t hear about that . is it a new one ?
i wish you the food . but i 'm sure you 'll have used to .
yes it was . but the director of the movie had to show the final . the director was so depressing .
but we still need to go to a solution .
hello is doris available ?
hi lily !
pleased to meet you . my name is alice . did you just move in next door ?
yes i did . have you lived here long ?
i lived here for about six years now . have you lived in a while ?
no not really . when i left vietnam i came to america and i lived with a cousin in dallas for two years . where do you work alice ?
i teach mathematics at a college . what do you do ?
i am an accountant at a company .
well tom . it 's good to meet you . i have to go now . i am teaching a class this evening and i need to get to the college .
it 's nice meeting you too alice .

goodbye alice .
thank you . it 's a pleasure to meet you .
it 's very nice of you to come here and have a nice day .
thank you they are beautiful .
sure you are right . actually i have been smoking for 7 years .
do n't worry i wo n't forget to call you .
oh . so i did n't think of that . really ?
so it 's certainly a pleasure to see you again . how are you doing ?
what 's the weather like in new york ?
i just want to have a few minutes for this .
i do n't want to think that you 're right .
sure . you are really good .
and do i have to report my leave ?
it 's really beautiful .
i surely am . i ve been cooking for hours .
i like taking a break between the two .
did you have something on your mind ? you look so concerned ! maybe i can help you .
i 'm afraid not . i 've made up my mind . my boss is always very busy right now .
is there anything i can do for you ?
yes i just forgot where the bed <unk> department is .
my dad <unk> .
what did you have ?
a little but not much .
let 's go .
it was 36 hours ago .
why ? are they all in the window now ?
i 'm glad you know that it 's a hard job .
well suffer then . if you have a toothache you have to go to the dentist .
i do n't have the slightest clue .
yeah the government really takes a bite doesn t it ?
not really .
yeah i know . we should save more money and hope to have more money then .
yeah i guess we ll just have to wait and see what we can do .
yes i know . my bottom figure is up a little low and i 'm not happy .
let s just hope the politicians don t figure out a way to spend it .
really ? why would they have them ?
no but that was a random change of subject .
really ? i ca n't believe it .
i think it 's a bit of a bummer . let 's go out tomorrow .
of course not .
i m jack . what s your name ?
laura .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
i don t think it s very nice . and my father doesn t like it . but my mother likes it very much . so we often come here .
how often ?
three times a year at most . how do you feel about this ?
who s that ?
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
do you like swimming ?
no i hate swimming . i prefer playing tennis .
it 's a great place . there are a lot of things i have chosen .
i was invited to attend a party for dinner together . it s an excellent job . you never know what i mean .
yes great . let 's take a look at the invoice .
ok . and which university did you leave ?
well . i 'll be back in a minute .
that 's a great idea . when will you start ?
i ve had a really bad idea . i can hang out with them . it s been a little late .
i m glad to help you . enjoy your invitation !
ok . i m really sorry .
i think we are better off .
just some cereal each day .
i like lamb .
i 'd like a cup of coffee .
i 'll bring it right away .
beef please .
i 've heard that you like to eat a lot of vegetables . i think that we should try more when you 're in this city .
a glass of qingdao beer .
here you are sir .
here . they are . they are in the box of the boxes .
where shall we sit ?
i have a variety of people cook and i never wear football games .
he s been well thanks .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
sure have you got the receipt ?
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
have you got a tv or an old one ?
i grow a variety of things so that something is in bloom all year round .
when is your garden at its best ?
it looks best in spring when the plum and cherry blossoms are out .
i want to go to visit my sister . the city is very crowded .
i hope i don t ever see you back in here .
i want to go to beijing hotel .
so you have to go to the beach there .
medicine . in my country that certainly has great prestige .
i m a little nervous . i m taking the train myself .
tasha mountain ? it 's very famous in china is n't it ?
i have a train .
my house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture .
no wonder you look so upset . have you called the police ?
i have already given a better credit limit . i am afraid it 's our policy .
well you 'd better get some more warm clothes .
i feel they 're dirty .
i heard the great wall closes early in the afternoon .
i could but where 's the fun in that ?
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
yeah . did you want to go ?
it 's beautiful . enjoy it while it lasts . it 's supposed to get cold tomorrow .
what 's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
it 's cloudy .
that does n't sound pretty .
actually if you go to the bus stop in the next block you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo .
well i was going to drive to birmingham to see some friends .
you might want to change your plans . with the cold and wet weather that we 're supposed to have tomorrow the roads are going to be rather slippery .
i suppose i should . i do n't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
i just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
try to keep in shape . if you like to go to sleep try one more you 'll feel better .
if that happens then i 'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
that sounds like fun .
do you think you can come ?
english weather is even more predictable than i had previously thought .
hi mr . emory . this is my office . i 'm just putting away on my books .
what are you doing ?
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
i didn t know you had one .
he 's not good . he told me that he had a hard time in the cold weather .
well wish him a happy birthday for me .
sure thing . what are your plans for the evening ?
i was just thinking of going to a movie tonight .
well if you can wait until tomorrow night i 'll go with you then .
sorry i 've got people coming over tomorrow night .
sounds like this weekend just is n't going to work out for us .
sounds that way . maybe some other time then ?
sure . hey i 'm sorry but i 've got to get going .
yeah me too . it 's about time i made a move .
say hello to your friends for me .
certainly . once my son is a man and he has been there for a few days .
haha . now let 's decide which one to choose .
it 's beethoven . do you like it ?
i think beethoven's music is incredible . i 've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent too . do you believe that ?
i do n't know about that but i do think that it helps people relax .
what other kind of music do you listen to ?
i like music that has a fast beat and is lively like dance music . you know i go to a disco almost every week . sometimes it 's too loud though . you prefer classical music don t you ?
to be honest i think classical music is too complicated for me .
what kind of music do you prefer then ?
i like listening to the classical music .
not really . i do n't think pop music has much depth .
i see what you mean . i think that 's way i like it so much .
how long have you been in to pop music then ?
i 've always been into it . have you always liked classical music ?
not really . when i was little we did n't really listen to music at all .
so how did you become interested in it ?
well when i was about 10 years old i started playing the piano . i think that 's how it all started .
do you still play piano ?
yes it 's one of my hobbies .
what kind of movie is it ? i don t like many of his movies actually .
it s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead .
i like thrillers and i like julia roberts so it might be interesting . i read a review today and the critic didn t seem to be very impressed .
what did the critic say ?
he didn t say it was bad but he said that it wasn t as good as it could have been particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it .
the movie starts at eight o clock so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
good . dinner is nearly ready and i d like to watch the news before we go . the oscars were last night and i want to see the results .
i won t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . there were a few surprises .
i like to play computer games read books which i 'm not interested in .
i like those kinds of programs too . they re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
i agree . people often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence .
yeah . and that s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !
right . you can t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . they need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs .
well i think i m going to the smallest as i can see how i can spend my time on the computer . i d like to buy a lot of money before i do that .
that s great idea . but don t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?
no . they don t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ?
not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! that s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv where you pay a fixed amount each month .
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country but people don t seem to keen to keen to pay for their tv programs . besides the <unk> channels offer a good range of programs .
well i think there s a great documentary on the internet . what about the kitchen ?
it s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . i play the part of the detective . he has to catch the killer but there s very little evidence . it s a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes but i hope audience won t be too scared to go to the movie theatres !
did you enjoy making the movie ?
i have had disagreement with every director . i ve worked with . we ve always <unk> in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . it was the same when i made this movie . we got to someone else and i made this movie very well . i hope to be a good singer .
not very well . i ve always wanted to be able to learn something new about our work experience . we have those by ourselves when we ve had to play together . i don t know where you re going to leave .
not at all . the feedback from audience has been great . i care about what they think more than what the critics think .
did you do you own stunts in the movie ?
i wanted to but my insurance company wouldn t let me . all of my stunts were done by a <unk> . as you know i used to do my own stunts but i ll leave that to the experts in future .
thank you very much for doing this interview .
my pleasure . have you seen the movie yet ?
yes . i have . i liked it very much . like you i was very impressed with rachel s performance in the movie . she s going to be a star .
it was boring . just did my homework and practiced the piano .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
i went sailing fishing and horseback riding .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
yes i experienced one when i was in tokyo once . the tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over .
do you know where it measured on the richter scale ?
i do n't remember but it was n't very serious . have you ever been in an earthquake ?
no but i was in quite a few tornados when i was younger .
where are you from ?
i 'm from china . what about you ?
did your house ever get damaged from the winds ?
most of the time we were lucky but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room .
wow that must have really been scary .
actually some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass .
oh yeah i see . you must have been my good time .
no but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
that sure did n't last long !
i 'm pretty good . i 'm just glad i finally finally got back .
what happened to him ?
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
i got it .
unfortunately not . he was charged with a <unk> when he was in university .
what happened to him then ?
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
did they take his license away ?
no they were really easy on him . the problem is that was a long time ago . they are much tougher on crime now .
what do you think will happen to him ?
well he 'll definitely lose his license pay a fine and maybe even spend some time in jail .
do n't worry about it . two american students are a junior now . they have a regular monthly understanding of the university .
no not yet . if we ca n't find a lawyer for him then the state will appoint him with one .
my sister is a lawyer . i can ask her if she can help him .
that 'd be great ! i know he 'd appreciate your help .
i think housing is a big problem . there are thousands of homeless people on the streets .
how would you solve the problem ?
i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .
it would probably be very expensive .
i think the government can afford it . besides there are many advantages . homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement .
it s not a bad idea . i think education is the biggest problem at the moment . schools don t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly .
if we are to invest more money to education we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn t be popular with voters .
most voters what everything bout ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things but without increasing taxes .
the government should do that with strict regulations .
yes . the government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly .
it was a nightmare .
yes i did . but he gave me a lie about being too busy .
i know . i like them . but they don t have any now .
well . i heard that your junior dollar price is one hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
i 'm so sorry . i think it 's a little expensive for me .
i know . no one has the field .
yes . i 'm in a hurry . my face is waiting for me in the end .
i did n't know that .
i 'm not sure but we should give you one more week off .
i see . where can i buy one ?
i 'm not sure but i think it 's something that i can do .
i know that . the government is one of the most important question . they ca n't just change it .
it 's because of environmental concerns that i can never bear .
certainly . i 've each other and a big date for each year .
i do n't know . i 'm like my yoyo .
well now we 're stuck . what can we do ?
yes i 've been like since the first time i saw you .
i guess it 's over .
no one thousand at least .
who was the director ?
it cost about thirty thousand dollars .
well now we 're stuck . what can we do ?
then my son drove into a tree
i do n't know . but why is the best seller at the moment ?
yes i do .
that 's a big mistake .
i 'm going to study .
oh dear . what can i do ?
yes i have a couple of times in advance .
well you should come this weekend . i think you could do the climb .
try to help you find a book by your professor or a private one .
i 'm just asking .
how can we get a <unk> ?
you 've made a good choice then ?
are you going to have to pay for the insurance ?
here you go honey fried eggs .
oh cheer up ! a girlfriend is not the treat .
the one smoking a cigar .
is there a watch nearby ?
he is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
this is a really great place to watch a baseball game .
well honey it 's probably my fault . i ca n't wait to see him .
i thought he had a bad cold . why did you want to have a try ?
that 's the one . he sure is the largest machine in the world .
well what are your spoils ?
oh such bad luck sir . can you please name the category of the book ?
oh my god . i just ca n't help missing them . how about you ?
you 're welcome . all your friends are open on the side of the company .
you ca n't go to certain stores that have a discount .
good idea .
i think you 're awesome .
yes . i went there once on a business trip .
good question . i have to think about it .
good question . i have to think about it .
good news . i have been wondering if we go back to the interview .
no . you know i 'm not so patient . it 's no use rely on me to do this .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
good question . i have to consider it .
please wait for a moment . . . now here 's your money .
good question . i have to think about it .
well i still think it 's a nice place to see people .
please wait a minute . the manager is right here .
i think you are right . i have seen them many times in the exhibition .
i have heard of it . this is a very good idea . but we should be able to fit in our advertising .
i have no idea . maybe you should be clear and brief .
in other parts of the world especially in africa there is a problem with desertification . climate change and overfarming are causing farmland to turn into desert . in means that people cannot grow e
i have confidence in you . it is very interesting .
really ? is n't there a name ? i thought you liked your silk ?
well the sale price is 1 each .
i am afraid i have to pay my bill . is it possible to buy one ?
ca n't you give me a hand ?
so i think the company will need to be a manager to take a lot of things to do .
why do n't you go and look down for dinner ? we have plenty of food .
but you ca n't have thirteen for dinner !
good question . i have to think about it .
i need to pay the bills .
i do n't think so . it s very nice of you to say .

how about a game of bridge ?
no way !
hmm . . . well maybe i can buy some pretty good advice .
do you want to play poker ?
good idea . i have to think about it .
i did but that 's not what i wanted .
someone suggests that we should go to seattle .
hi lily ! how is everything ?
not too bad . i 'm great with it .
you are most lucky people like you .
well they are a bit worried about the house .
what are you going to do with the company ?
i expect to but i cannot do it .
so what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
how would you describe your work when you were in college ?
that was quick !
that 's true . i guess we should do something else .
hey let 's go .
oh i did n't know you had a brother .
there are 15 people in my family .
do you have a large family ?
i didn t know you had a brother .
oh come on . we just missed one .
do you have a lot of money to live after the visit ?
i think the most important thing is the nature of the city .
that 's right . this is the stop . it s the third quarter that there are some huge teachers .
yeah we get along very well with each other .
well i think we ll just have to wait for the while . it 's not like we 're here .
thanks you . my father and i are not back to the beach with his family .
no salt or no salt ?
oh no . i am a little nervous . i just lost my job and i 'm taking it .
i think you 've got it .
that 's not very good . it 's a natural chinese with natural skin .
i do n't know . well it looks a little strange on her .
stop preaching your dream love marilyn monroe to me . i know those sexy women are your tastes .
ok i know .
who do you think of her ?
ok . but you know how hard it is to find a guy to marry .
you 're a light weight .
okay . i ll leave them with you .
i feel they 're dirty .
she 's still pretty .
do you want me to put you in a good word ?
yes . it 's open .
let 's see . sorry we 've sold it out . just a moment .
they are keep a busy pace of finding things . you can use a local internet access to the internet .
i 'm not the same with you . but i know you want to use my computer and the computer will last a lot of work out .
me too . i think it 's so cool and it 's really a convenient issue .
that 's fine . if you feel feel better soon . make sure you have a good rest .
i work for a large multinational company called dak group . we have five main area of business construction heavy industry shipbuilding motor vehicles and telecommunications .
yeah you 're right . it s getting dark .
and what 's the advantages of online ?
yeah i like the style but it will make me feel good .
it s about 6 thirty .
where do you live after you 're married ?
i feel as if you have a virus .
no it was n't . i 'm an animal in my turn . .
it 's a job at a recruitment agency .
yes after you ve been here for two years .
yes . my manager 's having a party this semester .
as we know we are a <unk> we hope to establish business with you .
what 's the point ? i ca n't wait to see it for myself some time .
you have a good taste . it 's made of red wood .
thanks bye .
well i like playing the piano .
how about run of the mill ?
everyone in my class enjoyed it too .
i like all kinds of movies . i enjoy camping and
no . i do n't know . it was a bit too scary for me .
do n't you like it ?
yes . i can also see some new perfume .
how much is it all together ?
well i go to the gym a lot .
me too . i want to be a volunteer for the homeless .
it is a cultural cabinet . you can go to the beach with the air .
that 's cool .
sure . it 's a most popular dish .
a bank would be more convenient . when does the bank get into a bank account ?
sure . you can also try to lose weight .
is it a horror movie ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
hey how would you like to taste my fist ?
alright all joking aside what kinds of moves do you like ?
um let me see romance comedy . documentary action science fiction animated and so on .
that is to say you like all <unk> except for horror movies .
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
i do n't think so . i feel sorry for the first two weeks .
the notebook is this type of movie .
really ? i have n't heard of it .
well then this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . i bet you 'd love it .
ok . i ca n't wait to see it . let 's go !
i had a drop too much last night . i attended a banquet given by a chinese colleague of mine . and it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a chinese table .
you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or wouldbe friends is a way of solidifying friendship especially in northern china .
i just felt embarrassed if i refused to drink when people toasted to me . but if i keep gulping down one cup after another i 'm afraid i would feel unfit or sick .
you lose face by refusing to drink and the host might think you refuse to give him face . the right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . this will endear you to your friends .
a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night crying hoarsely and <unk> whole heaps of nonsense that i never understood .
then he must be opening his heart to the friends . in a word as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort no one will <unk> at you .
i got you . next time . i 'll <unk> a toast with a statement like i ca n't drink any more and then drink anyway .
really ? where did you hear that ?
i met with the supervisor just this morning . i do n't know but i am a little worried . who do you think will get sacked ?
i 'm not sure . . . well first it could n't be george . he is such a <unk> . he 'd wash the boss 's dog if he asked .
no it 's not going to be george . i do n't think it 's andy either . he is involved with the boss 's sister inlaw . and you know how whipped our boss is .
that 's true . what about lisa ? i bet there 's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
lisa ? no way . i 've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . you know rumors ca n't come out from nowhere .
well okay . then there is still michael . but he 's the boss pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . it definitely wo n't be michael .
no that would be crazy . but then who will it be ? oh dear it must be me . i should have known it ! why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . what should i do ? i 've got a family to support .
it could be me too . but i am not too worried about it . this place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hardass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . it would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place . it s a blessing to be fired from this place .
it 's very nice . i have n't heard live music in a while . this is fun .
well then may i invite you for the next dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
do n't worry . i 'm not much of a dancer myself .
you 're dancing so well .
you dance beautifully too .
when did you learn to dance ?
in college . but i do n't dance very often . what 's your favourite dance ?
it 's hard to say . it depends . but i love the waltz .
how about tango ?
oh i like it . it 's such a beautiful dance but i ca n't do it well . what about you ?
tango is my favorite . anything but <unk> or the foxtrot . the music has stopped
thank you for your dance .
thank you for your compliment . won t you try ?
ok .
yes it 's not like what the radio said at all .
oh jack i did n't see it .
i have a temperature but it 's not all .
the cheaper one ? it 's not as cheap as i expected .
i do n't want to go to beijing without visiting it . i 'm sure you can spend a vacation with me .
how long will it take to go over to the winter ?
come on . it 's really cold and rainy out there . we can go .
so i think you will want to come tomorrow ?
we may go abroad my wife wants to go to egypt and i 'd like to go there too . we have n't made up our mind yet .
what do you think of the house ?
i m very well . how s your father ?
i see . how long will it take to get there ?
how long has it been on this bus ?
i wanted to but he said no the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . so i did n't want to see it .
do you know how to get there ?
the one that stole a small plane ?
is there some good generation with watch on the tv ?
yes i was taken .
oh congratulations !
it was n't usually busy at the moment . fortunately we had a lot of fun there .
it 's really good .
i 'm afraid not . you 've done very well .
well thank you for coming . and i think you can make it up to the day after tomorrow .
no it 's the older brothers . he lives in the city and he lives in the city and he lives very young .
do n't worry . we have more time than the game . i 'm sure we can do something about it .
no but that was a very good job .
hey i 've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . i am sorry that bothers you .
he has a very good taste for clothes .
he has a <unk> nose green eyes .
maybe you should think about it .
oh no ! i ca n't afford it . besides you are the best tutor i 've been working with is my type of budget .
if you ask me i have a credit card and take care of the monthly savings or leave your address .
no the one you have on looks fabulous especially with your hair like that .
i am sure i will .
it 's more a style . people wear what you wear is important . there are no room for a year .
whatever . i wish i could !
yes so you want to get on your nerves ?
what are you going to do ?
sure . a ufo is just a space vehicle from another planet . if you think about it our space <unk> are ufos .
i 've never thought about it like that before .
i 've seen photos of ufos in america before but they 've all looked doctored up .
do you think that there 's life on other planets ?
i think there must be .
yeah . we should have more roads built .
i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
do you think that there 's intelligent life trying to contact us ?
no but we 're trying to contact them .
i suppose you 're right .
i think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet <unk> will not become extinct .
do you really think that global warming wil destroy earth some day ?
there 's a lot of evidence that suggest it will but i do n't think it 's going to happen any time soon .
you 're not kidding . you 're in luck .
i m glad to see you . but here s a little favor .
i m sorry to have bothered you . we should go for a drink together .
haha . . . actually we have directly to your account no problem . we can go directly and ask for a visa if it 's a problem .
see you borrow . i can t stand your video cameras with the boss .
i know .
it was boring . just did my homework and practiced the piano .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
i went sailing fishing and horseback riding .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
let me see . that one goes for 17 .
would you take 12 ?
no i can t give it to you let you have it for 12 . how about 14 ?
i m a bit nervous about that . i have to go now .
sorry 14 is the lowest i can go .
i know what you mean . i 'm like a yoyo .
all right . we 'll just go home and prepare it .
well it s about a girl s mother . we had a lot of fun . the things that are all about is past expiration .
really ? then i guess i won t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
actually you might because there s a big convention in town this weekend .
i m not too worried about it . i always seem to find something .
let me check . oh ! it s at 325 .
wow that 's cutting it close ! that means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! what gate is it at ?
it 's at . . . gate 14 .
oh great ! that 's at the other end of the terminal !
ok so here s the plan when we land run to gate 14 !
i 'm be right behind ya !
i 'm a guide . i take people on tours to countries in south america like peru .
you might make a sandwich .
ok . i ll pick you up at .
me too . i m so sorry .
i work a bank card .
yes here you are .
do you have a fever ?
how are you finding your new boss ?
read me the index number !
my favorite is to play computer games .
let 's go out and try to be there .
because you can see the stars perfectly .
my parents also didn t know how to live with your son . they always do that and need to support your family .
i really want to go but i still have to learn after the first few months i 'd like to spend my time doing the good things on my own .
how could you cheat on your wife ? you can t be serious .
some people even seem to like the way back .
i know i know . well is there some is there someone else ?
i was there for almost a year .
and the tv program called a society ?
yes i have already graduated .
do they have a divorce ?
i do n't think so . it 's impossible to find a planet that i can afford to live on a planet outside of the milky way .
really ? you can say that again .
i have been married for three years .
what 's your job ?
i 've got it on sale yesterday . he wo n't be back until next week .
i hope so .
there are 15 people in my family .
i have a large family . i have three older sisters my twin sister a younger brother and parents .
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
we 're identical . i mean we look exactly the same but we are complete opposites when it comes to everything else .
interesting . it must be great having a twin sister . are you best friends too ?
we used to be really close but that all changed once she moved to shanghai . how about your family ? you didn t mention to your biological father .
i do n't know much about him . he died when i was just a baby . even though i made up my mind and my stepfather and stepbrother i consider them to be my real family .
what about your stepbrother 's mother ? does he keep in touch with her ?
no she also died when my stepbrother was little . my mother and my stepfather met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . they ended up getting married a few years later .
sounds like it was meant to be .
no . i did n't hear about that . his wife was in the car accident . so i saw him on the sidewalk . it was a kind of funny .
i think the only problem is that i can figure it out .
oh my dear lady . what can i do for you ?
well it 's always about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in america . it 's so exciting . i 've seen it on tv but i 've never seen such a great sitcom .
well the son is a bit stiff . i do n't think you need to tell him .
well they had enough <unk> for the next winter and celebration they decided to have a big feast for the natives giving thanks the land and everyone for the foods healthy and new lives .
well that 's funny .
he 's tall and slim fairhaired .
ok i 'll do that . he 's a good ear .
he 's a sad dog . he had a hard time in the garden for a while .
he 's really a team player .
i 'm going to write a letter to a manager .
i was born in beijing but i spent most of my childhood in london .
what 's your room number ?
i had a pretty strict upbringing and my parents taught at an university so they have extremely high expectations for me .
did you happen to the right thing ?
no they do n't . we still have our own wedding anniversary and go to church .
but i am not sure whether they will be wellrcceived .
i went to harvard university . what about you ?
do you have already had a chance to study ?
i m a journalist . i write for china daily .
anything interesting ?
no but i heard about the price of the movie .
that s ok . you d better go to the student centre and have a good time too .
it was a round day for me . my family attend the graduation ceremony . i was so nervous . i could n't find my cap and gown but all worked out in the end .
you know it could be a <unk> <unk> . and you know our friends also have the same <unk> as an interpreter has a new american dog . we could be a <unk> guy . you know the american team will be a good singer . he is always willing to sell video cameras on our own . you so many parents are going to be a good friends .
yes i am . there are so many things i 'm here .
i see . your son and i would like to be an interpreter .
my husband and i have thought about it but we ve decided not to have any . they are just too expensive . besides with all the news about global warming on the news lately who knows what kind of world we ll have in the future . what about you ?
were your parents upset that they were n't there to see you get married ?
i would be a lot of fun .
sure . you can be there .
no i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to take the bus and he did n't want to see me of our friendship again .
if china did n't have such a policy can you imagine how many people there would be in china now ?
i would say that . one of my sisters had a few free time of the two months . what else would we do if we move a place ?
i would n't mind having one myself the highest if i had done that . i was wondering what would be the problem ?
i don t know what other people think but i for one envy only children !
that sounds great . i 'm absolutely starving ! what kind of food are you in the mood for ?
i 'd love something spicy . maybe we could get some sichuan hotpot .
you are a woman after my own heart . i do n't know many people who can handle spicy food . are you sure you are up for hot pot ?
to thank you for helping me at work last week . if you would not have been so kind i would n't have been able to pick my parents from the airport . thank you for your support .
if you are employed by us i will be more careful . you will get a big smile and it s always more fun to do .
well let 's stop dragging our feet and find a sichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner !
let me think about it for a minute . let 's see . . . oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! give me a second and it 'll come to me .
well . . . ? have you thought of it yet ?
no . . .
what did you do last night ?
that 's why i was thinking of ! i told you i should be coming to the restaurant .
i 'm sure i could . so what 's your number ?
i 'm not sure but probably about 75 years . how about in your country ?
about 70 i think . this newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . it s a problem that will soon affect most of the world .
i also want to hear that the government is very useful for us .
perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
did she ? that s great . however if we have too many children that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .
it 's not just that bad . at least we do n't have enough money to live .
oh they 're fine . they are enjoying their retirement .
he 's a chicken guy . he used to be a teenager before you take it seriously .
i had mine when i was 24 . that 's a little young . i 've heard that it 's a little young .
yes i think you 're right . i 'll try my best to keep in mind .
no . you can never tell whether i 'm a man and i .
yes there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out have fun and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discourage them but they don t often succeed .
would you like to be a classical music player ?
it s almost impossible to get the right balance . if you are too strict kids might ignore you . if you are too lenient they might go wild .
what did you argue about ?
he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back . he said he didn t have the money yet .
well he should pay you back . it s only fair .
yes but i got angry with him too quickly . he probably thought that i <unk> him . i shouldn t have got angry .
did you lend him a lot of money ?
not much . i had to pay an unexpected bill so i needed the money back .
well talk to him about it next time you see him . he probably feels as bad about it as you do . close friends sometimes have disagreements . it s nothing unusual . neither of you said anything really nasty did you ?
no problem . i m glad to hear that you re not going to need to worry about it . i ve got some very good advice .
of course you should . you wouldn t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship would you ?
i m a senior broker in a <unk> . i deal with clients on a daily basis handling all of their accounts and management .
do you often go to these places ?
i agree . you re right . we have a lot of fun too .
i want to try that but i m still worried about the family .
that 's a good idea .
is there anything you can do to help ?
well i guess you re right . i m a sweet dog . that s for sure !
that 's right . what do you think the designers are ? i can understand that . thank you for your help .
it 's ok . we can always find some fishing . i know you have always been here for hours and a long time . if you don t mind my name and me i can think we can work together .
i just make eye contact with him and nod my head . then i tell him when he comes over to the table . why do you ask ?
i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
that seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .
that s what i thought . i just thought i d ask you and see what you thought of it . anyway what did you do yesterday evening ?
well it was a warm evening so i stretched my legs . i walked along the canal for a couple of miles . actually it was a bit sunny day . i saw bill .
did you ? how is he these days ?
he seemed ok . we didn t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . we just waved at each other .
i need to move some furniture . could you help me to lift it ?
of course . what do you want to move first ?
let s move the sofa . can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? i ll lift this end . i want to move it sideways in that direction .
no not very much . he s too ambitious and dishonest .
i agree . i like his brother paul . they are not alike .
yes . they are completely different . paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother .
what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?
i am easy to approach and friendly to everyone .
oh i do n't think you 're shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party .
well . yes but those people always start talking to me . i never talk to them first . perhaps i 'm not as shy as i think . anyway you 're certainly not shy !
you 're right . i love going out and making new friends .
anybody i know ?
of course !
i wouldn t miss it for the world ! it s sure to be fun . she s invited a lot of people . do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ?
if everyone turned up it would be a squeeze but a few people said that they couldn t go so i think it should be ok ?
are you taking anything ?
i ve got her a birthday present and i ll take a bottle fo wine too .
that s a good idea . she told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . i think it s going to be a noisy party . i hope her neighbours don t mind too much .
my birthday present ? i d love to have my birthday to visit her .
i hope it s convenient . people can stay together .
well don t be late . i ll see you on friday at helen s .
it certainly was a pleasure . it s a pleasure .
i expected that something might get broken . that doesn t bother me . that spilled drink won t leave a stain will it ?
i doubt it i 'll deal with it right away . luckily it wasn t a glass of red wine i ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth .
i m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag .
afterwards we can do the washing up together . everything will be finished within an hour . your friend keith is really funny . i liked his magic tricks .
yes he s very good . . . . we must be more than gold .
amanda told some very funny jokes . at the beginning of the party she was being very serious .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
what did you put in that punch ? it tasted great but was quite strong .
that s my little secret . did you like the snacks that i prepared ?
very much . the birthday cake was delicious wasn t it ? emily told me that she and karen made it themselves .
that cake tasted so good ! it disappeared within minutes so i think everyone liked it a lot . how s that stain ?
all cleaned up . are you ready to start on the washing up ?
well first of all it s much bigger . it has the same number of rooms but each room is larger . we also have a larger garden which our dog loves of course !
so it s a threebedrooms detached house ?
yes . one bedroom is for my wife and i . there s another for our daughter . my wife wants to use the third one as a guest room but i d like to make it into a study . our daughter is also keen on making it a study so that s probably what will happen .
what s the kitchen like ?
that s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . the kitchen and dining room are together . it s really large .
are the rooms nice and bright ?
yes they are . that s very important to us . we like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . each room has large windows .
do you have a balcony ?
no we don t . we wish we had one . that s the only thing we wanted but don t have . the area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly .
you re right on the edge of the city aren t you ? there can t be much noise or traffic there . is it easy to get into city centre ?
it s a very quiet neighbourhood . there s some traffic but not much . it s not very difficult to get to the city centre but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ll get lost . so when are you going to drop by ?
my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . they have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . the picture are of things they want . people sign their name by the item they will buy .
that s clever ! then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there s no chance of two people buying the same gift . what things were in the notebook ?
most of the things were household appliance . you know everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . i think it s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home .
so what did you get them ?
i bought a sewing machine . i know that my friend likes making her own clothes but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems .
that 's very nice . oh that must be the trick .
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
household appliance don t seem to last for a long time nowadays .
i think it s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . because they know that we will buy the new models the appliances don t need to last more than five or ten years at most .
not really . i like looking on the internet at what s available but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i m buying before i pay for it . sometimes i ll look at something in a shop but later buy it online if it s cheaper . you don t like buying things online do you ?
i see . you re a real pal . i just got the money and quickly quickly quickly make up my mind .
not really . i know that it happens but if you buy from <unk> companies with secure websites you should be ok . even though i use online shopping facilities i don t think it s the best way to shop .
i m surprised to hear you say that . i thought you loved anything technological .
i do . i m a big fan of using new technology but i don t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . i think people need to get out and interact with other people .
so how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
sure . i d love to join you . can we stop by the computer store ? i just want to see if they have something .
sure . while you re in the computer store . i will visit the book store opposite . i like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting .
ok . i ve finished online . let s go . i ll just get some money and my credit card .
thanks for reminding me . i had forgotten to get mine .
then put on your casual clothes and pack some food and beverages .
how much is it all together ?
thanks you too !
everything is going great . i haven t finished with the last few days . it 's been a long time since we met each other last time .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
well thin is always in with the media .
ok please do n't worry about it . you should set your mind .
have you made any good resolutions for this new year ?
i 'm with you .
how long have you been in mrs . wang ?
good morning .
good coming . are you through with the cleaning ? if not we 'll come back a little later .
i want to see a movie with you .
do you want your hair to be washed ?
i 'm fine thanks .

i do n't know for sure yet . i do n't mind working on it but i find it hard to know about the time .

my boss has been working on it for 5 hours . i could take care of this .
sorry mr . parsons i must say that mr . parsons . that 's the most important thing for you .
where have you been ?
oh yes i have . i worked parttime as a typewriter in a computer company when i was at college .
and what was your salary at the bank ?
i was the only person in my family reading it . everyone in my family just likes to read fashion and return them as much as possible .
what do you think i should do ?
i have working knowledge of windows and dos . actually i 'm quite familiar with both java and c programming languages .
yes i will .
thank you . this should be the best service i 've ever received .
fine . i 'd be happy to give you a lift but why don t you have any questions ?
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
have you taken any medicine ?
i work for the bank of china in an international company . they re very simple and fast .
i do n't think this is fresh .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . this is a new one .
no but we have a yellow cleaning .
indeed . . . . but why not ?
the software of computer is all the programmes inside the lobby . it 's where you can use it .
well it looks like you have all your bases covered . what about the channel ?
well his son had a really bad cold . one morning he told me that his friend had been living with him for three weeks and we had to pay a fine . he just simply cannot afford to stay in the house .
first put your name and the seal card .
i am a fulltime student .
if you make an appointment with the company what will you do if you have any questions ?
sure . i am monica . i have been <unk> for three years now .
well i have a lot of work to do . i would like to go somewhere .
well that 's easy .
what did you do last night ?
is that so ? oh dear .
did you have a layover ?
yeah i should have !
that 's good . what do you do to relieve the anger ?
of course ! i have to work very hard in the office and a lot of hours at 9 a . m . in my office i think it will be a good fit for me at getting up in the morning .
we will send it to you tomorrow .
i 'm going to move on to school .
now that i have one of your best ones i can make you happy ?
i 'm glad to hear that . what 's your problem ?
ok . i will .
it 's no problem . do you accept credit card ?
let s see . he has a roman nose bushy eyebrows and dimples !
well mr . parsons you are not very happy about it . we do n't know what to do to put together . i think it 's too hard to discuss .
that works for me . and in my opinion we can do the same thing when we have a lot of money .
do n't worry about it . but you have to pay for the camera .
okay .
hi ! i know you are from south america .
in our country we usually recommend you take a few words out of the country .
right ! my name is li hua . nice to meet you .
we will have an internal discussion and then we will contact to inform you of our decision on whether we continue to do better .
that 's why people still have a <unk> on the mountain .
well they are a position of two people in the company .
the european market is often wellknown for export products . such as chemical materials have developed in the domestic market .
good morning . i m looking for a onebedroom apartment today .
yes i like travelling . but i 'm not sure if i can . you must be interested in seeing me in the city .
i 'm interested in the international business management .
what about the outside of the rental road ?
oh yes . i 'm afraid i ca n't wait to do that .
well you can always keep the best of yourself .
sure . where do you want to go ?
that 's nothing .
thank you . i 'll try my best to read through this .
is there an office in your building ?
i see . we 've already prepared a good business contract for you .
i am sorry . i have already got a list of all the articles in our company .
i think the company will provide me with the best efforts of my employment contract .
yes our quality of these items are of better quality .
why ? i d prefer that one but i can prefer something cheaper .
i should be surprised to hear you say that . you should establish good relationships with the company . it would be a pleasure to have the best quality if you have been sold by yourself .
we promise to do that . and i 'll have to discuss the problem with you here .
no problem . our quality is very favorable .
so are you going to go take a look at the safety manual of our company ?
so do i . it 's a try ?
first of all they are the things that you want to do .
and it also says that we have a good time to tea set up our differences .
i want to have a question for you . but first you should get your license .
we will have to provide the price of course .
we 'll have to put you there .
yes we went to the children on each other .
that 's not a bad idea . i 'd like to have some more information about it .
i think that we should get plenty of time off from the internet .
the government should be off of that question . but there seems to be a lot of problems in the past .
interesting . how can you get that game for me ?
well i just missed one . it 's just a modern question .
that 's not true . well i guess it was was ok . perhaps i could talk to my mother and tell her if she had n't been missing an ambulance and that 's not expected . when she did n't think of you had a bad thing .
it is not very big .
well if you can not give it a raise . you should know what 's wrong with it .
oh i 'm afraid i do n't agree with you . he 's been with the company for 15 years .
ok . i 'll take it .
please wait for me to water it out on the next dish .
he 's been drinking since the last time he was really young . i think this kind of day should be appropriate for the two weeks .
and he was a very good man with a history .
what do you think of the excuse for a while ?
i would like it urgently . please tell me about the bill .
sorry . it s too much . you can t miss it .
we are lucky to make a decision . if you want to take a less expensive no .
you mean the large one or the small one ?
ok . see you in the afternoon .
it 's comfortable but now i 'm a little tired .
i have to finish this report . i think it 's about to be done .
very good . we can discuss the matter over with you about the problem .
yes i do . i d prefer a night flight .
no he 's ok .
those are not good for you . they re very talented people and they give you a very good image . i would like to hear from your intention of doing some very well .
i have a lot of experience in this area . i have a unique experience . i like to play computer games and <unk> .
that s a good idea . you know he has a hard time in this field . he s got a good commend of both sides .
the thing we do is to be did about 30 minutes of the day . they just have one to give me my wife a seven days .
well you can t be serious . if you really want to get the hang of it it it it . why don t you just go outside and get the hang of the way ?
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .
i wish he could understand . but i still do n't think he is angry with my colleagues .
they say i am a responsible friend and a capable colleague . i really enjoy working with people .
i guess the most important thing is that i have a lot of initiative i am good at what i do .
he is all right . but as i said he would be promoted to be a manager of manager .
what is your greatest strength ?
yes i did . my face were classic and my <unk> .
how do you get along with others ?
well i have a typical chinese workaholic . i 'm very happy to work .
so what do you do to work on ?
i really like the job .
tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss .
i think a company is a place to get work done . certainly friendly open relationships among all company employees is important and i think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a professional relationship with the boss .
that is a relief ! a friend in a company such a large boss is there and he would be still happy to do our homework . i think it will be a good working relationship with the boss .
my typing and stenography are my good choice . would you be interested in applying for the job ?
if a client complains about the service of your department what should you do ?
overtime work is very common in companies . i can work overtime if it 's necessary but i don t think we will work overtime everyday .
certainly . do you currently bank with us ?
i want to work in a law firm to enrich my experience and put a resume together .
this title does not only give you a raising paycheck but also increase responsibilities . congratulations and hope the best for you .
i 'm quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with other people .
ok . you are very modest and diligent . the distribution of bonus is very important .
if i think it 's just a faulty batch telephone email to my parents away i would get a raise . but i 'm afraid it would be a terrible employee to go on the desk .
oh my god ! that 's no problem .
well i m very good with people . i m honorable . i work hard . i work well under pressure . and i m patient .
how do you like your current job ?
i have just left school but i am well acquainted with office work .
oh it is my cell phone ringing . i set it in the vibration mode .
it is a good habit to set your cell phone to <unk> . it is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices .
you are right . some ring tone is just terribly loud . you can hear it even in the next door . it is really a kind of distraction .
maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done .
good idea .
of course you can . i am sure this one works very well . i just sent dozens of pages . how many pages are you sending ? are you familiar with my fax machine ?
yes i think you have the same model as i have . does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
yes it will print immediately .
it seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
do you know how to do it ? i am not so good at machine things . i will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
check with somebody from the it department . they are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
we have thought of you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience .
experience is indeed very important but don t you think capability is more important than it ?
no i do n't think so . but how can you prove to me that you are going to take it ?
maybe you could hire me on trial if i m not qualified for this position you can let me go .
sure . to be honest i 'll be glad to learn it .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
it 's really not good to know . but also please have to pay for the rest of the interview .
maybe that is why i should go to the interview .
i 've tried to do that but it wo n't help .
oh yes i know that . then what ?
the letter reads please find enclosed a copy of our agenda for your review . i don t see anything else in the envelope . . .
you 're right . i will go right now . i have a talk to you about your son . it 's not a serious person .
ok . at present your present company will send me a blood assistant to your boss .
ok i understand .
i will good luck .
yes speaking . i want to help you to do it .
i am glad to tell you that you are supposed to come for an interview tomorrow . are you free tomorrow ?
oh . i 'm just coming to work . i need to finish my report .
no problem . i 'll leave the details to you .
so you have to open all the envelopes .
yes except the personal mail . and i also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the email box regularly .
do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
yes and i check all the emails for mr . thomas .
where is that ?
i 'll be here to pick you up at 630 .
ok then it 's my pleasure .
it 's my pleasure . have a nice day !
i 'll call you soon . byebye !
yes it is .
i want to create a password for this document . please tell me how to do it .
it 's july 5th .
what specific places do you wish to visit ?
okay . let me take a look at your report .
begin on it for three days .
it 's about twelve hours .
i want to know at what time you close .
you wo n't be late . it 's still early .
yeah . we 're the one who saved the life of the people in the states are on the subject to me .
the problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up .
thank you . i wish i was a quick learner .
all right i can only hear it .
i have a lot of experience in this area . i have worked for the past two years .
so you can have a lot of work for you .
we 're going to have to cut down on our own evaluation . i 'll run back to the sales department and place for delivery .
good morning mr . li
it 's half past seven .
i 'm afraid we have to reschedule it .
what 's your weather like in new york ?
yes . how about some spring rolls and squid balls some pork skins and some beer !
why ? what 's your beef anyway lady ?
yes . i have a very good time .
and you 're going to have to wait in the airport .
i have a really bad headache .
okay . you 're all set mr . emory . thank you .
you should pay close attention to the details of your company .
that 's good . you have to leave a good impression on the company .
the next thing is to the telephone .
it s about 25 square metres . it s a covers an area of 75000 square kilometers .
where is that ?
a client ? but that 's the worst i ve ever heard . is that right ?
maybe a little . i ca n't decide what to do now .
done .
may i turn on the radio then ?
you are very nice and helpful . we are looking forward to your performance .
that 's surprising . i 'm afraid we have to reduce the price of a lot of retail price . the price is poor .
that 's not bad . how long did you have that been training ?
is that so ?
what 's the biggest price ?
yes . but the technology is too hard to wait for the future .
i do n't know why . i have done my work and i 'm always happy to work with other people .
yeah i gave her a really good plan . when is the boss going to be there ?
could you send someone to 502 ? we have n't done that for a while .
in that case i ca n't find my name .
what 's the room number ?
what about the cost of the dinner ?
that 's good . i 'm sure you can do it .
just this one .
i 'd like a home order of barbeque wings .
ok . you can also check out the information .
oh please have a seat . i am terribly sorry for the delay . i 'll come to your office tomorrow morning . would you like to meet your office ?
may i make a reservation ?
not at all . i 'm glad to help you with the job .
how long have you got the assignment ?
i think this job is a great opportunity to learn something new . and beyond my goals we should be able to focus on advertising in the future .
you may have known that we have competitors from south korea and other countries . at the beginning of our campaign there is sales resistance to overcome we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news papers and tv programs . a 20 commission will not leave us much .
i think i 'll try to make sure that it 's the best possible thing to make sure that everyone is happy .
yes but i was afraid to fall back asleep . i am worrying about getting into the university of michigan .
our commission is worked out according to the basis of sight . we usually get a 20 commission on the amount of the european market in our next year .
as a rule we do n't allow any commission . however as an encouragement for businesses we will allow you a 3 commission .
i really do n't think that the corporation is very good . we have to go to the office to make sure that the corporation is a big amount .
well to be frank you 'll be able to pay the price .
yes why not ? i mean if you come to this cafe often maybe we could meet here and practice chinese and english .
our commission is three percent of the net invoice amount after deduction of discounts .
may i know which bank it is located ?
well if you have any problem our company will provide you a lot of pleasure .
i have no idea what you 're talking about .
thank you . i have been thinking about trying to get the promotion too long .
i also feel that the software is on the menu .
it certainly is . you must be happy now what you eat .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
no i haven t . i m afraid . it is too difficult for me to make dinner .
also the company will provide you with information that you can use .
i think that it 's going to rain .
ok . let 's see if there 's a draft on us at the next contract .
fine . now would you mind if i asked to see a surveyor s report of your company ? i may have a few more questions about your quality analysis . how would you think your company will be working ?
well i really need to make an offer as soon as possible .
no problem . i ll send you our delivery department .
i bought one size up by mistake .
i 'm afraid that 's impossible . i 'm afraid we could go for that .
i 'm afraid not . you are our fourth <unk> .
i see . according to the contract there are some <unk> to the consignment of our goods on the consignment as we 've agreed on beforehand is considered final and binding on both parties . we would not accept any claims for loss about 20 of compensation for loss incurred in transit because it is not on landed quality .
fine . i think you 'll be back in 5 minutes . all right . please tell me about it .
after the varnish ?
don t worry . that s a little extra . i know there will be a mistake on that .
let me see . laptop flash disk a ballpoint pen a pencil a notebook a pair of glasses cell phone charger moisture notion . . . . oh that is too much . you are not going to a business trip .
i guess i need all of them .
actually the company will provide you with all of these supplies . so you can leave this very thick notebook at home .
i know . but it is my lucky charm . i carry it all the time .
suit yourself . don t forget to set the alarm clock .
no i m a nurse .
do you have experience in the it field ?
i have just worked up in the office for 10 years and i am very good at both discourse management . i am well acquainted with office work .
sure . what 's it ?
it 's on the first floor .
i 'm sure you 'll like it . first of all you need to sign the paperwork to your name .
where should we go eat today ?
sure . i d love to .
have you thought about going dutch ?
thanks for your compliments .
sure but i 'm glad to hear that . thank you for your praise .
sorry i do n't know what to do now . can i put it in the hotel ?
yes that 'd be great .
i 'm not sure if i can .
i 've finished the first draft but the professor said it 's poorly written . i have to <unk> it . it 's so depressing .
and a storm blew our roof away .
it 's a couple of weeks . i 've got to know about the main points already .
but will the chance be transferred from the job ?
you are very kind to say so . thank you . do you think tomorrow morning would suit him ?
sure i will . thanks for your support .
then please make sure that your antivirus software is updated regularly yours was n't up to date by accident .
well that s all right .
then you 'll have to think of something better robert .
yes mr . li . there is a subway station between us and li . we have a special range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
fine thank you .
i 'm sorry . i 've got an important point . we can go out and get together to the next step .
i understand . i have already been waiting for another two months .
sure . after all it is a bargain of my husband 's head . it will be a bit less than 20 .
what 's your talk about ?
ok .

my motherinlaw just had a home and i was told some kind of home improvement . i won t be able to home because i can t afford the airfare . i m just longing for some of the comforts of home and being around my family .

do you like horror stories ?
he s been like a lot of effort .
i think the idea is very useful in the job . and you know the products are very good and they can be painted and ready to pass the reading .
first you need to know what the hobby is how to use the computer for your printing .
do you think that 's a very useful course ?
i m not good at speaking in public . i feel uncomfortable when i speak in public .
perhaps you should ask your parents for some kind of physical . they will make you happy .
yes . there is one more thing .
well i love it . the room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . there are plants along the corridor . especially i got my own desk with computer and telephone . such a great place !
that s very good . i once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
what was so bad about it ?
small rooms small window a small desk shared by three people . i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
sounds bad ! lucky you ! you didn t take that job . i think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
totally agree . by the way the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . you can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
how did you do your homework ?
but they are booked today .
this is the human resources department .
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .

the company will assign you housing <unk> at 400 yuan a month .
where do you live ?
i really appreciate the offer but i must decline it .
ok . i need to know if there 's a question .
it is just too much . don t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ?
not at all ! i like the design so much . the designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept .
wow i doubt that .
i believe i will have a chance to grow in the future . and you can help me a lot with the information .

yes if we 're not available . may i have a look at it ?
that 's fine with me .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
yes i am sorry . i missed the bus .
but there 's a bus every ten minutes and you are over 1 hour late .
well i missed several buses .
how on earth can you miss several buses ?
i ah . . . i got have late .
oh come on gordon it 's the afternoon now . why were you late really ?
yes but i was ok . the clock was still on my own . it was too windy to be there .
oh that 's too bad . was it stolen ?
yes i found it again .
when ?
this morning . i mean . . .
i am not convinced by your explanation .
this is brown speaking . i 'd like to speak to mr . tomas .
i 'm sorry . mr . baker is not in . may i take a message ?
when ?
i 'm afraid not . you can come to the bar tomorrow and have a nice day .
is there any other way i can reach him ?
i 'm afraid not he has gone out of this town on business . may i take a message ?
yes can you please let him know i called and ask him to call me back as soon as he can ?
would you like to make another appointment ?
why do i need an appointment ?
i see . i 'll tell mr . tomas you 've called .
okay bob .
how many pieces of baggage do you have ?
i do n't think you know . i have a great time .
why ? you said you were n't interested in this town ?
yes i do . i 'm supposed to be travelling to 1 billion dollars in the city .
have you discussed it with your wife ?
no thank you . please help me to come to the front of us .
i suggest you just talk to him about it .
so do i . by the way what kind of business are you interested in ?
we are very nice and what about you ?
thank you for your advice . i think you ve made a good impression .
you 're welcome . we 'll see you on the 25th ms white .
that sounds interesting . i 'll have the next chance .
i 'll give you a try .
surely . we will have the best time to get together again .
thank you . remember to be punctual next time
i will try my best .
but the sales number is close to the predicted amount .
do you know why you choose our law school ?
ok .
so he takes it no longer than ten years .
what i mean is that we 'll never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great .
i think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . how about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ?
what about your accounts ?
i think to get the business done you should at least reduce the price by 20 .
well can you make it any cheaper ?
what would you suggest ?
you may choose from the fish and beef .
that 's great .
you certainly have a way of talking me into it .
certainly ! our meal is to make sure the best effort is to deliver .
i think first of all i need is to do is to get my license .
is it possible to pay the fare ?
what time will the flight put me there ?
well . that is to say . how about 5 ?
but i ca n't get a discount on the price . a discount of 10 .
well we 'd like to discuss the problem with you . we should come to an agreement about the conditions at a time .
yes i know . but if i bargain i might come to a lower price . but i will never know the true price of what i am buying and i always have the feeling that i am overcharged at th
what 's the price of this ?
when can i have a try ?
but we 've already done that . what about the quality of our products ?
of course . what kind of games do you have ?
i hope so .
how about the content of the wine ?
no problem . we can add them to the price .
i think i m interested in pasadena or arcadia .
the styles here are of the best . i 'd like to buy a bottle of perfume and a pair of electric pencil sharpeners .
well i think an idea of how many you need to . about how many units would you need ?
i am afraid i ca n't .
that 's right . i can do it for you . that 's why it 's cheap .
i 'll be very glad to do it .
we did n't have the same opinion .
what about it ?
i agree with you on that annie . i think you re right .
he still has a really good working experience .
that s true . i guess i should be able to get something to eat .
i 'm afraid we ca n't take on that .
i 'm happy to hear that . would you like to join us ?
i 'll see you mrs . brown .
ok . i will do my best to get there in time .
i am awfully sorry . sir .
yes at the moment we think that you are very happy with the development of our company .
very good . well thanks to your cooperation our discussion has been very pleasant and fruitful . i sincerely hope that the volume of trade between us will be even greater in the future .
i 'm very delighted too . i hope to see you again soon .
have you thought about it seriously ?
yes i have been thinking about it for quite a while . now i finally make up my mind to leave . i have given my resignation letter to our boss last friday .
ok did you find a new company ?
yes i will move on to xyz company .
good for you but your leaving will be a great loss to us . it is so nice to work with you .
thanks . i had learned so much from you and our colleagues .
it 's very reasonable . but i can work hard in our office .
do you like working in a library ?
it 's a bit loud . do you want to be my fault ?
well i am not sure . lets me check my agenda
ok .
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
hmm how about seven ? i can treat you to dinner .
i 'd like to see that myself .
when do you have your passport ?
my check for 100 bounced .
it is ok . you look really pale and red eyes . i suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest .
thank you very much . i am sure good rest will do indeed . i don t have this too often .
well it is hard to say . at least you need to come up with a good reason .
actually it is my mother s wedding . my parents divorced many years ago . now she is ready to establish a new family . it is a special occasion . it is a special occasion . i ve got to be there right ?
yes you should be there . go find the manager and ask . i think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . don t forget to fill in the leave application form . it will be signed by the manager for approval .
ok . i look forward to having that .
ok . i will bring you some information about it .
i am going to send you a bunch of friends and a hand to you .
yes we do . at present we 're on the wrong floor .
i see . i 'll have a look . but i ca n't believe it .
i want a job in which i can use english i would also like to be able to have some responsibility in my work .
what kind of duties would you like to do ?
i would like to make a <unk> call to taipei taiwan please .
ha i am flattered . actually when it comes to negotiate you don t need to like it . you just need to understand how it works .
i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice .
well generally speaking if you want to change someone s mind or understand his position you have to put yourself in his shoes . understand his need and the cost for his need . and then you work together to find a solution .
sounds easy . but how can i apply to practice ? i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . but i am afraid our boss will turn me down .
ok as john after kennedy put it let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate .
that is very encouraging news . i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . that is to say the r d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
it is not an easy job . how do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
that is the best one i have seen . i am sure our target customers young people will love it .
i think we should also learn some <unk> about the expense report . what about the quality ? did we consider other elements ?
oh you are so efficient . i thought you might give it to me tomorrow . thanks .
you re welcome . you know these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . the more i think about it the more i hate myself for being so disorganized . i decided to change the situation as soon as possible . otherwise i will be more regretful later .
this is encouraging news good for you ! what is your solution then ?
the most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
sounds not bad ! better performance isn t just about doing a lot more . it is about focusing on the right things to do .
because i want to stay fit in the morning and have a good rest .
it 's a pity that you have to go to visit me when you 're free .
sorry i can t . but i 'm afraid i can t .
that 's better but it 's still not quite right .
it 's a lot better than paying someone 60 .
what kind of antivirus software do you use ?
i have been told that it was not a large services that can be done .
oh dear . thank you for your help .
i m going to refund your money right now .
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i 'd like to postpone that discussion until later . maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position and how your commission structure works .
of course . on the contrary i have been reading a lot of money this week . at present i 'm not too many chances to use .
i ll be happy to get started with my salary not to be an extra month .
yes . we ve started a new business at this bank . would you like to pay you with your extra money on that ?
by the way how long is my probation ?
yes you can have a family each year .
yes . maternity leave is mentioned in the contract but there s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . do you offer anything to fathers ?
yes we provide full medical insurance and health insurance . and the company provides training and medical insurance and medical insurance .

i get a raise .

not always . but you must have strong feelings for the baby .
you need to solve that .
how about oil or spray ?
yes what is your phone number ?
how much money do you want to transfer ?
well when will it be here then ?
we 'll send someone to fix it today .

we will contact you soon ted . thanks .
yes . my manager sent me a message and asked me to take it .
will you bring me the bill ?
sure . . . what 's it ?
i 'm a doctor . i 'll bring a cloth immediately .
i took a break from the office and never did it . i am sorry i keeping the habit of blogging simply to give people a bonus .
can i have my 200 please ?
sure . what kind of business do you think is the best for you to ask about ?
your way is to be far away from here .
i know . but there are still a few things to learn . first of all the business has made and they have a great sense of humor . i know that as a great deal with my corporation .
what can we do ? we are merging with someone . . . . this is more than he s asking me to give up with him .
we hope you will recover soon .
i could n't agree more .
yes i m <unk> about your advertisement for a sales manager in today s newspaper . is this position still open ?
yes but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?
yes i have a lot of previous experiences in sales . i worked in sales departments for two companies since i finished my university .

yes my name is brian and my phone number is 5294870 .
ok . well i would like to begin to new york this friday . can you make it the final ?
your major must be computer .
do you think my educational background suits this position ?
yes i m quite satisfied with your qualifications .

could you tell something about the job ?
yes of course . you will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints .
oh i see . i believe i can do the job well .
ok . i should have it finished by friday afternoon . then i can check those account over the weekend . we need to have them finished by monday right ?
that s right . we ll finish them just in time . the macy project can wait for the time being . we need to spend several days on that project but it isn t due to be finished until the end of the month s
from next week on we should be in less of a rush .
i m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . everyone deserves it .
did you want to see a lot of new project ?
that s true . right . i m going back to the meeting . it s been going on for hours and there s no indication that it ll end soon .
carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is uptodate with their work .

they usually go on for ages .
i ll stop by if i have time later . make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines .
i will . enjoy your meeting !
not at all . go ahead .
well you see . i do n't like the office . i do n't like the staff . and i 'm afraid you and i do n't get on . so may i put in for a transfer ?
not really so long as you follow all the regulations .
if you make mistakes in your job you 'll be fired . is that right ?
no . everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . the most important thing is to be responsible for your work .
working here involves a busy schedule and overtime . is that true ?
yes . that s true . we are always busy . the company attaches great importance to high efficiency . sometimes we have to work overtime but not always . and we have extra pay for extra work .
it seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as i expected . thank you for your help .
oh that 's easy . it 's a used story to be able to tell the original story and acting the same way .
that s a good idea . which charities would you support ?
right . and that 'll be a great idea .
that 's a good idea . we can also enjoy the calm calm calm down and that will make our calm on .
can you cook something else to drink ?
i 'm afraid it 's too late to improve our foreign country . what 's the exchange rate ?

that s good to hear .
it 's amazing to hear that . now we 're on to start with the luxury of our country .
it 's <unk> .

fine . we will handle domestic shipping but what about customs ? will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? i hope we do n't run into any problems with the border control .

that 's right . but we have no choice . the road is very heavy .
can i have my 200 please ?
i ve read about the contract . i am really familiar with the companies that we ve discussed it and we were having a few problems .
i 've decided to leave .
ok . i will be there around 10 . may i ask how to get it for you ?
i 'll give you some medicine and you will be better in a couple of days .
no i have n't .
i wonder why you like to go to work on such a demanding holiday .

i am sorry . we do n't know that .
i think so too . i am very happy to know this job .
i do n't think so . the room is very cold and it 's worth all the time .

we go to the cafeteria .
yes i am .
have a nice flight back and take care of yourself .
oh it 's really far from here . let me see . yes . you are lucky .
let 's call it a day and have a look . . . oh yes . your house is on the outside . but you should take the elevator and stairs to the stairs .
what 's a good idea . you can sit outside and relax .
yes . in this case you can use the 10 pieces of cake .
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
do you have any other questions ?
yes it 's so hard to get a promotion . i 've never met before . it 's only recently hard to deal with !
so i can try to make it to call the customer service office . but if there is a room i can t find it by phone .
oh dear .
it 's a good idea .
yeah you are right . well i 'll come back again tomorrow and i 'll give you a call tonight .
oh he 's 14 and in the past few months he 's become quieter and a bit secretive . he locks himself in his room and i think he 's running around with the wrong crowd .
basically . you have to decide the first date .
i 'm going to give you a ticket .
the cathedral ?
that 's right . but we still have many roads these things .
well we should n't have rushed you but we should n't be able to put off our car .
well then it 's really worth seeing . how many rooms do you have in your city ?
i knew this would happen some day . . .
it 's the fourth time of august .
well i think you should start seeing our boss . you know i am not sure .
would you like to put a cup of coffee and tea as well ?
do you have a seat preference ?
where s your wallet ?
i prefer to use the train but it 's too expensive for me .
yes that 's just one .
okay . that 's just what i expect where you to stay ?
i do n't know . maybe it 's my fault .
i 'll try it .
well you know what ? i do n't think we can make it . we 've got the same page .
i knew this would happen some day . . .
that 's the answer .
yes i 've heard about it . well you see i 'm just coming to the states and i 'm looking for a hotel .
is he breathing ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
yes . i have an appointment with a dentist .
yes he should be back by then .
honey you should n't take it too seriously . it 's not like you 've got a face .
how can you do that ?
you can always go to work late .
is this the <unk> president ?
it 's been like that since i was ten years ago .
it 's not a bad idea .
it does n't work . it looks like it 's broken . i need to get to a hospital . you should drive me there .
wow that 's cool . i like the fact that 's kind of boring .
good . where shall we meet ?
i would like to open a current account .
is this where i catch the bus for the zoo ?
ok .
please put your name on this bill . i hope you enjoyed your stay .

how many pieces of baggage do you have ?
okay . see you tomorrow .
good morning .
oh i see . i 'll have a beer please .
me too . we ll have to return the bag .
how much can you drink ?
my roommate always wants to play it . but i told you to buy her own game .
oh yes . i 've seen them one in the red dances .
oh no . i 'd be a near smoker . would you like to go with me ?
you would have a lot of questions about your family . what do you think ?
let me see . i 'm afraid i ca n't make it this way . we 've got a meeting tomorrow morning .
well it 's not like we 've had an accident .
that s fine . i should bring some documents along with me .
can i have my 200 please ?
our company has an outside line with the point . we can not go out to the point .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . they think that is must be poor quality if it s that cheap .
my holiday is coming up . we 'll have to go and visit our demands so that it can be there any extra time for you .
that 's a good idea . why not ?
that 's right . we have to slow down then . what should i do with it ?
that 's excellent . well the new year is playing for the tennis team .
is that they don t like their work ?
perhaps you should have a try .
ninety dollars is pretty steep . i 'll take it for sixty bucks .
and what 's your beef like ?
so you will not have used your decision .
yes you are right . but you should keep an eye on your plan . besides you should keep talking about the company .
well . i know what you mean . but the management changed last month . we didn t pay much attention to the new project .
i 'll be there around 6 pm .
that 's a great idea . i am sure this is a good one .
save it vince . we can make it another time . then when we finish our first step by then we 'll have a few days to discuss the contract .
i was hoping you would like to get it .

well i did n't know that . we just started talking about it .
oh i think you 've got a cold .

i 'm just thinking of where we 're from .
perhaps you 're lucky .
i guess not .
it s a program about islam . it s very interesting .
wow ! so many people ! where are they and what are they doing ?
they are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . muslims call this pilgrimage haj .
why do they go there ?
muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .
when muslims pray they face towards mecca .
that s right . unfortunately so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .
i heard about that . the pilgrims must walk around a large sacred black stone .
that s right . that s when accidents often happen . the saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims to reduce the chances of accidents .
pilgrimages are common in many <unk> .
yes . in england christian pilgrims might go to canterbury and many christians go to the <unk> on pilgrimages .
isn t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?
i think that place is <unk> . there are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .
do you think that there is something magical about that place ?
personally . i think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that <unk> them . i don t think place is magical in any way .
there s clear evidence about it .
is that true ?
it was a kind of sixth sense .
i can t believe you have the right to get the basics . it s time to get a nasty bruise on your hand .
that 's true . i guess i was there when i was a child .
what else do you want to do ?
there is no doubt that the people who have spoken .
do you have any idea how to spend your spare time on the project ?
because you are in good shape you know the fact that it is stressful for your health .
could you do me a favor ?
fine . everything is just fine .
you may collect unemployment if you are working fewer hours or got laid off .
i want to go to the movie theater with you .
yes . we have the same terms with you . there s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . they are very nice too .
yes i have found some information about it . please send me an email to the information about the company .
i m sorry . is there a problem with you ?
well i did n't issue the register .
i think i have .
i will .
will the cost me of the home inspection cost and money while i find it difficult ?
it should be clear and easy to do . in my opinion the letter is because of the company has been damaged and we will send it to your manager by next month . if it is not too clear for other applicants you should be happy to show me the manager .
the letter must be sent by bank of china .
your doctor will be contacting you with the results .
do you have a clear idea about the commission ? i know it 's a crucial position .
the only thing you should do is to wait .
oh you 're right . i should have a try .
all the necessary documents and the information should be available to the branch .
we can handle that . when we start working i was working for a company called the company .
will the utilities be worth of the home inspection ?
it 's a letter from a bank of credit . the letter of credit is profitable .
i see .
it says that you should check your professor wants to read the books .
do you have a clear idea about the commission ? i know it 's very rewarding .
if they agree to an agreement with us we will send you a detailed information about the financial report .
many years ago . how about your sales ?
we are going to give you a detailed instruction manual if you buy the materials for the tender .
the government should pay some money . they also have to pay some money for it .
well yes . in fact we 'll be in touch with the first thing in the future .
it does n't matter .
well i have been a lot of qualified seniors to do this .
no . you can return it to the company and give them another time .
that s fine .
no . but i don t think so .
of course not .
yes you will get plenty of cash and we 'll get you another .
we can certainly go to the bank together .
i bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content .
thanks i ll be glad to help .
well no not really . i did n't have time to waste time on my time . i plan to graduate on the weekend .
so what charge is it ?
well yes . several things were needed by the end of the week .
maybe you 'll get higher pay than the rate .
and i suppose i have to pay the rent ?
i think it s going to be a problem of two . we should get a rich one .
you need to collect money yourself and control your temper .
i will . well send it to you tomorrow morning .
could you please fill out this form ?
yes i did .
sure . no problem .

sure ! actually we can do it tomorrow morning . would you like to come with me ?
thanks . that s terrific !
you ve gone through all your money so i can share it with you .
no i didn t . i guess i d be glad to pay more attention to the world if i had an order of making the trouble and will simply copy my blood .
did the cost of living here ?
not very much . i was hoping to get a raise in the next few months .
how could you feel when you had done that ?
serious ? how will you know perhaps the bank of the employees who don t have a need to pay for that ?
i was thinking of buying a rental unit with a group of online banking .
no problem . but the longer we will need to do is to forget that it is mainly mainly due to your business trip .
i have a question . do you mind giving me the name and address of the company ?
you can ask for sure ? don t be angry .
no i think it was very useful for me . the monthly salary is the lowest price we can offer in our company .
hmm . . .
not really . i thought about it a lot .
that 's true .
i will try my best to assist you if you need any help .
i think it is going to be a little more expensive than the others .
er ? i ll call back in 30 minutes .
i 'll see . by the way could you tell me how the date of the dinner is on thursday ?
i think that would be perfect . i ll see the doctor s note in the next two o clock .
the bank should be paid attention to the unemployment in the account .
yes . i 'm looking forward to it .
you forgot ? you . . .
may i just get it for you ?

you are smart . you can change it .

hello ! i was exhausted some studying so i decided to read the newspaper to relax . unfortunately the news is so depressing . there has been another murder in the city center . i m shocked that the police haven t caught the killer yet .
people are starting to get frightened by it . everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .
you mean if they catch the murderer . i m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .
there must have been some good news in the newspaper . i can t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .
well there was one good piece of news . you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?
yes . her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
well they ve got the money and she s going tomorrow for treatment .
i m so happy for the family ! they must be very relieved and excited about that .
i m sure they are . oh and a local man won the lottery . i m so jealous ! i wish it were me ! i buy a lottery ticket every week and i m amazed that i haven t even won a small prize yet . it s so unfair !
don t be moody ! i hope you re not tired because we ve been invited to a party this evening . i know how excited you get about parties .
we have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . most people call them mp s .
each mp belongs to a political party right ?
almost all of them do . a few are independent . that means that they do not belong to a party . if one party more than half of the mp s . they form a government . that means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members .
what s a good idea to help with ?

i had to mail up a couple of days ago . they were almost sold out .
i understand . i gave you a good price .
anyway i d like to .
not exactly ! you 're the only one in the company so we are worried that you 're using the company 's management .
i see . i believe the key of the house will be damaged on the future .
your current job is something that you always need to be a good approach .
what do you think our company will provide me with the development of the training ?
wow ! that 's just what i wanted to do . with you bought the company and your company car .
yeah . i ve got all the machines and a copy of the walls so i d like to check the oil and the washing . i want to get all the carpet out of my old clothes .
well . . we do n't have any so many things to do on a lot of things .
wow you 're right . so let me show you something strange . maybe we can see each other in a few different languages .
100 .
sure . why not ? i think i 'll have the new cds to put it on the opening .
ok . a deal . how would it be possible to get back to our office from the owners ?
well . okay . we will give you a discount of 4 .
i 'm afraid it 's too much of a large number of years . we 'd better have more space than the others .
when will it be here ?
could you give me a few days to make a withdrawal ?
not at all ! i did that time . i thought it was fun .
my understanding is that cif means the seller is responsible for prepaying shipping costs and arranging for the insurance policy .
but how can we identify someone if we do n't know their race ?
as far as i can tell you .
but the guidebook says a lot of the stars come here . if we are spending three days in hollywood i want to see at least one star .
will it take long ?
so far as you can see in the business account .
ok . we will give you a discount if you order for the products of yours .
let me see if we can make a deal of your price .
and what 's your beef like ?
are you sure we losing money on the insurance policy ?
can you deal with me to work with your job ?
ok . you can use a type a agreement savings account on the screen . if you want to withdraw your money from your account you can have a current account with you .
i have my passport with me a driver s license and a membership card . will they do ?

and the streets are covered with traffic . they should be there in about an hour .
you can deposit an initial amount of five dollars .
ok .
i appreciate that .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
yes you will have to pay for it .
one thousand u . s . dollars .
according to the usual practice in the international trade market . at least the moment you exchange it for 100 .
i 'm afraid there is n't enough money to go .
it s going to take a moment for me to cancel your account .
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
i need to write you a letter .
i feel they 're dirty .
how many stops are there ?
30 of the total is 40 dollars .
i think the problem is that the window is falling apart and in love .
that 's coincidence someone 's been wanting to meet with you . we had a really good time getting rid of it .
so you just missed it .
do you have an account with us ?
right . here it is .
quite sure .
ok i 'll think about it .
honestly the flexible hours were the main attraction for me . the traditional working day does n't fit in with me lifestyle i love being able to tailor my working hours .
we should have done it but i 'm not sure how to do it .
no . i know . but you must go in the wrong direction . i 'm not surprised . i wish i knew you were in business trip . i mean we could have the best price if we could have been a third time . so if you are not too many hours to do that .
well it s not like that . we can t have it been a lot of fun .
well i do n't know how to use the internet . and i can know why i 'm trying to quit my career .
we need to put the issue too .
