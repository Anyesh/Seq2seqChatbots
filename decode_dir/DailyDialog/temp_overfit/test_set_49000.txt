you know i ca n't believe how hard it is to get used to a physical exercise .

it 's on the same street as this model .
here 's my ticket and my license .
it close by the end of the month .

i 'm very sorry about this .

you said you were only going to window shop !
she only takes a few hours .
do n't be so pathetic . it happens .
yeah . she is a good idea to tell her that the truth is rich .
it sounds like a good idea to get the stand . i ca n't stand it .
no way . i did n't mean to stop that one .
cool down harry ! what are you really mad about ? did you get ripped off ?
yes . last sunday i went to a nearby market . it was on <unk> fair . i chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot without even trying to strike a bargain . i paid one hundred and twenty . and just
is that so ? i 'm afraid the seller has been fully committed to sell it . bargaining is not an indispensable procedure in business deals . it 's the norm of free trade . the seller sets
but do n't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?
of course that 's something really irritation . and the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . i recommend you to consult the price tags in the superb
oh that 's great . we are sorry for that .
thanks for your advice . i hope i can stay up early enough .
we are very good because we have long roots and official in the environment .
and we are very busy working we eat too much fast food and that food is very fattening .
yes i do n't mind being healthy .
i go to bed at ten and get up at six .
that 's helpful for your health .
i know . maybe that 's what i need to do .
yes i do . i have n't finished them yet .
oh ? does mary know that ?
what about his hair ?

that s all right . i ll get her something .
80 yuan please .
here you are . i 'm sure all right .
yes we do . i think we 'll have this rose in size 8 .
would you mind if i helped out in the kitchen instead ? i do enjoy cooking .
this is supposed to be your vacation we 'd like you to just relax .
cooking makes me feel relaxed . so what are we cooking ?
ok well we 're going to make a pan of lasagne a salad and some garlic bread . here 's the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?
sure . we should probably preheat the oven right away too .
that 's a good idea . can you set the oven to 200 degrees celsius ?
that 's a bit high for lasagne . i 'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there .
fine . i 'll just get out the casserole dish the <unk> the salad bowl and the baking sheet .
you know i could do this myself . why do n't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ?
i do n't think it 's broken .
well if it 's not broken then you need to learn how to vacuum better because it does n't look like you 've vacuumed for ages !
fine . i 'll go vacuum . let me know if you need any other help .
yes of course . have you got the wrong road ?
will you let me know where to get off ?
we are going to have to go down this city and you 'll see a movie there .
come on . i 'll talk to you later .
that 'll be helpful . but you 'd better take a taxi .
i 'm totally prepared to leave until the wound is down .
it 's a fortyfive minute to an hour ride .
could you also take me some more ?
you are welcome . if you need any help just call .
of course . is the dinner still on ?
yes i was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .
we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .
that 's what i thought you would do . listen i live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . it 's just down the street from all the bars . you probably do n't want to be walking around after dark . it 's just down the street from t you ?
it ca n't be that bad .
but it is ! take this morning for example . the subway was so packed this morning i got totally squished by about a hundred busy <unk> on the way to work .
really ? i never would have guessed . the criminals must only come out in the evenings because i 've never noticed anything strange when i 've been at your house in the daytime .
do me a favor and take a taxi . it 'd make me feel a lot better .
ok we will . how do you get around in the evenings ?
when i first moved in i walked everywhere . but within a week i had my purse stolen just a block away from the police station ! now i always take public transportation .
has anything else happened to you ?
nothing else has happened to me but i have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close .
well we 'll be careful . thanks for letting me know .
yeah i know a lot about it . what 's your happened ?
are there many accidents in the city every day ?
you know the pollution problem is that the air pollution is exceptionally good .
how did the cops say ?
wow ! what 's the forty ?
hurry up the street is about to get there .
did n't mention it . if you have any good suggestions ?
i 'm going to get a costume game for julia .
tomorrow i am sorry to hear that .
i was born in the espresso .
that s horrible . what was the pls ?
he took all the medicine .
that 's great . did you think we can make the name of the <unk> ?
i 'm sure the pollution is cut into a tram .
you 're probably right . what do you need ?
it 's not for fun because you just drive like this one .
no sir . can i help you ?
no madam . where to ?
all right . do you want to go ?
thank you . i 'd like to have a cup of tea .
i am sorry sir .
that 's great . do you have any journey ?
no problem . do n't worry the taxi is faster than the bus .
good . let 's go !
you know i hate shopping more than anything else in this world .
i know . but we could get some exercise in and we could get some errands run too . windowshopping won t cost you anything .
what kind of errands do we need to run ?
well we could go to the newsagent s to pick up the sunday paper go to the butcher s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner and to the chemist s to pick up your prescription from the doctor .
i 'll only go if we can stop at the <unk> to pick up something to drink for tonight .
no problem . i 'll do that .
sounds good . you have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . i know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms especially if the stores have special offers .

hi wang . you re booked .
this is mr . white speaking .
can you spell it please ?
yes . that 's right .
ok . wait so long . it s the total number .
because i m not in the mood that s why .
well don t just sit there do something . come and help me in the kitchen .
help you in the kitchen i don t feel like it .
would you like to clear the table then ?
really ? do i have to do it ?
not if you don t want to .
really it 's so beautiful .
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
you must n't pick it in this place .
where it is ?
it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
hello is there anything i can help you with ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
i 'd better not smoke here .
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
i 'm sorry . i really ca n't see it .
it says no smoking .
sorry i 'm very near sighted .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do it again .
try to be more careful in future .
well it s not that serious . i always think we have to do it .
it says wet paint .
i am not surprised you eat too much .
and i suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office does n't help .
no i would n't think so .
i do wish i could lose weight .
well why do n't you go on the diet ?
i 've tried diets before but they 've never worked .
perhaps you should exercise more . why do n't you go to an exercise class ?
yes maybe i should .
that is just an excuse . you can always find some time to exercise .
but i work hard all the time for long hours . often i have no time for lunch . yet i am still getting fatter .
bill you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . and skipping meals will not help you lose weight . in fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals .
i know you 're right but what can i do ?
how about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ?
but i 'll miss the news . it 's important in my business to keep up with events in china .
i know i know . have you got a portable radio ? you can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time .
which is that ?
i like chocolate .
thank you . can i get my book here ?
i want the kind of snack and chicken .
pork chops .
the <unk> are excellent .
ok . i ll have them brought to your room right away .
no you do n't want to go to bed for that . it 's already heavy .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
well i swim and run every day .
now tell me what do you eat ?
well i do n't eat any meat but i do eat fish and eggs .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
oh yes and fruit i love fruit .
what do you drink ?
well i never drink alcohol coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
what do you drink ?
you too . have you lost some weight ?
yes i took off 4 kilos . i am glad you notice it .
not some crazy diet fat i hope .
no no no i just changed my eating habits . i eat a balance meal . and i eat less than before .
what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
ah yes .
ah yes that 's right .
ah yes that 's david .
oh great . thank you .
i would like to talk to you about your chinese food .
no thanks . i have had enough .
actually you have n't had much .
to tell you the truth i am on the diet .
that sounds ridiculous . why ?
well i am gaining weight these days and i have to watch my calories .
no do n't try to tempt me . i 'm becoming chubby and i have to slender down .
you are not really chubby . you are actually thin enough .
i do n't think so . i know i 've put on weight this winter .
so you are watching your weight are n't you ?
yes to tell you the truth . i am on the diet .
where are you heading now ?
i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road . it is very close to your house .
is that the university next to the teachers college ?
no . it is . but for me today .
his house must be worth millions ! that is one of the most beautiful areas in oxford . the surrounding area is really peaceful and getting into the city centre from there is very convenient . how can he afford that place ?
yeah . if we share the cab it 'll be cheaper . besides that your chinese is better than mine . the drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though i practice my pronunciation carefully .
well . do n't worry about it i will be happy to share the taxi with you .
not very far from here . we 'll fly . it 's about one and a half hours .
here we are .
i have to go back to the traffic jam .
ok sir . a single room with a bath from the fifth floor .
there 's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
that 's great . i 'll see you tomorrow then .
here 's twenty dollars .
we have enough time . can you show me your baggage ?
no . if you ca n't break it keep the change . but can you give me a receipt ?
here is your receipt . thank you .
yes they all stop at this corner .
i want to go to broadway and 82nd street . can i take any bus that comes along ?
you can take any bus except the number 9 .
how often do the buses run ?
they run about every five minutes .
fine . how long does it take to get to 82nd street ?
about fifteen minutes . it 's not far . are you a stranger in new york ?
no i am . i arrived only three days ago from japan .
how do you like new york city ?
i like it very much but it 's a little confusing to me .
you 'll soon get accustomed to it . it 's not difficult . well here 's the bus . fortunately it 's not full .
thank you for the information .
you 're welcome . and your total is 5 . 48 .
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
i saw her yesterday . she was a little better .
must i catch a number 7 bus to get there ?
no you need n't . a number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital .
number 13 buses run much more frequently do n't they ?
yes . i caught a number 7 bus yesterday and they said i had taken a wrong bus .
thank you henry . i 'll get a number 13 .
but number 13 buses leave from the center of town . you 'll have to walk two miles to catch one .
oh no . you should take the no . 14 tram .
where can i take it ?
two blocks down the street .
yes sir . how may i be of service ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
certainly . go along queen's road . . .
along queen's road . . .
yes and turn right at the hilton hotel .
right at the hilton .
then go up garden road past the cathedral .
the cathedral ?
yes . then cross the road at the next traffic lights . the peak tram is straight ahead . you ca n't miss it .
that 's very kind of you . thank you . er . . . have you got a pencil ?
not at all . it 's my pleasure .
can you repeat all that ? i think i 'd better write it down .
there s one at the corner of <unk> street .

i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
er . . . it simulates the real supermarket which makes it feel so real . mom will love it . she loves shopping in supermarkets .
next time you can get one from the counter over there . or before you come in you can download one from our website . it 's really easy .
yes madam . turn right at the traffic lights .
i think so . remember the policeman told me that you are interested in the <unk> and our children s hard to get changed .
i can understand what you mean .
thanks . i will wait for that moment .
well that looks like something on your left .

a bookstore probably . with a yellow and orange logo .
i wish our family took us so long .

so what s the matter with that ? maybe i d just like the game .

it 's a good number but i 'm afraid we have to pay the bills soon .
well in that case you should ask your name .
i have a parttime job as a bartender .
since it 's not so convenient that you think it must be returned by your car .
oh is the train station close on the meter ?
no . it would be difficult to find a second place in the city .
will you please tell me if there is any mistake in it ?
good afternoon . mr . sun .
ok sir . would you like your shave ?
i 'm not sure . what do you suggest ?
it 's a long time since you had a haircut last time is n't it ?

i 'd like to try it on .
well your size is very dry . how about this one ? it 's bigger and style .
what hairstyle do you feel will look best on me ?
i 'm sorry to say that . what do you think ?
no . i have to be back in a minute .
oh that 's great . i will take a doctor to help me with my hair .
i 'll take it too . now if you want me to fill up the tank ?
well cabs are more expensive than the bus or the subway . it ll probably cost around six dollars .
i see . well can i have a look at your phone ? unfortunately this phone can t be used in the us it s not compatible with our 3g network .
what ? really ? i don t really want to have to buy a new phone .
well you re in luck ! you see if you sign up for our threeyear plan we ll throw in a handset for free .
really ? what s the catch ?
there s no catch ! you just choose a plan sign a threeyear contract and that s it ! actually we re running a special promotion right now and we re giving away a blackberry curve with our special mega value forty dollar plan .
so what does this plan include ?
well you get nine hundred anytime minutes and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other <unk> clients one thousand text messages per month and unlimited evening and weekend minutes . oh and we also offer a rollover option .
wow all this for forty dollars per month ?
that s right plus the activation fee the emergency services fee the monthly service fee the monthly service fee oh and any charges for extra minutes and . . .
sure . it 's 510 pm .
yes sir . but she 's not in .
i thought i did early morning .
my dear . that s my address .
it 's so true . what am i do ?
what 's up ? honey !
i see . but it is so hard to tell you the truth . i do n't think i can get you another one .
oh my god ! i forgot to call the police if you want to look at the station .
yes ! thank you for calling . see you tomorrow .
what sort of <unk> are we dealing with ?
we just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything . we have termites in the wood cockroaches all over the place and last night i saw a huge rat out in the backyard !
well there s nothing we can t handle . i ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches but the termites will be harder to get rid of . we will have to cover the entire house and <unk> it . unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days .
no problem just get rid of the bugs !
morning michael . i ve been very busy lately . one of our other vendors is going out of business and i ve been searching for a suitable replacement .
well rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run please sit down . coffee ?
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i did n't want to be late . but i was the first one there .
haha i could never do that . i d be a zombie if i didn t have my morning coffee fix . let s get down to business then .
yes . i ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . the demand for phone cameras is growing and pear has been falling behind in the market .
that s great ! i m glad to hear that pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . is pear still interested in having those ?
no we re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . we were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
surely . let s get started by drafting a new contract .
sure what kind of shoe are you looking for ? we ve got <unk> sandals sleek high heels edgy pumps or if you re looking for something a little more practical we ve got mary janes ballerinas .
show me some classic high heels please .
ok right this way . what color did you have in mind ?
black . classic .
of course . we ve got this style here that is very popular . because it s an opentoe shoe you can wear it any time of the year . they look great on everyone .
umm . too shiny . and i wear pantyhose with my shoes so let s look for a <unk> shoe .
ok these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a twoinch heel so they are very comfortable .
i don t like the pointed toes . let me take a look at what else you have . too high . that one looks like the back would cut into my heel . i have a high instep so i doubt that one will fit properly . i don t want bows . i find <unk> very uncomfortable . those might as well be stilettos . too modern . ah finally this is what i m looking for .
ok here s a good idea . i m going to like this one .
medium please .
what is your date of birth ?
hmmm . not good . they re too tight . the length is right but the shoe is too narrow and it s pinching my toes . and there d be no room for my <unk> . you know what ? i don t think i have the patience for this today . they used to . they just don t make shoes like they used to . i ll
have a nice day ma am .
why not ? come on ! just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
i will ! i ll feed it bathe it and walk it every day ! we can get a <unk> !
what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus our apartment is too small for that <unk> of dog .
ok . how about we get a cat or a <unk> ?
we re planning on having children soon i don t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
fine ! let s get a bird then ! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! a parrot would be awesome !
i ll tell you what i can get you some hamsters and we ll take it from there .
<unk> !
well since we are getting up so late i decided to make a big breakfast !
nice ! brunch !
kind of so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
wow ! you really went all out ! did you make any coffee ?
yeah just the way you like it ! i also put out some cereal and <unk> if you feel like having something more light .
looks good ! i ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
get the jam and butter while you are in there ! oh ! and don t forget the syrup !
what ? you don t know the first thing about gardening !
on the contrary i have been reading a lot of books about the subject .
oh yeah ? tell me then smarty pants how will you go about setting up your garden ?
well first i need to buy some things such as fertilizer seeds and tools .
what type of tools ?
you know the basics . a rake shovel spade and a hoe .
right . well it seems like you have all your bases covered . what s next ?
i ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . i ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! gardening all done !
well good luck with your garden especially considering we are in the dry season and it won t rain for the next three months !
no thank you i am not interested .
please ma am if you could spare five minutes of your time i am sure we could find something that interests you !
i wish i could but i have to walk the dog and finish cooking so if you would excuse me .
we have a great variety of magazines all about cooking ! this one for example is a bi monthly publication with recipes from all over the world !
wow that would be kind of useful do you have any other cooking magazines ?
sure do ! this one is a quarterly publication but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas !
wow this is nice ! ok sign me up for both publications .
you mentioned you have a dog most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care pet shops and even pet sitters !
that is exactly what i needed ! what else do you have ?
well i also have . . .

well all right . we have to have the party at noon office .
you have to do your own husband .
i m sorry mr . baker . i 'll be back at five o 'clock .
let me see . where 's meet ?
no thanks . you can meet the needs at noon .
but it s not going to be fun .
i should also have some new cards with me .
you really should . but do n't forget to put anything under the seat .
i think the classes really enjoy the deposit .
what is the rent for ?
you can t have apartment on the rent or a cashier s check .
yes it 's convenient .
well he had a bad dream .
what are the meals ?
when can you move in ?
i am very sorry i have n't .
well i still have to call them now . if you can wait any minute .
really ? did you call the apartment management ?
do you want some more one ?
well it s almost cheap and i really like the apartment .
you are not english are you ?
i was in the same system when i called home myself .
i need to go to the airport to pick up a new one .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
i 'll keep that in mind . thanks .
i 'll keep that in mind . thanks .
where s your polling place ?
we 're going to need to check out the refrigerator .
i am going to have to call you back .
is this your first time to me ?
i 'm pretty good you ?
i had a problem with this offer .
i have a question .
no it is n't .
that would be wonderful . i think the forward is a wonderful time to move in .
the view is quite high .
i would like to do that right now if you could .
when you come in and fill out the paperwork .
that 's right .
see you then .
ok we 'll be expecting you at 1130 . see you then .
it 's really convenient .
i know it 's really nice talking to you .
i just feel funny .
you know what ?
someone else is making charges on my debit card .
i ll keep that in mind . i ll just make sure that you re all right .
if you move in before me your apartment will be closed .
you should check the connections .
ok ! i 'll repair the television on my old man !
really ? when did you find the apartment ?
i m glad to hear that . thank you .
i m glad that you would come out of the house .
what are your plans now that you re getting out ?
the rent is 1500 per month .
that s way too much .
that s what i m going to do .
well not really . i think i 'd better get a discount .
in that case i 'll give you a 5 percent discount .
then i m sorry .
it s too bad that you can t afford to pay the price .
that 's too much for me .
great . what time would you like to meet ?
we have a lot of things to do right now . first i understand that i will understand what you 're talking about .
i had no idea . i had a house in the freezer but at home this weekend is very important .
can you call the owners with a acceptance right away ?
i know but they always get broken . i m not going to move around the track .
the owners may not be aware of everything .
i can t believe it .
the owners may not be aware of everything wrong with the house .
how much will the price be ?
i just found some fairly major problems .
unfortunately it would be the first time to pick up your name .
what time will you be dining with us ?
the place is 200 dollars a day . if you put a name on it please .
i really want to paint it took so much time and get away on the walls .
that 's a good idea . let 's do it in the future .
when are you in the convenient ?
i am sorry . that will not be a problem . how about it ?
do you think that it could be a good idea ?
my parents are free on tuesday .
yes . which one is the brake again ?
the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas .
i m glad this car is an automatic . i do n't like having to change gears .
automatics are very simple to drive . the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver s seat !
very funny . next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . can you see out of them ?
i can t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . could you move it forward a bit please ?
you re right . i do n't know the car of the tree .
i m working here today .
check your petrol situation .
the tank is almost empty . i guess i ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up .
that s a good idea . put your keys in the ignition start it up put the car in reserve wait for the road to be clear and then back out of the <unk> .
i got it . don t worry . i ll get you there in one piece .
remember no honking this time . the horn is only for emergencies !
why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ?
i 'm not quitting yet . you know my favourite slogan do n't you ?
yeah i know . shop till you drop .
right !
i 'm getting a little short on cash .
why do n't you go with me ?
i 'll pick you up .
ahahah and i thought you were tired .
you know . i have a a a weakness for long dresses .
it sure looks special looks expensive too .
sure does . hey can i sponge a little cash of you ?
do n't worry mary i 've got you covered .
thanks miss . you are very kind of you .
eyes you sent them to new york right ?
that 's right . i thought we did .
what do you think of the pamphlets with beautiful pictures ?
give me a short haircut .
we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . the same designs can be found on these posters .
posters are difficult to travel with . i think i 'll just buy the postcards . i heard that you might also have some of the <unk> that are made in venice .
yes they do . they 're on the wall behind you .
how much do they cost ?
not much at all . i think it 's about 100 dollars .
yes i think i 'd like the green mask in the middle .
would you like some more ?
i 'll take it i 'd also like to buy some chocolate .
are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift ?
it 's my girlfriend 's birthday today and she loves chocolate .
we 've got plenty to choose from here .
they look delicious . i think she 'll be pleased .
the food is excellent .
do you have a car ?
i do n't know what happened to me .
thank you . this is good at helping you !
wow ! is n't that dangerous ?
i 'm just so tired .
i can tell you what kind of sport you are on . or what do you do ?
after all i have a new heart i just took a a a a a a break and it took a while to me .
right . i see it now . the room is closing now . you have a lot of makeup in your room .
do n't you really enjoy such dangerous sports ?
very well this is very nice of you to do your work .
all these . i . . .
well first of all you have to do is to use your learner 's permit .
oh . i am not his fan .
not yet . what 's up ?
sure . i can t we go shopping . i 'm gonna have something on my own .
do you know where dawanglu is ?
sorry but he 's busy then too .
i know . but i 'd like to have lunch with you . what time do you want to come ?
look at the tree . it 's beautiful .
i like this one .
well i really like being with him .
i know . we can eat a horse now .
okay let 's go to the restaurant nearby .
i agree . the service was difficult at this time .
i think that i might be a little more careful .
what 's so great about it ?
what do you mean ? it 's a scrim .
not to me i would n't be caught dead in that .
i love that kind of stuff .
yeah you seem to like those styles .
sure do . i get a kick out of looking <unk> .
this one looks really expensive though .
i do n't care how much it costs . i 'm rolling in it .
lucky you ! i ca n't buy anything else . i 'm flat broke .
i got a replace my party outfit i trashed it last week .
why did you drag me into this ? i 've spent a week salary .
are you on the level ? you 're the one who called me remember ?
just joking t . i 've got some wonderful clothes . let 's go and have a close look at your outfit .
you can buy the bubble wrap here but you ll have to stand in line over here to post your package .
that s really a big one . i think it s really expensive .
it takes about 3 minutes per person so it ll probably be about an hour s wait .
can i buy stamps here ?
sure . how many would you like ?
i need 30 for my christmas cards .
are you sending them abroad ?
twenty of them are going abroad to china and america .
do you have any going anywhere in the eu ? if you do those are less expensive .
well i am afraid i do n't bring my passport with me today . can you save it for us until tomorrow ?
what about his hair ?
and the bubble wrap ?
that s another quid .
thanks a lot . you ve been very helpful .
i want to open another account .

ok here are some of our most popular perfumes .
which one would you recommend ?
del is the best choice .
that smells great . i 'll take one bottle please .
would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
it 's ok . she normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder and i do n't know what shade to buy .
how about some lipstick ? every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick .
she does n't usually wear lipstick . she thinks it makes her nose look too big .
how about some mascara ? that will make her eyes look bigger .
no thank you . she 's very kind of girl .
i know what she would likesome whitening cream .
no thanks . western women usually try to make their skin darker not lighter .
will that be all then ?
that will be all . you 've been very helpful thanks .
yeah i 'm glad that we did n't have to wait long . i 'm starving !
let 's take a look at the menu so we can order . do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?
what would you rather have samosas or poppadoms ?
i heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .
well let 's get a plate of those then .
sounds good . what are you going to have for your main course ?
i think i might have a dahl .
what 's in a dahl ?
it 's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .
that sounds nice . do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
ok . how about some lamb kebabs ?
that 's my favourite . do you want to have some wine or beer ?
i think i 'll have a beer .
ok shall i flag down the waitress ?
i would n't recommend it . i think we should wait until she comes round .
you 're right . that might seem a bit rude . it 's a good thing i 've got you with me !
what would you do without me ?
are you also going to the meeting that day after tomorrow ?
can you show me the latest ?
i think i love this wine ! it goes very well with the chicken !
well maybe one over there . can you also try to buy some color that is ?
do you have any particular size that you want ?
but as a matter of fact we 'll give you a discount .
yes . red is my friend 's birthday .

i think so too . sometimes he s very handsome and warm .
i like the brown one . i think it fits me well . let me try it on .
that 's very easy . i think i can do all the other documents .
the heel is a little tight .
ok . i will just have to get the shirt done .
i 'd like that . you may have a tub ice cream too .
i 'd like a sprite .
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
yeah right ! i m serious ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
do you want me to show you some pictures ?
i have no idea what kind of food do you like ?

my favorite is diablo . it used to be star craft but i really liked it .
do you have anything to make an decision ?
no i did n't . i worked in an act as a matter of fact .
i 'm going to make sure that my mother is a german one . so i will take it .
i do n't know . what can you do ?
is that right ? but you were only responsible for that company ?
he 's very handsome ! he has his attention only a few times .
that 's not true . we should talk about it .
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal on such as airline constantly evolving trade and they can make an appointment .
well if you do n't know the exams are pretty good .
it 's a fast story . i heard it was very difficult to get rid of him .

well i just lost my bill .
oh really ? i 'm going to take it easy . keeping up early and get back to you !
i 'm so glad to do that .
do you know the last time ? it 's been working three days .
good idea . let 's talk about it next time .
i do n't know . my boss just told me to come back .
let me know what you mean .
i do n't know . it 's got four points in teams and have a good singer .
i do n't know . i want to play volleyball .
you can ask me a little bit about it .
i took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station . it took me 20 minutes .
you did ? how about you ?
i would do that . thank you .
very well i 've tried them . is that a lot of paper ?
well there is nothing serious . most of them is the job you 've had is one .
ok just try .
it could be dangerous like that .
you re right .
that sounds like it would be going to be a great party .
nice to meet you lvan . my name is alike .
nice to meet you too . my name is lucky .
a second language is always difficult .
true but english is harder than most . it s a crazy language .
a crazy language ? why do you say that ?
one letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .
no wonder you say english is a crazy language .
it s true . i was a little nervous .
well let 's go now .
i got a driver 's license .
after a u . s . ?
to be honest i like most of them except for my chinese teacher . she is quite young but her class is too boring !
i think so too . i do n't like him either . i mean he s really cute .
he was pretty good .
i think it s too difficult to follow your school .
she 's in a public school .
you mean she is ?
i think she is right .
she is a pretty mother but she must be very angry with her .
yes she 's right .
ok . and after you buy two tickets ?
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
what is that ? what are you doing ? you re taking the right time ?
are you kidding me ?
you must feel really worried right now . but you know your dad is a fighter .
no but i could n't . she told me that she 'd be a very pleased .
you mean she did n't do that well .
yeah . i think the teacher had a very good voice for us .
yeah you are very lucky to believe the teacher .
she is a typical chinese teacher .
what are your strengths and weaknesses ?
i learned to be patient when i was in college .
i know . it was a little bit slow .
no . i ca n't believe it . it 's not a bit difficult .
i m not sure .
no but she was always stubbornly independent .
i see . in a sense it is difficult to avoid people who eat more money than a few things the things they earn . i guess you can see much better than a few things .
absolutely . she s very intelligent .
well then we must have a huge girl .
yes . it s a lot of fun though .
i saw her husband s eyes on the other day .
she 's a bachelor .
so what about her ?
yes i have . but i may read them by tomorrow .
yeah that 's what everyone says !
why do you think that one is better than the others ?
you ca n't help learning when you 're using it all day . you ll see . a few weeks study in the school will have a similar effect on you .
i hope so . you see at the moment i find it difficult to get used to the teacher 's speed and accent . i 'm awfully worried i ca n't reply as quickly as she seems to expect .
oh she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use english throughout the class . she does n't mind your making mistakes though .
you know speaking in class is a very good chance to put your english to practical use .
that 's the new teacher .
what do you think of the teacher ?
she 's very nice .
what does she teach ?
english of course .
is she your teacher ?
yes . she teaches our class three times a week .
can she speak chinese to her students ?
not very much .
it 's a good thing you can speak english !
yes i finished last friday .
you sound relieved .
well yes . i do n't mind admitting that i am . i enjoyed school but i did object to having to go in every day once we 've done all our exams .
well what are you going to do now ? have you made any plans ?
yes i intend to go to university . that ll be in september . but it all depends on my a level results .
you mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your a level subjects ?
yes as long as i do . in my country i practice for two years .
five days a week too ?
actually five and a half . on saturday we have classes only in the morning .
gosh !
that 's too much for us really .
then i know you must know what you mean . our company is a soft and development .
i 'm going to buy a new air conditioner for my parents . oh it s two o clock . i must go now .
when do you start school ?
i 'm going to register right now .
go make it to the final decision .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
a word no one has a fine eyes and a good taste .
i have no idea . let 's go into the <unk> field .
you re too used to do the same way .
in america most of the students in universities only go to university but after school .
why are the national economy ?
boston university . in university english schools they go to a public school or a private school .
how about a home of the university ?
some students go to school but in taiwan too much after school . they do n't have to pay a lot of attention to them .
it 's almost impossible to get home .
i don t have one . i prefer to buy shares . my also provides a share trading service and the only thing we have in my country . it s cheap and easy to use .
there are hundreds and hundreds . english is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions .
can you give us an example ?
i 'll look up the rate . to look up does n't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . it means to search for and find some information .
what about the expression goodbye ? is that an idiom ?
that is just a natural grammatical english expression . it has a direct translation in other languages .
this is interesting ms . parker .
i want to get a passport .
give them here .
oh yeah . here you go .
all right . now you can take your case away
i do n't have to pay you for any fees ?
yes . does it operate night and day ?
what if i can t meet that requirement ?
your fees total 235 . 13 .
i won t be able to pay that right now .
you can go today to take some money from the account today .
i ll just have to pay you back later .
i need to withdraw some money .
can i have your name please ?
what s going to be the problem ?
ok here you go .
i don t like that .
ok it 's a date then !
what s next ?
would you like cash back ?
okay . here you go .
i 'll take it i 'd also like to buy some chocolate .
oh . thanks .
i would like to look at some watch .
you will need to apply for one .
when can i do that ?
you can use this afternoon .
i d like to do that .
how much would you like ?
what do you need to do ?
every option you can choose will appear on the screen . that s about it .
when will my passport be ready ?
about 20 to 30 minutes .
oh there are n't many things i need to do but i have a lot of things to take my passport .
walk two blocks and then turn left .
i have both but i usually use my car to get to school .
but how much do you need to pay ?
i am not sure what a handicapped spot is .
the handicapped logo with blue means that you are not to park there unless you have a handicapped permit . will you mostly be parking during the day or the night ?
i do n't know how to park in the daytime .
be careful about the time limits on the streets . have you seen the signs for time limits ?
what signs ?
pay attention to what the signs tell you in the evenings .
i do n't know what the curb colors mean .
if you remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means that you can only load and unload you are going to be ok .

anything else i can do for you ?
i 'm sorry . you should have kept .

you 're right . i ca n't just hold a candle . i do n't think he 's doing anything .
he 'll see you at his time .
alright if you want me to have something nice maybe you might want .
what about some other time ?
really ? that s wonderful .
you 're not going to have to pay anything ?
yeah . i heard that the <unk> was very good .
it 's super .
yes . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
maybe nowadays people hold a talking to you .
well i 'm surprised to hear that . how old is it ?
yes it 's very important .
my better !
why ?
no i did n't . was it good ?
it 's really good .
i do n't think much of the film .
i think it is the worst one i have ever seen .
oh i 'm not sure i agree with you . it was not a good one but it was n't too bad . actually it was n't too bad .
i ca n't think the same .
what 's more some scenes were good much fit for the children .
i could n't agree with you .
yes sir . how may i be of service ?
would you like to go to skating ? i was going to the summer vacation .
it s really hard to say .
which subway should i take to get to the east side ?

i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
you did n't ? but my rear bumper is messed up .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
because it 's too exciting to be in the city and i want to not good working for a home .
you 'll be right .
what do you think about the olympic games ?
really ? what is that ?
yes . everyone in his office thinks he 's very common .
it is so beautiful . i really hope the scenery is n't too dangerous .
i 'm sick of it too .
the door bell does n't work the sink is leaking
it 's no use complaining . if we had got enough money we could n't put up with it and would have moved out .
you are such a good idea .
how could i feel easy ? i m really pissed .
but you should avoid <unk> when you haven t got the real facts .
ok . i ll try my best to calm down first .
oh i am very sorry hans . thank you for waiting for me . you must have been here a long time already .
it s all right .
i was caught in the heavy rain or i would have come earlier . i am sorry i kept you waiting .
i was in a comfortable place so really it s no problem . i am happy to see you . did the rain hold you up long ?
yes . when i came out of the subway it was raining cats and dogs . and i forgot my umbrella . so i had to wait for the rain to let up .
i totally understand .
she didn t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day s hard work .
poor girl !
not much except that my motherinlaw is driving me up the wall .
that 's really great ! it 's just the way to move around .
my mattress was supposed to be delivered today .
my sister used to do the same thing to him . if it was n't disciplining them enough . she also complained about her that the food we were disciplining them too and not to cook .
like for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
no i ca n't see that happening . i know you 're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
it 's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .
my motherinlaw used to do the same thing to us . if it was n't disciplining them enough then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them the schools we sent them too and everything else under the sun .
do n't be too modest . i know more about it . is it really a trend ?
i have to tell her .
i am sorry to hear that . she 's not a real turnon right ?
hi . steven . i just drop in and want to have a chat with you .
yeah it was . i ve just been there several times . it s too sad to get into the office .
hey i 'm just glad that you 're here . it 's a nice place .
ok you 're right . i ll have to look at it .
i realize that . how much do you think you lost me ?
we ve tried that many years ago .
ok . that s no problem .
not yet . i am really sorry .
no problem . i 'll try to be with you tomorrow night .
that s very kind of you .
zina ? why did you decide to end up with him ?
you gotta have some better deodorant .
yeah . if we have thirteen people from our home we will find something .
is there any way that he can be of good looking forward to jim ?
oh that 's what i thought . what if i am asking ?
thanks you for saying so .
i m sure you do miss that type of cooking . but can t you try to get used to western food ?
i have tried . but americans like butter bread sugar and cream too much .
i suppose you re right lee . maybe that s why so many westerners are overweight .
it s interesting that americans work very hard at their jobs do not take naps during the day and yet they can be so heavy .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too much fast food and that food is very fattening .
why don t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy being outside working during the day ?
what do you suggest ? i can t afford to quit my job until i get a new one .
maybe you have two choices . you could attend school during the day or you could get a position that provides training .
really it 's so beautiful .
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
you must n't pick it in this place .
where it is ?
it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
i 've never heard of that . there have n't been any problems but i really wanted to see the deal with it .
yes . i 'd like to borrow these books .
can you do anything else to declare ?
i 'm afraid you 've got a big issue .
it 's true . he always tickled my <unk> .
i bought it last week .
will the family be coming or with you ?
yes . this is the receipt .
thank you . what s your occupation mr . smith ?
what would you like to see ?
that 's what they are .
i know you 'll enjoy the movie .
yeah why do n't you do that ?
oh don t just tell me you re eating here ? i guess you ve got to have some good friends .
but that s great .
no i am afraid i have no time .
ha ! you 're just kidding .
really ? when will you be able to make it ?
i ran a couple of miles on the screen . i almost need you to take a look at it .
sounds fantastic ! i ll take you there . the stores will be booked up next week .
i do n't know . well my contract here is for one year and i do n't know what i should do after that . maybe going around for a while .
well have you ever thought about learning some chinese ?
actually i am learning that now . but it 's too hard for me . you know the four tones and the stuff . it really <unk> me out .
do n't worry . all things are difficult before they are easy .
you hit the nail right on the head .
well are you invested in some <unk> program ?
no . some of my friends are just about to watch some animals .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
awesome . i 've been giving this a lot of thought . when can we do this ?
how about this sunday ?
ok cool .
good . i 'll give you a call tonight .
okay . i 'll wait over there .
i might need some tools though . do you know where i can get some ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
you should have told me before . you will only be late because the connection is too bad .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
i am not in the mood .
why are you feeling depress ?
i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . it 's a real letdown .
i do n't think she would do such a thing .
but she did and it made me disappointed .
oh cheer up . a girlfriend is not everything .
but she means a lot to me .
then forgive her mistake .
oh . i just can t forget it .
do n't worry about it . i 'm not very good at it .
yes we do .
i ca n't catch the ninethirty train .
that 's right . you know they have easier said it when they 're not so happy .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
yes i like . but i ca n't play it well .
i know what movie is available then .
oh sorry . no a choice .
i 'll show you the door .
right now i am busy then .
mom you are right . it 's worth a taxi .
you really want me to invite you to enjoy the rest of my life .
you can do it .
i know . but i 'm in love at least .
which one do you mean ?
i do n't like pop music . so what is it ?
i thought the internet was that right .
but it 's too boring .
well there are n't much cheaper in it .
what 's that ?
yes . but can you tell me how to use it ?
what 's your parents opinion ?
how about your english ?
i hope you will become a big teacher .
we bought some fried chicken and chicken .
what about some green salad ?
no i wait a minute . where are you going ?
is this for business or pleasure ?
that 's fine . what i 'll have .
one moment please . how would you like this one ?
i am sorry too . i know we 've been talking about this beach trip for a while . i should have told bob i was busy this weekend .
do n't be silly . you guys should spend as much time together as you can . besides we can go to the beach anytime .
thanks for understanding .
well that 's what being friends is about is n't it ?
hey what if the three of us go to the beach together ? besides you and bob have n't seen each other for a while . i do n't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers .
nah i would n't worry about that . but i do n't want to be the third wheel . you two should have some quiet time to yourselves .
i know bob wo n't mind . you can bring a date like that guy from the bar you keep talking about .
maybe . . . i 'll think about it .
well last night i had a big argument with ann .
terrible . it must be something serious . you two are such close friends .
now that i look back at it it was n't that big a deal . i should n't have lost my temper .
if i were you i would think of something . it 's just a piece of cake .
he told me that his friend 's car broke down and they had to walk home .
that 's pretty harsh .
i know but i was so upset . i mean come on ! does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ?
you know she probably feels just as bad .
well i think i was being a little selfish myself . i know they do n't get to see each other very often .
well in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding . you should n't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . after all you can go to the beach anytime you want .
yeah i 'll call later to patch things up .
that 's very kind of you to say so . let 's try some <unk> wines .
great . sweet wines are my favorite . they always make a great finish to a decisions meal .
do you prefer brandy or ports .
port please .
excellent choice . i love its smooth flavor .
the port is quite exquisite . it must have spent years aging in barrels . am i right ?
yes . you always have a good nose for wines .
next time we are about to dinner we should try some canadian ice wine .
oh what 's that ?
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
why not ? it sounds great .
ok here 's to your health .
thanks . cheers .
cheers .
well yes . i heard everyone was going to be ready to the party .
i wanted to go to the beach there .
i 'm sorry . when did he last see ?
yes sir . we have your reservation . could you fill up these forms please ?
yes speaking . i just bought a training program last week .
he is a hard case to do that .
because he is often in trouble .
i guess he had a fantastic time .
yes and i agree with all his policies .
and he is so discuss with his friends from the u . s .
he 's really outgoing and honest .
he said that the guy was stolen by the police . that guy just ignore it .
oh no . he was n't a very sad .
how so happened ?
yes but what if he 's good to know ?
what s wrong ? that was a great goal .
yes but i bet 200 dollars on the cougars !
looks like you re going to lose out on this game then .
i can t believe it ! i thought the cougars were going to win for sure .
what were the odds ?
20 to 1 in favour of the cougars !
too bad .
what is it ? what happened ?
i think someone is stalking me .
no it ca n't be . really ? who ?
i do n't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking but staring . he just kept staring at me . he did n't stop .
you got it .
i helped build the sets and find props for the plays . what about you ?
did he leave when you left ?
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .
i 'm afraid not . he is in the driver .
that 's about five blocks . and around corners too . so he was definitely following you .
yes he was . i 'm not imagining it . finally just when i got home i turned around and looked at him . he was just standing there . he did n't smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious . what should i do ? i 'm so scared . can i call the police ?
actually i do n't think you can call the police . not yet at least . he has n't done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it . but if anything happens again then maybe you should call .
why ca n't i call the police now ? he was definitely following me !
of course you can call the police if you want . that 's not what i mean . i 'm just saying that they probably wo n't do anything .
i suppose . what can they do ? i do n't even know who he is .
listen carol . do n't let this bother you too much . probably it 's nothing . just keep your eyes open when you go out . if you see him a third time and if he follows you again then i think we should go to the police . but for now just try not to worry .
alright . and i wo n't go to that cafe for awhile .
more or the better . there 's just one thing bothering me .
oh ? what 's that ?
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
what ? let 's get some pictures ?
it 's an egyptian carpet . the student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . seeing what gift was i was really uncomfortable . i mean it 's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . i do n't think i 've done anything to
you refused the gift ? that 's terrible .
i know but i really ca n't accept such an expensive gift . i explained to him why but he seemed really upset about it . i think he might have taken it the wrong way .
perhaps . he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
that 's what i am worried about . i do understand the respect attached with the gift and i am honored . but i really do n't think it 's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . i think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .
yes . a lot of people have guns there .
can you tell me how to get to the jade buddha temple ?
i 'm not sure but it 's .
there must be some water on the wait . i ve got it .
i think the government has banned price .
do you know how to get an old one ?
they sell hard for a change .
do you want some more warm clothes or a small one ?
my husband said it was broken . the air conditioning and <unk> were empty .
do you know how to get the old one ?
air braking systems .
did you go to the student school ?
i was robbed .
the problem is that there is a reason in the case .
yes it 's pretty serious .
there is a problem . the problem is that i can see is happens all the time .
i 'm tired . i 'd like to make a change of time .
if you feel like i 'm scared we 'd better take a taxi .
ok . let 's drink a lot of lemon and lemon grass .
oh my god ! i had no plans so i do n't have to waste .
the street is n't wet .
you gotta have some better deodorant .
you 're right . that 's why i have to pay for some things .
as long as it is stressful it by taking a walk .
you should really go out with me tomorrow .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
yes it 's a lovely view .
you mean it 's not going to be really easy for me .
then i 'll leave the hotel in a comfortable place .
my birthday comes next month .
is the kitchen going to be dust ?
then i came back here . i worked for about three years to get some experience .
no you look so cool . i just want to see the sea !
yes . let 's go .
am i ready for what ?
i am leaving on august for august 15 .
well i could have a few friends that are free to do you go ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
i see . i 'll have a great time here .
yes i am going to have it on and i do n't mind .
no problem . when you leave the room a month will be ok .
how much do are you looking to spend ?
john .
can you tell me something about it ?
it 's fine . what are you more the lasts ?
thanks ma 'am . i 'll tell him .
hello steven .
i do n't think we have .
no . i have n't heard of it .
but you did n't do anything .
yeah . i know .
yes . does it operate night and day ?

have you thought about graduate school ?
no . i graduated from college as an english major .
what about his hair ?
you got me .
now listen ben . look i think it s a very good thing that a young man after he s done some very good work should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself and lie around and drink beer and so on . but after a few weeks i believe that person would want to take some stock in
no i 'm full .
i do n't know . i have n't done that before .
is there a big portion of that you are going to cook ?
we have n't been there for a long time .
pretty good . what about you ?

i must tell you the truth .
i did n't know .
i do n't know . i think it 's no use .
i have to work on saturday all day ! i really hate my job .
i love to see the classical music .
who 's winning ?
you have n't got any .
it 's so interesting . have you ever been on a bus ?
it 's a song that catches the songs and songs .
i agree . but i heard in the library it 's not really all the new teacher .
sure . it 's one of the biggest classical music events . have you ever been to the live show ?
yes i remember one last time .
you 're quite sure around the corner .
that 's for sure . you know i had the greatest time ever .
is n't there anything less expensive ?
oh speaking of the conductor he is indeed a genius . he did a perfect job . his name is menuhin a descendent of russian american immigrants .
well you 're a real television watcher .
i hope so .
i do n't know . but i think it 's so nice .
depends .
did you know ? i did n't know it was that they were in the us .
he lost his kids college money day trading .
i guess they were crazy .
sure . the first place is full of food and spicy food .
it is called the national park . it is a beautiful city with the air and the pictures of the park .
yes . the scenery there is so breathtaking
is there anything i can do for you ?
it 's our feel uncomfortable . it s always on my nerves .
that 's a great idea .
yes it is . a small blue sky and the smell of the hill is next to the top of the hill .
it seems that the weather is successful on the first day of year .
you can get way to the street . i am not sure you 'll find the way you can get there .
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
i 'm sorry . no . thank you all the same .
after a while crocodile .
this machine needs you to see that we have a few other kinds of things .

the shoes are over there .

that would be great . i m a new student here .
sure i can show you how to use the internet .
here you go . anything else ?
where is the computer ?
i m going to nanchang .
do you like a lot ?
because i do n't like it . it 's too complicated .
not really . the pop music starts at b . a . in front of the computers are n't enough to get tickets to the new hall .
all right . i 'll wait and take it right away .
yes you can understand . it is not far from our range . maybe you can help them .
yes it may be the advantage of it .
sure . since you have order the roast chicken .
shall we meet each other at the same time ?
sure . here is the website . just hit it .
is it convenient and convenient ?
i like collecting things .
i ca n't play that . you 're a good dancer .
you know what kind of teenagers do they want ? i do n't know much about them but a lot of fun .
do you get back to china ?
i guess i could !
and do you know how long it will take ?
maybe there 's something i 'll get worth watching .
it is such a nice place .
sure what would you like to discuss ?
yes sir . bye .
i think it 's better than her . well i do n't think we have any more beer though .
i 've been offered a scholarship for the first time .
i know . let 's find out what the problem is .
oh no . it 's already february 5th .
i used to play the games at least . i mean what i do .
and the other school gave us a special effort ?
not really . i would remember when it was a few minutes ago .
mmm how much is it ?
i know today is quite a range of heart almost an hour . so you do n't know what 's on your own .
oh yes i 'm glad that you 're so excited .
yeah the success stories of that english is really cool . each one has made millions of records worldwide audience .
oh poor me ! it is a good thing to tell you .
that 's great .
he did n't know . if he does n't stop that i 'll tell my mother .
what 's he like about your old one ?

thank you . i will help you with my colleagues .
so he is really proud .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
which subway should i take to get to the east side ?
what is the computer center ?
it bears a great many of advantages but also some weak points .
is it ? i 've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
for instance the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .
that 's true . some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
actually it 's not the fault of the mobile phone . but people should have a proper attitude towards it . mobile phone is a tool serving people not the fetters restricting them .
it 's not the weekend is n't it ?
i am not the work day . i have an assistant had a lot of homework and it was not so easy .
you 're really a <unk> . why are you ask for some time ?
that 's a good idea . i have to do it . my friend is going to take the university of the country .
well then it 's not my problem .
i know . i always feel better now .
no problem .
yeah . water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues .
but what are the sources of water pollution ?
they could generally be divided into two categories direct and indirect contaminant sources .
well i like to take out the money .
yeah . they are emitted directly into urban water supplies .
but what about the indirect ones ?
indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater .
i see . for the sake of us all we should be an active participator in the prevention of it .
sure . it 's an issue asking for everyone 's participation .
okay let 's call it a day .
where is it going to work ?
she will be pretty sure . our staff can help you with her .
nothing really . how about you ?
what kind of salary do you think are the better ?

well how can i put this ? france is a terrible team .
well what about the bill ?
you want to hear more about it . for example in good health is that possible ?
that is a good idea . but i am really getting on the internet . i have a lot of things .
i have a good time . but it is fun . i have tried it all day .
fine i 'll be expecting you .
let s meet in front of the train station .
when did you say ?
i really wanted to talk to you about that .
ok . bye !
yeah i know . but i still think it 's better than the old food .
that 's true . i guess a lot of people from different countries have different opinions .
well all right . that was red one of the road anyway . it was not that car .
because we 're not the same as on the bus anywhere .
i 'm sorry but i 've got to go .
oh gosh ! i have to go to the library with my son . they 're so busy !

our telephone number is <unk> in the nonsmoking room .

the view is breathtaking .
ok it is very nice to talk about this company . your company has always been very busy and i believe you will like it .
we have thought of you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience .
yeah . we just leave it at the same time and we are doing what we doing .
you are so sure . it 's really cold in the winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
we should do this more often .
seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? that 's a good idea . let 's go !

i said we 'll take a few days to get them .
i 've got it . i like the sound of stepping on the snow very much .
yes . you 're very kind .
do you smell the sweet scent ?
how big was it ?
no question . he was a <unk> player but he has the final sense of humor .
ok the first . . . here you are . it comes to 87 . <unk> .
sure . what are they ?
yeah yeah i was planning to get that fixed but my mom was away so we had to get started .
that sounds like the office . what did you say ?
i remember it . but it was on the first time .
well i hope it will be a finally !
thanks . i went to town on saturday .
that 's good for you . it 's one of the most rides .
you have a choice . the exercise is really a good exercise . i think it will be a good exercise .
could that be a very big open house ? i have to go to a car right now !
no that 's the only thing i did n't intend to go to china .
neither . the game ended in two all .
but i still think ac milan's defence seems better organized .
but the brazilian is tougher .
oh what 's he like normally ?
he is in his late thirties .
is it true ? the chinese alarm has been wearing .
you wear secondhand cloths ? they look so different .
this city is gorgeous with brand new technology . i like this color .
thank you . i think i should also have a view of the lake .
i 'm glad you like it . no one has been terribly beautiful .
very good idea . sometimes such pictures can show the house 's richness .
i see . well maybe we can climb a little too .
i think i d prefer to go but i prefer to have a little boy .
that 's true . i ca n't agree more .
sports .
what kind of stamps do you prefer ?
you are deadly right .
i like taking photos .
do you have any hobbies ?
yes but i find it very difficult to learn .
i think a play will be good .
that 's a good idea .
not much . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .
oh that 's exciting . what 's this guy like ? is he hot ?
well i did n't think so at first . but as we started talking i found his extremely funny and witty . i could n't stop laughing at his jokes ! we have so much in common . we like the same teams music and most amazingly we both love chinese food ! i have the feeling that we are going to be great friends .
it seems you two are a good match . what qualities do you look for in a friend ?
there 's nothing definite i think . i do n't have a list or anything but when i first meet somebody i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have a radar helping me spot new friends .
well that 's something i 've never heard of . but if you ask me what i value most in a friend i would have to say honesty .
i agree . you ca n't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .
yeah i know . a friend in need is a friend indeed . i do n't need fairweather friends either .
i like playing chess .
what kind of sport do you like ?
i like it very much .
how about the waltz ?
it is said that english is the most difficult language to learn . all the chinese chess are very simple .
is it difficult to follow those ?
you mean it is i do ?
i like to paint the plot .
the flower and the divided into the flower chair and the roast them .
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i am impressed with how smart and humorous .
oh it 's love at first sight . when will you see each other again ?
he did n't say but he said he would call me .
maybe he is busy with his work . just wait and try not to think about it too much !
oh steve . stop it ! i am a bit nervous ! what if he does n't call ?
i do n't think he needs you to call a few times . you 're a stranger here .
thank you steve . you 're always so encouraging .
that 's what friends are for .
thank you li mei . come into the dining room . i 'm going to cut the cake soon .
what do you want the happy birthday ?
that 's the man i want .
yes you are right .
let me tell you the story . in 1892 patty smith hill and mildred hill wrote a song called good morning to you . but later someone added the words happy birthday to their tune .
oh i guess it 's getting fat .
i m just worried tom . he must be really angry .
yes . but it 's not as bad as you can see .
i 'll give up a break .
what if you think about it ?
i taught english from a school .
you did n't ?
i do n't know . i just found the one that i was at a present and i have n't had any plans for me .
i 'm going to see a movie theater .
yeah it is pretty good but the place is so expensive and dangerous .
all right . i 'll be right back .
ok . i 'll have to wait .
oh really . i 'm looking forward to it .
i know one of my sisters is a doctor 's mother .
i love it ! what 's the good news ?
i think so too .
yeah i am going to see it .
next monday is my birthday and i would like you to attend my party .
i 'm quite sure you look grand when it 's done .
oh come on . i am going to have a try .
the house warming party is over there .
yeah . what does he want ?
ok no problem . i 'll go check it .
ok superman . put on your cape we 'll keep you up .
well what were you thinking about ?
because it 's not .
would you like to go skiing with me ?
that 's right .
that 's nice of you .
that 's just right . you really did a good show .
have you received the study before ?
what did you think of the movie ?
i 'm going to make sure and get my bag will you ?
hey let 's go out tomorrow night . the ram bar and grill is having a special on pitchers .
no . i said i was going to buy a new suit and to keep a bad record of the rent i just can t decide what to do .
he 's got a promotion .
did you look caught him in him ?
he told me that his friend 's car broke down and they had to walk home .
what happened ? did he say what happened ?
yeah he definitely does . what did you do ?
good . i was thinking that i d like to invite you to watch a movie . i can meet you at the cinema gate .
you can take a picture of the company that is not true .
that 's a bit too bad . have you handed down in my report to your mother ?
he 's a very good husband .
poor girl !
your company is <unk> by me .
i went back to the park . it was just before the first time .
your sister did ?
i read a story when he was a child .
it s all right though . just get off at the next stop and catch the 79a .
did you know the exact time ?
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
then he is really lucky .
i feel it 's worth it .
hey ! he 's a hard worker !
it s unbelievable .
i hope it works .
just a little . i 'm still tired of work .
do you really think this is ?
i am n't . i 've always loved each other .
he 's really a hard nut to do that .
yes . we have met him before .
that is true . i do n't think we 're going to have a meeting this morning .
we 're having a lot of fun .
that sounds like a good idea . you know how much i should pay .
well i have to tell you some more about your daughter . she s fine .
i can t believe it .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
really ? what was the big city ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
do n't worry about it . i 'm only too fast .
it s all right though . just get off at the next stop and catch the 79a .
he was definitely a very good student . he must be really influenced by the way . i mean it 's important for me to get used to it .
i hid so that it could n't see me . slowly it got closer and closer until . .
it s great to see you lose your weight .
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
what do you do with your work ?
i only knew this would be the best choice .
i 'm sorry . what 's your flight no . ?
how dreadful !
wow ! so many people started school in the city coming along ?
yeah . i 'm going to stay in bed .
my mother is a <unk> and my father is a bit upset .

so what 's the matter ?
it 's half past seven .
i 'll tell you what the problem is .
definitely .
we have a wonderful journey .
i 'm sorry . i do n't know how to use the key . can you tell me the name and the tv programs are coming back ?

yes i once saw the man who pulled the car .
well it 's a quarter to three things .
you re in america now my british friend . we just call it football .
oh right . so i can t quite follow what s going on . . . who s winning ?
the giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked but the <unk> have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone .
wow ! what a hit !
yeah he tackled him so hard his helmet came off .
is he ok ?
it looks like it he s getting up .
i guess he hit him too hard the <unk> just called a penalty on the home team .
the giants ?
yes i do . i know the feeling of the holiday .
why do n't you speak english ?
what happened ? why did everyone get so quiet ?
the <unk> s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . we re losing again .
yeah i just got them . i started playing ice hockey in a community league . so i finally got myself new skates .
what position do you play ?
i m a defender . it s a lot of fun . you don t have to be able to skate as fast on defense .
yeah you re a pretty big guy . i play goalie myself .
oh yeah ? which team ?
the rockets .
really ? i think we play you guys next week . well i have to go to practice . see you later .
all right see you later .
we are going to climb a cliff on the colorado river .
how hard is the climb ?
it is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .
what did you do last week ?
we rappelled down the side of a 300 foot cliff . it 's very exciting .
wow . that sounds like a lot of fun . i am sorry i missed it .
well you should come this weekend . i think you could do the climb .
yeah i will . see you then !
ok see you .
i 'm just watching some television .
i 'm so bored . i do n't know what i 'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning .
me too . do you think we are boring people ?
i do n't think we are boring . it 's just that we do n't have any hobbies .
that 's right . what do you think we should do as a hobby ?
that all depends on what you like to do . for example i like to doodle on the notepad so i 'm thinking about doing some real drawings .
i like to play the piano for fun .
yeah . that can be a good hobby .
hobbies are great . i 'm going to make a list of all the things i like to do .
that 's a great idea . i 'm going to do the same .
awesome we went to australia and new zealand .
that must have been wonderful . do anything interesting ?
well we went bungee jumping when we were in australia .
wow isn t that dangerous ?
a little but the rush was worth it .
well there 's no doubt in it .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
500 feet ! i would never be able to do that .
yeah it was scary but exhilarating .
i think there are many good shops around the world .

thank you for telling me that .
one more thing if you do n't mind .

i am so sorry about that .
well then he must be getting in touch .
because he likes to show himself at the university .
you 're telling me . he is always in love with you .
too bad man tonight is tracy s going away party and she asked if you were gonna go .
but i don t have the latest novel by looking for . i only have four weeks to save up the speed of every month .
yes . tea is very popular with me .
the bucky card is a great way for you to save money while you have to do it . you can also take part in the evening .
well i think tea is good for other people . it 's probably the same tea and it 's good for tea .
i 'll try the dish .
you know i often overhear our neighbor the young couple fighting about how to raise their kid and you will find a secret .

i am glad you say so . we have a great weekend .

well i came to know a girl three weeks ago and we have so much in common .
just asking ? but why is your face burning like mad ? ahhuh someone has a crush on jenny does n't he ?
no he did n't think of something . that 's why he has taken the heart .
come on ted ! do n't be such a chicken . if you like her you ve got to tell her . maybe she likes you .
i guess i am .
but that 's better than keeping everything to yourself . you 've got to let her know . come on ! you 've got to take a chance . even though you are rejected it 's not the end of the world . there 's nothing to lose is there ?
it 's so beautiful .
now i know what you 're saying . the last time i had been very tired .
i wish you good luck !
it 's certainly the nice holiday i guess .

yes of course . here you are .
what 's her favorite flower ?

i hate to tell you this .

ah yes . i love animals . i 'll go to the zoo .
do you have a good time on the field ?
how about the cinema ?
where are your parents ?
ok . that 's a good idea .
thank you . i had an idea of something with you yesterday evening in the hospital .
i bought it in the cafeteria .
not really . i just want a few different styles .
oh thank you . very much . mr . smith .
have you got the right color ?
i 'm not disciplined enough .
yes she 's right . but she said she was right now .
you have good taste . can you show me the <unk> ?
i think i will try it .
you should know that he is the only one he s really cute .
how do i know them ?
you really want to have it ?
what is the one ?
well it 's an <unk> . it was for sure .
that 's true . . . . well i think we can see how they taste your own .
give me a break . it 's fair .
you have a real talent ellen !
i am so sorry .
yes . i 'm really excited .
nothing much what 's going on ?
i ca n't go to the movies .
i am not . i just got hungry until the invitation .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that 's good . can you hear the nature of the world ?
i want to be there .
good idea . i think i will make a snack after work .
i 'll pick you up at your place at eight in the morning .
fine . see you then .
are you speaking of them ?
you are welcome . goodbye .
ok . bye .
thank you for saying so . you know it 's my pleasure to show me the truth .
thanks . it 's been a great pleasure to have you here .
i 'm a foreigner here . my english is n't perfect .
can you show me how to use it ?
bye .
sure . have you got anywhere in mind ?
i 'm starving so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .
that italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . do you want to go there ?
i 'm not really in the mood for italian actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy .
if you want spicy food then i 'd recommend going to a thai indian or chinese restaurant . how about that chinese buffet on <unk> road ?
i really like that restaurant you get a lot for your money there . but they 've westernized their food so it 's not actually that spicy .
you 're right . most of their dishes have sweet sauces . we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us .
the taj ? they 're a bit expensive but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
the taj it is then .
shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
they 'll still charge us a corkage fee .
that 's right . it 'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .
do n't worry about money . i 'll treat you tonight .
are you sure ? we could go dutch .
no i 'll pay . it 's my turn anyway . you paid last time .
i wo n't argue with that ! let 's go !
have fun .
could you tell me where i can find cap and gown ?
it 's really convenient . the subway station is pretty close to the subway .
here 's my card .
red cooked carp and <unk> with fresh mushrooms .
thanks mom . these are beautiful .
thank you . same to you .
yes i have been working here for a week . and you ?
i 've heard there is a very beautiful country . the ancient custom of holding temple fairs are different from the festival sales .
the same to you !
the same to you !
yes it was a great party .
i just got back from london .
did you have a car ?
i had a good time . you seem to be in a hurry . do n't let me hold you up .
i had a fantastic time . i got to be there !
come on . it 's probably time to clock up .
you can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains .
come on . you re right . he s better than keeping him well .
he is in his late thirties .
i missed it .
yes . it is .
congratulations !
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
he prefers suits to jackets .
judge from his look he 's a very serious person .
as a matter of fact he is .
do n't believe him . he 's a liar .
we cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
they have moved to chicago .
that sounds interesting . do you have any cheaper ones ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
why ? we just spend more money on it .
that 's just too much . i 'll go back to my office and draw them up .
each month it 's a great opportunity for students to get paid for their good salary .
ok . here 's the money .
that is very busy . i will leave around the office every day .
well in that case we will have to go to the restaurant in london .
no problem sir . i 'll tell you the next one .
i 'd like to go abroad .
what time does the party start ?
i was at work there .
it sounds like it 's very nice meeting you .
as a matter of fact i should n't keep the record of my life and even spend a lot of time on it .
in the buffet we use of different food .
how about meeting ?
where are we going to go ?
yes . so what about you ?
yes i have . it was one of the most famous . i was in china once it was film for a week .
it 's a romantic movie .
i do n't like it . what 's it like ?
good afternoon ! sit down please . how are you ?
i 'm very well thank you . how are you ?
very well too thank you very much . isn t it a lovely day ?
yes it 's beautiful but it 's also very hot .
you 're absolutely right .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
are you staying at the hilton ?
in london . where do you live ?
here . near this school .
i do n't want to see a bad movie .
i 've already got a very busy time . what have you been ?
i always enjoy working with you . and here are your new balance shoes .
nyu was my first choice but ucla is just fine .
i like spring .
how about summer ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i like spring too . we can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air .
i was robbed .
you have to pay a fine .
all right . i 'll have to turn it on .
i 'm sorry . we do n't have vacancies at all . what about you ?
c 'mon ! it 's a little bit crazy .
we 'd better go out for a walk .
you know . let 's go .
i like spring .
how about summer ?
i dislike it most .
i do n't think that we have a problem .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
but sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
i ll take a look forward to the matter .
i really hate this weather .
cool fellow what 's the date today buddy ?
it 's . . . oh it 's the 1st april april fool 's day .
you forgot all of about it did n't you ?
on 20th may 1963 .
do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ?
27th day of the fourth month .
by the way could you tell me when the film will begin ?
it will begin at 5 thirty .
that 's fine . i 'll be waiting for you .
i hope so . thank you .
i do n't want to miss it today .
as long as it is stressful it by taking a walk .
oh yes the music was too slow . was it really the scene with the judge great ?
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
yes it 's a lovely view .
yes . it was a small change of the table . i think it was as a person by the way .
then i 'll remember to leave in the city then .
i had that horrible head . they had my first night playing anyway .
you look so pale . i only have to watch the beach in the back .
yes . let 's go .
me too . recently i 've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them .
do you think that many people in the company ?
i 'm afraid not . to me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
that s right . i m just waiting for it . let s go .
i don t like the way to get them .
it is . the map is where the world is located .
when did you start worrying about your weight ?
crazy !
i will take this one .
are you from practicing football ?
how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look ? i remember there is one in the gym .
that 's a good idea . i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
me too . what did you have in mind ?
i have n't decided yet but i think the olympic mascots are a must .
i agree . they 're very lovely especially huan huan .
is there any more ?
the five dolls are sold together as a set and they 're priced according to the size . the bigger they are the more expensive .
oh i see . if i buy more than a set can i get any discount ?
i do n't think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now .
any other ideas ?
there are lots of things such as postcards key chains posters and various arts and crafts .
it all sounds great . we can go there after the match . i ca n't wait to see what they have .
i m very well . thank you .
ok let s enjoy the rest of the pcc first .
yes but there s a lot of <unk> in here .
yes that 's the point . i was in london and do n't mind being in a motel . it is too cold .
it 's not bad . there 's one at the end of the event .
which bus does n't i ?
it 's almost impossible to remember . the news is sydney then .
oh to tell you the truth i do n't like them . it 's a waste of time and money .
you mean like that ?
yes . that is a very long way we 'll keep the room in the car .
i bought you a new one last year . is n't it handsome ?
i like movies to keep a good movie . so i like movies .
no . i have n't .
ok . what do you like about it ?
yes . . . wow ! this one is very big !
ok . i shall tell you whether you like it .

how do you manage to meet your family ?
thank you mr . green .
i was hurt . i just can t stop sneezing . i think i m going to have to look at it .
do you think you ve got a cold ?
i have been in bed for a week . i ll let you know .
tell me about a time when you had a cold .
ok i know . but i must feel like going somewhere else .
joe ? i do n't know what you mean .
i remember you are in love .
oh i took a shine to him when we met for the first time . but it comes and goes .
it 's greek to me .
so the reform can not be carried out well .
the government is making efforts to change situation .
it really is . you have to wait a moment .
he is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
what ? it s only 9 p . m . now . why today he went to bed so early ?
he ran four miles and came back dead beat .
he was hurt .
i 'm tired of your cutanddried opinions . who do you think you are !
how dare you speak to me like this .
ok i will tell you .
ok . you know i 've tried to give me a presentation .
i knew this would happen some day . . .
you are so thoughtful .
the computers are the same as the old kid .
it must be dreadful to grow old .
it sure is . he has no one to turn to very miserable indeed .
have n't you heard that he is in prison ?
what ? beg your pardon .
john is in prison now . he was copped outstealing .
i just can n't believe my ears !
i ca n't deny that . she is so beautiful that i fell in love with her at the first sight . i wish i knew more about her .
but i heard that she had a threeyearold girl .
i can not belive that . it must be cooked up by someone .
of course i wo n't chill out . opportunity knocks only once .
you should strike while the iron is hot .
you 're right . i will have a talk to her about that .
really ? i thought he loved his wife very much .
yeah . but his relation with sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife .
he deserved it .

i m glad you re enjoying it .
thank you for the invitation .
it s my pleasure . would you like another glass of champagne ?
yes please . thank you for everything .
oh thank you so much .

i know . i always hope for the best and prepare for the worst .
then you will be in line for a doom .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
fine thanks . what 's the main reason ?
yes i have . that 's why i 'm interested in seeing a few people in chinese education .
it 's said that the chinese cake is well done . it 's probably the whole family 's favorite .

i really enjoy it .
yes but not only the primary school .
how could you tell me about the price ?
so have you been married for a year ?
what do you mean ?
we can discuss the matter first .
it 's so true . but it 's so many people involved in it .
me too . sometimes i agree with you on a lot of fun .
do people get married young ?
how did you want it to be in good condition ?
i think she s pretty .

ok i was hoping i could have a look in my opinion .
i think i 'll take this one .
i can also help you with the receipt .
no i m not .
i went to yale university .
did you ? and what did you study ?
i have a b . a . in economics .
would you mind telling me how old you are ?
i 'm twentyseven .
and could you tell me what other jobs you have had ?
yes i have worked in a bank for the last five years .
and what was your salary at the bank ?
i got 500 a week .
thank you . good evening mr . dean .
would you tell us your name please ?
i 'm helen baker .
glad to meet you ms . baker .
glad to meet you too .
where are you from ms . baker ?
i 'm from new zealand .
what do you do for a living ?
i m a doctor .
what do you teach ?
what s the problem ?
let 's have a look at the menu . oh there is n't a menu . do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu ?
i 'd rather you did but i 'm sorry .
we 're only on saturday so that i 'll have to go .
will that 'll be the sixth of september .
i d better write you in . we can visit more often .
thank you . can i cancel my reservation ?
thank you for your hospitality .
tomorrow night ?
i m sorry to hear that . why don t you come with me ?
as soon as possible .
ok . i ll talk to you about the time .
no i have n't but i 've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper .
ok . we should have a look at the site before but later .
i 'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the it field .
you have n't had any experience in either of those fields .
i know . but i 'd like to try . look here are some advertisements that i 've cut out .
i was turned down again . it s frustrating . i guess you ve got to teach me some skills .
me ? i m even less experienced than you are .
at least you know what american women generally like in a man .
believe it or not i guess american women like a man in good shape which chinese women may not care about so much . that s my honest opinion . i know you have been trying very hard .
american men are naturally taller than chinese men . so even if i exercise there aren t many chances .
no that s not true . i ve met two american women who were married to chinese . but those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is jacky chan ? he s small and short . but i bet he wants .
you know that s going to be a tremendous change for me . because i never exercise .
why don t you try then ? even if it doesn t help you find an american girl you could still have a stronger and healthier body . you won t lose anything by doing that .
hi don . what a surprise !
yeah i saw someone walking like you but i wasn t sure . we haven t seen each other for how long ? almost three months ? but you look quite different now .
have you noticed what has changed ?
oh you look quite slender and more <unk> . what have you been taking ? are you on a diet ?
yes . i m on a diet but i ve not taken anything . i just eat less and exercise more . and it really worked in the past three months . i ve lost twelve pounds .
wow ! that s great . i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals but it s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . also you know old habits are hard to break .
what kind of exercise do you think i do ? i just go to dance everyday after work . i m taking an amateur dance class . i dance two hours everyday .
dance ? that s not hard . i can do that . i 'm not feeling good .
sure . join my class next week .
ok . . . no problem !
it was no big deal .
i m not trying to make any difference now .
are you having a lot of money ?
what do you mean ?
would that be ok ?
oh that 's very kind of you . it 's not far from here i 'm looking for .
i want to go to a movies .
yes . after graduation i 'll make a master 's degree . i hope i can get a job as soon as possible .
no problem . here is the money .
well what do you say about the moment ?
that 's right . thanks for reminding me .
that 's a very good idea . could you tell me what the requirements are for ?
i think that we would be isolating our children from social interaction .
but it 's not even the opposite .
i 've been ok . perhaps you 'd like a new job .
i know what you mean . you 've done a lot of money .
i 'd rather go to the other side . i am thinking of the food pizza .
well i do n't think any planes are going anywhere . you have a high fever .
that 's true . i never heard of it .
well why don t you use a local sim card ?
i see . i ca n't stand having needles that are so attractive .
that will certainly cut down the work .
you seem to have everything ready . i have an important meeting !
nothing really .
coming up .
i know . hold on ! what a beautiful dress ! <unk> are you thinking of going to a costume and a little bit like ?
oh i know that .
it was a little strange that i came to the kitchen and i was quite a little bit of a room .
a nice day !
i know but i do n't really know how to set up the timer .
sounds reasonable . the tv station is about 1500 meters .
yes . you should keep it in mind .
i do n't want a big house .
that is n't very hot .
that s not what i asked for .
the <unk> . my sister loves it very much .
what are you going to do ?
no not really . but it 's saturday .
you have not heard that this was our first time .
great . is the office here ?
i 'm afraid that i 'm very ill .
that s fine . i can take my mom out of the house .
i can t believe you .
it 'll be about one hundred yuan for you .
how much does it cost ?
no problem at all but it costs 200 dollars .
maybe . i 'll just get there in time .
would you like to have dinner with me ?
but you seem to have them sent me by the end of this week .
okay . i ll pick you up around 6
could you tell me your name please ?
yeah it was a great pleasure .
well i have n't even been anywhere until the holidays are so popular .
no . i 'm lucky she set her feet .
well how can i put this ? france is a terrible team .
i thought i was going to do it .
i can tell you exactly what he does .
well i 'm afraid i have to buy some souvenirs .
it 's the reason i 'm really happy .
it 's true .
come on ! if you do n't know how to go to china our country the country will benefit from your health .
it 's a good idea . after all we will eat the money they have to buy some new candy .
well it 's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . so unfortunately you 'll lose this 50 rib . we 'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .
but it seems that they are getting used to it .
i 'm going to have the lab on the list .
it was n't too bad . i hate the job so i do n't think this .
is that true ? let 's call it a deal .
i was robbed .
what about the benefits ?
do n't worry . i 'll get to work at once .
well we will just have a guess when we will go out and find out .
are you sure that i 'll be promoted to them ?
a chess board ! daddy is going to teach you how to play !
i think that 's the way you can be more worried about it . the girl knows everyone is more capable and more about it .
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
what a great name is !
thank you . i am very happy to meet you .
well that s very specialized . so the insects and the flowers are blue .
the first thing in the house is a great house . i suppose you ll have to pick up your bedroom .
let s go about it this way .
what s the matter ?
well that s strange . it was a big birthday present from the city . they range every day and styles we ll have a guest time .
that 's right . but it 's really very expensive .
i see what it starts at the time of the country .
it 's a onebedroom onebathroom apartment .
yes . is it really that you could say ?
have you got a snack too ?
what is the price of this house ?
yes it 's fully furnished .
is there a desk ?
is it very expensive ?
how long does it take ?
have you talk to me about it ?
when will you give me a raise ?
it could be .
yes i do . if you ask around other people will tell you the same thing .
i think in some way it is an act of god but in another way it just is caused by us .
did you know that she was a very good manager ?
like for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
oh i see . fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things .
really ? that 's a straws in the wind .
i think so . maybe he 's fallen for her .
yeah . they suit each other . a perfect match between a man and a girl .
i do n't have it .
oh really ? you didn t have to . . .
oh you should have stayed over for dinner . . .
i agree with you on that . i am not a big fan .
but the food is so delicious . you should n't cook dinner at least .
what about the wine ?
yes . but i have to work at the overtime schedule .
thank you for your help .
i do n't feel like eating .
no that 's the only one we 've had for . i think we 'd rather go out the restaurant .
is that all right ?
i do n't really like chinese food . they taste very delicious .
well . so what about his son ?
i know baby is a good idea . so what do you think then ?
and how many do you have ?
that 's fate .
i feel sorry for her .
maybe this is god 's will .
we have two cleaning ladies . but both of them have received little education .
most cleaning ladies are illiterate . but some of them do a very nice job .
but i actually dislike another lady . she is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . but the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . she would tell you what to do and where to put things .
someone has stolen my cell phone .
why do n't you try to quit smoking ?
certainly i 'm going to ask you a question .
i do n't know . we provide a small rental fee at the same time .
i 've never thought about that before .
well we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . the trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the workout plan .
great idea . i suppose i 'll go with that .
since everyone is different your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . then you 'llbe taught all the necessary techniques to us
that 's really great . thanks for your advice .
it 's for free because we charge a 10 for one hour and the total is 16 . 50 .
perhaps one month . i 'll just have a try at first .
the situation is just too slow .
yes i like collecting things .
oh that s interesting and but what kind of things ?
several things for example various coins stamps stones and so on .
stones ? i know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?
yes stones .
well i can t just image it .
very well thank you . how is your family ?
that 's great . he 's a wife .
i 'm glad we 've sold out .
well our restaurant is very good .
but she also did n't have a chance to get your phone number .
she 's on a <unk> right now .
so have you been on the bus very long ?
i need to change my driver 's license .
dad that 's good girl .
boy this is the girl you 've ever tried .
yes it will be cool .
it 's true . what do you mean ?
i like variety shows .
it 's so hot .
what ? i thought you liked patricia .
oh shut up ! she 's not what you are thinking about .
do n't worry . no big deal . just a common cold .
the temperature is even colder this morning . how about you ?
let 's go see a ride .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that 's a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
thanks but i do n't know much about it .
oh . i know the ancient olympics has a very good reputation .
if i were you i would like to be a singer .
it 's a great idea . the band is a little old .
a terrific movie is very impressive . i see how it goes .
do you play some gifts ?
yes of course . but i am a student and i 'm a junior now .
because you do n't have the money and i could n't find it .
wow ! so what do you think i should do ?
it 's not easy . there is always one from the studying language . some people are very different from the studying .
i 'm not really sure .
about as well as you can see me after school i 'll leave the class .
you know . i was just friends .
yes that 's what i need .
i want to study english literature .
you are right . my husband is not the only one who has done this . they can t tell you the truth .
you 're such a wimp ! you 're afraid of an eyelash curler .
can you tell me the english is very impressive ?
thanks for your advice . i will need to know how you 're moving on .
yes it 's said that people can improve their chinese .
oh well . i heard this was quite the first two major version . but in the kitchen both the classroom for a few months .
it sounds a good idea . i will make it a formal affair .
sure . but you know that i ca n't read any chinese characters . what do they say ?
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
it 's interesting . i want to buy one home .
yes it deserves its name .
yes it deserves its name .
yeah it 's not very good . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it 's still very good .
so you 've got it . i 'll be sure that one fits you .
it 's interesting and i want to buy one home .
you might want to go to easy college .
i think it 's easy . the cigarettes should be before the holiday .
no . i heard that there are some leftover lasagna from the university .
what do the local internet access is on the internet ?
what 's your purpose of the meeting ?
do you have more work experience ?
do you know what the price is ?
i know it 's the radio you want .
hmm . that 's great . i 'll do it immediately .
ok but let 's find the shopping cart at the moment .
how can you tell me ?
certainly madam . i 'll get you a soft sleeper then .
you know there are a lot of good restaurants in the suburbs .
i do n't know . thank you very much .
the food there are actually pretty good .
yes i am going to put this one on the top floor .
well you have fun .
don t take that tone with me .
i ca n't see it .
you like the food there ?
what kind of milk do you like ?
you like the job ?
actually there are many countries in the national park .
a small bag ? why do we need that ?
no ! i thought that people say something like that !
yes it is . it has a fast meal but it is also very fast .
the view is breathtaking .
well they might as much as you can .
were there many tourist attractions in this city ?
for example you to play chess or on your computer . remember that the first time you need to avoid all your body using the chemicals .
are i a member of the book ?
yes our products are for the past two years .
well then i was in a very train .
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
can you describe the prices ?
yes . it 's a bit of boring . i can hardly remember .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i will pick you up at 6 o 'clock tomorrow morning .
you missed a lot of money !
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
i like all sorts of movies primarily drama and science fiction .
for sure . i like to have been discovered in the newspaper that i find difficult to read a good book .
yeah . it seems like we are not the same as far as movies are concerned .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
the notebook is this type of movie .
oh my god .
what are you going to do now ?
bill and betty have already grown up .
do n't worry . just a common cold .
look at that big tree over there .
yeah oh my god ! it s still there . we have our first date right on there .
do you know that i fell in love with you at the first sight then ?
you seemed to be dull at that time .
but we agreed to go out with you at about the next time .
smile i can t believe this for it s been 20 years since we got married .
i prefer the playing terrific . but i 'm afraid the air is fully booked .
it is . but i ve never seen the old man that is great . so are you still with it ?
excellent . today is extremely good .
well . so are you ready to see it the movie ?
well the traditional silk market is one of the most current products in the year . i guess the folks are still the same as the sales staff .
what other kind of food do you like ?
oh really ? it s wonderful to know the american woman on the third .
good for you . no problem i feel like watching movies .
yes well . at the moment can i ask the manager to help me ?
the <unk> is wonderful !
of course that 's what i thought .
what 's on tonight ?
i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
ok . here 's my ticket and the change .
wow it was good . so how did you like it ?
but she is not a fine wether friend who could sell you down the river .
i must tell you what she 's doing .
yes . she must be very skiing in a teacher .
it 's martin <unk> . you liked his film the departed did n't you ?
good idea . he is a womanizer .
you 're right . he sure the president has an outstanding president .
yes . that 's right .
oh i think it 's very romantic .
there s so much i want to do . i ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . i just ran a search for music to download .
i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
thanks . that would be very helpful . i ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . there s too much information on the net .
when you sent your emails did you attach any files to them ?
yes i did . there s an antivirus programme with my email account that <unk> all attachments so i m sure i haven t sent anything nasty to anyone .
when you use the internet be careful not to give out your email address very often . if you do you might get a lot of <unk> email form companies trying to sell you things .
that s good advice . i should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself such as my password and credit car number .
that s right . another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time
how do i do that ?
take this web page for example . press the keys control and d together . click on favourites at the top of the screen . there you are . it has been added to you favourites list . if you click it you will
that s useful to know . thanks . i ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .
really ? i m not sure that i would like all the attention . there have been numerous cases of paparazzi <unk> with star s private live in recent years .
i love being <unk> ! if i were famous i d do interviews for all the top magazines like cosmo and elle .
i wouldn t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice but it would get tedious after a while . imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you .
noone really believes gossip columnists .
i think you ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . you d also have to be very careful about every word you said . if you <unk> on a chat show and said something silly it
i think you re right about that . i d need a good manager to be my <unk> . i could do a lot of charity work which would help a lot of people .
that s a great idea . which charities would you support ?
yes i love children as you know so probably a children s charity .
you d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity so you d really need to be very careful . anyway i d attend your first to buy your posters and i d attend your first book
thanks very much .
yes it is . thanks . i m just surfing on the internet .
here ? in this cafe ? how can you do that ?
this cafe offers a wireless internet connection . that means i can get on the net for free while i m here ! of course i have to buy a cup of coffee !
that s great . can you do it anywhere ?
no . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . there are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
so what programs do you have on your laptop ?
i ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs .
i know you are keen on photography . it s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone anywhere at a
it s wonderful isn t it ? would you like to see some photos that i took recently ?
yes i do . i also use an antispyware program and a firewall . there are so many <unk> on the internet and so many <unk> on the internet and so many <unk> . you have to be very c
how often do you run your antivirus program ?
i usually run it every few days . it finds a virus about half the time .
which antivirus program would you recommend ?
have you tried this one ? it s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . you can also download updates for free .
that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ?
just a minute . . . go to this one . i ll send you an email with the line in it . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the set up procedures . but they are not complicated .
what do you use your computer for ?
i use it for several thingssurfing the net word processing and creating presentations . i don t play many games on my computer but i do a lot of work with photographs . using a computer program you
computers are great aren t they ? i should download some programs and learn how to use them .
i use it almost every day but i usually only use it almost every day . i usually only use it almost never goes to a virus .
yes . i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . it can be frustrating when the connection is poor .
so you re online eight hours a day .
yes i like the job though . sometimes i help other people in the office if they re having trouble online .
how useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?
i think it s fairly useful but there are two big problems . first a lot of the information you find online is false . second when you buy something online you don t see it until you actually get it .
how do you solve the website problems when you re buying something online ?
what i do is find the website of shops . then someone from our company <unk> the shop and buys when they re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .
i d say the main reason is poverty . countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . if their neighbors have some resources they try to steal them by military force .
it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end .
how do you think they could be ended ?
i don t think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . the thing is to find the real pro
so if the cause is poverty there should be a programme to make the country richer . if the problem is resources share them .
it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality it s harder to make peace between countries .
yes . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .
the problem is that many poor people might suffer .
would you like to live in the country ? i m not sure i d like it .
i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that for me each advantage has its own disadvantage .
i understand that . but it would look a little worried about it .
well how can i put this ? france is a terrible team .
you re right . i love being too far away from the city centre . there is a problem with someone i can t stand or the city centre but i would be glad to get away with you .
people can t have it both ways . if you live in a city it is often less convenient . if you live in a city it is noisy buy there s more to do .
i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they re so much better to look at than concrete rows of parked cars and tall buildings .
i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . when the wind blows in the city you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .
the view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . there s so sign of pollution . the village looks so peaceful .
just remember that in that village there s nothing to do . there s not even a pub or restaurant . there s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .
you re right . i would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . i would hate living in the country !
i know not . i 'm so angry .
no i m a nurse .
i can t believe it .
i think you should give it a shot . it 's about time .
perhaps . you considered the gift for a bribe for a higher grade .
no kidding .
like for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
do you know how many people paid for it ?
why not ! it s a classic in fact it s one of my favorite novels .
but it s so old .
don t judge a book by its cover . do you kwon what it s about ?
no not at all .
first of all it s a romance novel set in the early 19th century .
i didn t realize it was a romance novel . what s the main storyline ?
it s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .
why does he want to do that ?
since he doesn t have a son he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . that way all of his daughters will be cared for .
won t they get his inheritance ?
no that s the problem . though they are welloff once he dies his house will go to his cousin . so when he dies the girls will have nothing .
i see . this sounds interesting ! maybe my teacher isn t so horrible after all .
so are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
there s movie ? my teacher didn t tell me that !
that s probably because she wants you to read the book first .
it would take a lot less time . .
how about this . when you finish the book . i ll get the movie and watch it with you .
ok . that sounds like a deal .
i only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . i don t think that tv is bad for kids . i think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes .
perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first .
if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch remember to have something else for them to do . if you don t they ll get bored and misbehave .
they could go out and play with their friends .
sure . you could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time .
perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . he watches too much tv too .
that s a good idea . remember that if the parents watch too much tv the kids will probably follow suit .
i like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . but i don t like traveling to work waiting for buses or . .
or getting stuck in traffic jams when you re driving .
i think something must be done .
it 's gone with the wind .
why do you like it best ?
i enjoy the various characters and the plot .
well . i like the thorn birds best .
and the fight says he is too sick to play the game .
sure . i get a lot of information and make many friends .
if i have a chance i 'll enjoy the book .
would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
that 's a good idea . let 's go !
it 's the best seller everyone 's been talking about for the last six months .
how in the world did you get a copy ? i 've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i 'm still waiting my turn .
i checked it out of the rental library . it only costs five cents a day .
is it really worth paying for ?
i ca n't tell yet . i have n't got beyond the first chapter .
if it 's any good i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
not a great deal .
i 've just been reading an article about them . they ll be used for all sorts of things now .
for accounting system and things like that you mean ?
yes but they are used for other things too . do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to paris .
but did you have to change the ticket ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
of course his machine must have been connected to a computer .
oh did he ?
too bad . i can t take the theory of a lady that kind of thing .
did you think that many kids in the exam ?
well how can i put this ? france is a terrible team .
of course you can . it 's a very difficult teacher .
mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
oh what s he like ?
well he s got dark hair and brown eyes .
does he mean to be a dark brown eyes ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
um that s good .
yes but he s got a wife and 3 children as well .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .
what happened ? you look so pale .
it 's the end of the world for me .
do you work here ?
i do n't see anything wrong with what we 're doing ! that 's just the problem . in these kind of things the trouble does n't always appear at first .
oh that 's too bad . work harder next term .
b i 'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me .
do n't lose heart . everything will be fine .
here 's my baggage .
yes of course . this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
i m glad you re enjoying it .
thank you for the invitation .
it s my pleasure . would you like another glass of champagne ?
yes please . thank you for everything .
sorry i can t .
tomorrow night then ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
that s sounds great .
ok . how about give me a ring then ?
no . i d better not .
what about your family ?
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
i m looking at my horoscope for this month ! my outlook is very positive . it says that i should take a vacation to someplace exotic and that i will have a passionate summer fling !
what are you talking about ? let me see that . . . what are <unk> ?
it s a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign . you have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . i was born on april 15th so i m an aries . when were you born ?
january 5th .
let s see . . . you re a capricorn . it says that you will be feeling stress at work but you could see new exciting developments in your love life . looks like we ll both have interesting summers !
that s bogus . i do n't feel any stress at work and my love is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
no it s not your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . see ? it says that an aries is energetic and loves to socialize .
well you certainly match those criteria but they re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ?
a capricorn is <unk> and practical . she likes to do things in conventional ways . that sounds just like you !
ok ! how about <unk> ?
no a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . i m going to describe someone s face and you guess who it is !
alright then . i guess i ll get you another one .
let me put your cases into the trunk and please get in the back .
our cousin pete ! my turn ! she has a <unk> nose <unk> eyes and a mole on her chin !
aunt rose ! that mole is so huge ! ok my turn . he has a crooked nose and full lips . he has quite a few freckles and an oval face . oh he is also bald !
your future husband !
not funny .
i 'm getting dressed what does it look like ?
mumm . no .
it s only the day when the world s biggest sporting event is kicking off .
it s older than that two countries have got married to stop the event and fight for their football matches .
you gotta have some better deodorant .
i have no idea what you re talking about . the only sporting event we watch at home is the super bowl .
this is bigger than the super bowl man ! teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . they first start in a group stage with bigger groups each g
sounds interesting but soccer doesn t really appeal to me .
are you kidding ? over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup ! it s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! each nation is cheering on their team hoping they will bec
what about the sports channel ?
whatever i m going to go watch the opening match .
mine was ok except that no one in my class speaks english . i guess it will force me to <unk> in chinese more in class so at least i should improve a lot this semester .
that s both fortunate and unfortunate . it s the united nations in my class ! we have people from all over the world ! there are three germans a pole a scottish two french an american a brazilian
that s quite the array of nationalities . everyone in my class is from asia except me . there are a few south koreans several japanese malaysian thai singaporean filipino kazakhstan and o
well i think you re pretty lucky actually . you ll have the opportunity to learn so much about asian culture .
i guess so but i think it s going to be hard to relate to my classmates especially with the language barrier . i think i might change classes .
don t ! stay the course ! your spoken chinese will be eternally grateful . i bet you it !
i highly doubt it . your girlfriend is chinese .
well there is that yes .
it s nice but i m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! ok kids put on your sunscreen while your mom and i set up a nice night !
there we go . can you help me with the umbrella ? perfect .
ok kids here <unk> beach ball and a frisbee a pail and a shovel . i want to see an impressive <unk> by the time we leave . don t stray too far . wait ! leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes
and stay in the shallow area . i don t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! it s too deep out there and we didn t bring your floatier .
you re back already ? the water was too cold huh ? i ll tell you a secret . do you see that small pool of water over there ? it ll be warmer in there . go see if you can find some seashells or catch some
what is that ? a jellyfish ? jeremy put that down right now !
ah ! not on me ! ow !
i want to think of it for some time .
i do !
what are you talking about ?
ha ! it looks like you re getting married . i bought this evening .
she is a very beautiful girl .
you re really all right .
no one thousand at the moment .
well we ve got a very active retirement . we should be fine with her .
yes it does look a bit sore . let s take your extra way of your chest and give you a few tests .
yes that sounds very interesting .
oh while we 're on the subject what happened to you and your secretary ?
well . we re going to get married next week .
we accept a spot and as our business relations . i also know a little about the leading company or a wide selection of <unk> in the company .
oh you know what the problem is . i ll put in the car one so you ll have to pay the bill .
oh no . i broke your vase accidentally .
what did you talk about ?
you mean all the time ? i have no idea how you go about that .
that s an excellent idea . you can have a good idea .
well you 're right . the first time we will be making you a big wedding .
that s the way you can t go to any other country .
great . i m glad you give me a second .
thanks a lot . i m flying home from my apartment soon .
it 's the most classic girl i 've had in mexico once . it 's a huge neighborhood .
hey ! i just knew i 'd do n't feel like walking alone !
thanks . i 'll try it as soon as possible .
yeah . you know what really works .
what do you mean ? i m a business relationship .
where ?
over here !
i was robbed .
ben we re fifteen . what kind of job are you looking for ?
oh just for a position as a gas station attendant . you know starting at a simple lowly job just like all the greats before they made it big in the world .
uhhuh .
but i m just in it for the money right ? how else am i going to be able to afford to keep taking angela to the movies ? besides i love the smell of gasoline don t you ?
yeah ? you finally decided to wipe the slate clean ?
you got it ! i have a new job i m living in a new city with new friends ! this is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way i live my life .
so what are you going to do ? take up an art class or something ?
well first of all i ve decided to stop smoking . it s not that i m pinching pennies or anything it s just that i ve been smoking since i was sixteen and i think it s time to stop .
i m with you on that one . anything else you re planning on doing ?
one last thing i ve decided to come out of the closet .
it s about time !
i know you re darn right .
it is true . i ll try my best to kiss you when i am hired .
don t worry about that myself . you re just a cold .
ok ! let s go !
well i m just thinking of taking it easy . i know you have to just leave it .
whatever you say .
i m so glad i can help .
what else did you find ?
a glass of white wine would be great .
do you want to take milk and sugar ?
i 'll go back to <unk> .
i think i like the black one .
could i have some water ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i do n't know . what do you think ?
i 'm giving you a ticket for this .
well do you want to go see a movie ?
thank you for coming .
me too . it 's been a long time .
it 's easy . i 'll call the police as soon as i can .
yeah . i love you to invite me .
many thanks for your present .
do n't mention it . it s my pleasure .
i usually go to bed around my house and have something good news .
what do you think of the beautiful house ?
it 's a lot better than paying someone 60 .
i will . you know as a newcomer i think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere .
that 's great .
i do n't know . let 's check out the fruit section first .
no i want to .
ok . good idea .
really ? you will be successful .
how many will traveling be ?
i do n't know . i am going to be like it .
i like the weather but i do n't like the cold .
i 'm so sorry for the inconvenience .
yes i find jogging does good to me so i keep on doing it .
you 've formed a sound habit .
i 've had one problem of these days .
i do n't want to hear it anyway . in fact i am broke up to my country .
i 'm glad to hear that .
just one . we re friends .
i ca n't movie . i 'm already very sorry .
i need a car .
i agree . well i think it 's too boring for me to say just now .
well you did n't watch the movie you wanted to see ?
i did n't like it very much . when it comes to see all the different movie and the plot was really interesting .
that s a good idea . it could take three hours .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
i know you are right . it 's not fair .
that 's good . shall we try some fish ?
have you heard of the local news ?
no . i ca n't cook anything .
i like him very much .
who film is so popular ?
he 's really reserved a double bed .
i 'd like to have tea with me .
what 's the matter with you ?
about 2 years ago .
yes . i have already sent over to my office before i make an appointment .
well i have n't got a lot of business so i can teach you .
ok . i will do it . thanks for the info .
hi john ! i have n't seen you for ages .
yeah i 've been out of town .
so how have you been ?
great ! work is really busy now but it 's fun .
i 've lost my wallet . it s in my room .
see you later .
really ? how do you think about it ?
ok . let s go .
hey andrew . how 's everything with work ?
ok i guess . my boss has been on my back recently .
really ? what 's he been doing ?
you know just giving me lots to do . i 'm really busy right now .
are you ? what are you busy with ?
oh lots of things . mostly training new people .
anyway we wo n't have the courage in the baseball .
we can do it all afternoon .
those are really good .
you want to watch don t you ?
that 's fine . have a good day .
oh thank you . what a pity .
that will solve it then .
i was robbed this morning .
when did you say ?
do n't feel like it .
because i want to tell you the truth .
i 'll give you the watch .
yeah i think so . oh by the way i need to ask you something .
it 's kind of you to say . but . . .
it 's the automatic teller machine .
sure . oh that reminds me . could i borrow your black leather boots ?
my boots ? er . . . sure ok .
i 'd like to go to tianjin .
that s really nice .
that was wonderful . you should have been there .
you are so kind .
i have no idea . but she ended up finding out later .
wow what are you looking for ?
well thanks . you re a pretty satisfied customer .
hmm . maybe that makes sense .
george how can we ? vacations cost money . and this month we don t have much money left after paying the rent .
well lili we can visit different places in the state in our van . we are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . trust me it won t cost much .
where will we sleep then ?
in the van .
what about other expenses ?
let s see . gas food recreation we won t spend much . come on . don t hesitate . we need to get out of the house once in a while . we have been working hard haven t we ?
maybe you re right . when do you plan to go ?
the sooner the better ! i can t wait !
oh i don t know where we re going yet .
as long as we re going you can decide where to go . i trust your <unk> . i know you miss chinese food so we can eat at a chinese restaurant this time .
let s go to chicago . we can have lunch in chinatown . then we can go to a ball game at <unk> field !
ok ! let s take a look at it .
i found the ideal position . i m working for a plumbing company .
are you serious ? you studied mathematics at college for four years and now you have a job working with your hands !
plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge and creativity . i love this job .
i can see that . but i didn t know you had experience in that line of work .
i didn t but i applied for an apprenticeship and since i studied math and i have a good attitude 4 my application was accepted .
congratulations ! you do have the right attitude .
oh did you have to take it again ?
you need to type your pin in .
i don t know a good ethiopian restaurantmeskerem . i m looking forward to share the sunshine .
did you want to go see a movie ?
in order to eat some chicken and take a look .
i understand . it is nice that you will have the easy questions in college .
i 'm a good team player .
you have a bad idea .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
yes i like it very much .
what kind of sports do you like best ?
i nearly need a computer games . i have good dj .
do you play some weight ?
i know they are my best friend at school .
that s good advice . i ll try it .
palmistry ? what is that ?
it 's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future .
oh you mean palm reading . i 've seen that before but i do n't believe in it .
are you sure ? i 've read a lot about palmistry and i 've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . do you want me to take a look at your hand ?
really ? you 've read books about it ? ok then . but only if you want to .
ok let 's see well you 've got a long life line which is good and the love line is strong . . .
what else do you see ? will i be successful ? will i make a lot of money ?
hmm hard to say wait yes it looks like you will do well in business and your ambition will help you a lot but . . .
what ? what is it ? what 's the matter ?
you seem to have a large gullibility line . you believe everything that you 're told .
i 'm sorry . i thought she would have been on a hard time .
no not really . why do you ask ?
because i want to tell you about the time that i saw a ghost .
you saw a ghost ? when ?
it was many years ago when i was a little child . it was the middle of the night and i went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . i walked out of the kitchen and was at the top of the stairs when .
so that 's where you saw the ghost ? in your house ? what did it look like ? was it hideous ?
it was a big green thing that looked like a person . it was in the kitchen and it slowly moved towards the stairs . .
what did the kitchen say ?
i hid so that it could n't see me . slowly it got closer and closer until . .
until what ? what happened ? did you see it clearly ? did it attack you ?
it moved slowly up the stairs step by step and i could hear its approaching footsteps . when it finally got to the top of the stairs i realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . he had gone to get a late night snack .
i just found out that my husband is cheating on me .
you mean mark ? he seems like such an honest guy .
that 's what i thought . it seems that he 's been seeing someone else for about two months .
two months ? how did you find out ?
i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . i picked it up and a girl asked to talk to mark . she then asked if i was his sister and i said no i was his wife .
so you asked him about the girl who called ?
yeah he first said it was someone from work . he gave me a lame excuse and so i pressed him on it .
what 'd he do ?
he kept trying to make stupid excuses and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion .
what a jerk .
yes you asking me to make a deposit .
if you were told her that she would teach him or her longer .
i m sorry . he doesn t have enough time to worry about me .
thanks . i 've always been wanting to help .
so what is it ? oh this is my first day . i am not a child .
i exercise is much better than mine .
so maybe i should look at some medicine .
that s my mother . what kind of exercise do you think i should get ?
wow . i guess i ll be able to do that .
maybe . but some of my chinese friends are getting better .
well it s not the only thing i ve ever got is it .
sounds dangerous . i guess i can do a sport
nothing much .
well that 's probably true . but it 's important to have a taste of chinese food . i should say it is really good for you .
well i 'm afraid i have a look at the apartment .
it 's <unk> . but in the three months the were injured .
how do you make such a <unk> ?
why do n't you go to the beach ?
i know you mean enjoy the movie .
in what way ?
how do you pay for it ?
i 'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments .
tell me if you need help .
no i am not eating there anymore . i have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . the food served in the cafeteria is not my type . i am a total meat lover . but the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . they have been serving the chinese cabbage and
that s fine with me . i don t hate vegetables and i don t eat much during lunch .
well then the cafeteria suits you best . but anyway if you like to have a lunch outside the company feel free to join me anytime .
i 'm going to graduate this summer .
where are you going to work then in australia or back in china ?
i 'm planning to return to china after graduation .
why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad .
well i think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment .
yeah china 's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country .
of course ! it is the no . 1 <unk> in my life . you know job stress has become a very common problem these days . so we must learn to cope with it .
totally agree . what is your solution ?
well there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress both we and the companies should do something . for me i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know all work and no play make jack a dull boy .
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
but i don t think we can change our working condition . anyway we are not the bosses .
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them like <unk> <unk> <unk> deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
it was n't the first time . he was almost new york times .
that s true . what are the symptoms ?
yes they had no reason for arresting me .
right so the deposit if you do n't mind my asking ?
what do the sales do ?
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i am impressed with how smart and humorous .
yes next march .
in the same way .
good for you .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
good night . i wish you a good night .
great . that 's going to be out of five minutes . i 'll tell you the truth .
why do we go there ?
your usual shirt and shoes .
well that is is nice .
i know . i think it may rain .
the heel is a little tight .
that 's what you 're going to eat .
so what were you calling me about ?
so you will be hearing from us in a couple of days .
i 'm serious .
good luck out .
i like it for that suggestion .
yes . i know and hot food as well as other food are a little spicy food .
you know that is a really light weight .
i want to recommend this one . can you give me some discount ?
i never drink alcohol coffee or tea .
i am afraid i do n't like it .
follow me into the kitchen . you will love it .
you 're right . i just wish it were a waste of time and money .
eight hundred and fifty cents .
i 'm okay . i 'll try it . the <unk> s nothing serious .
i had my first cigarette when i was 17 .
i guess that would be the best choice . i could n't remember .
take the next right . drive about one click further and you ll see the entrance of the highway to the great wall .
oh i see . she wo n't know anything about this .
supervisor . open the door .
give me a hand .
sorry mum i 'll do it right away .
sure there is a service charge . just a little extra for your background .
let 's go into the restaurant .
is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ?
i would n't mind a burger .
no i 've never been there .
gee you do n't get a ticket . you have to go to the gym .
oh come on !
it 's a basketball match .
when did you come ?
i have n't heard about that . he 's really depressed .
ok . then tell me what do you want .
i wish that the high jump is too high !
what do you think about it ?
if he knew that his cup cup cup would be a good thing .
i got a lot of things . what are you getting on ?
yes . i have lost about ten kilos .
what dress size do you wear ?
sorry but he 's busy then too .
that s fantastic . i ll call the police now and get back to you .
you 'd better cool yourself down first .
i like spring .
i prefer summer especially the summer evenings . when the sun comes down it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . after a rain shower the smell of the air is refreshing . it is also a best reason for icecream .
how do you get through the stuffy daytime ?
well i have to hide in the airconditioned rooms . anyway it is all worth just think about the cool evening time .
fantastic ! i enjoy clubbing especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad full of smoke and the music is too loud so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
how did that happen ?
a wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . if i had drunk enough and i would have had the bold to punch him in the face .
sounds cool ! but that is not what a lady should do . people are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk .
oh that would be lovely !
but it 's friday . you are not going to work overtime are you ?
right . and what about your career ?
no i did n't . i watched television .
why do n't you speak english ?
china .
really ? you don t look very chinese to me if you don t mind me saying so .
the score was 10198 .
wonderful !
anne ! i have n't seen you for ages . how 've you been ?
just fine . and you ?
not bad . it really is great to see you again . w here have you been ?
i just got back from london .
better take the subway . it s faster and more convenient .
en where do we pay the fares ?
we have a rather comprehensive subway system here . you can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy .
it will be very convenient .
follow me please .
oh i know that . by the way when can i get out of the platform after i get off the train ?
cash credit card or debit card ?
you can take the subway to the square .
i am really the manager .
yes you do . here you are .
is that so ? i did n't know it . can i possibly borrow a jacket and a tie ?
i am sorry you ca n't borrow a jacket and a tie .
then we 'll return to the hotel and come back will you change the appointment ?
certainly what time do you come back ?
at 7 please .
the total for the second is ten .
a party of 13 .
i was just wondering what party that you were planning on going to ?
er . . . hum . . . got it .
then open that window . yeah that one .
right !
i 'm getting a little short on cash .
i see what you mean . that was pretty easy after all .
no . please feel free .
oh is it ? thank you anyway .
you are welcome . please press the button when you need any help .
that s when i was a child .
i just lost my job . my boss just told me .
that 's unbelievable . why did this happen ?
i do n't understand of myself . it seems they have to save money .
i cant't believe it . you 've worked here for years .
i 've lost my wallet . it s in my room .
see you later .
really ? how do you think about it ?
ok . let s go .
yes . put it on my resume please .
well congratulations .
where shall we go now ?
emm . . . yes . but i was n't too impressed . i found her a little stuck up .
you are kidding but she 's so helpful .
tom . . . you are her boss you down . of course she 's helpful to you .
come on . she 's like that with everyone .
i do n't think so actually . she never even says hello to me .
thank you . but a number of things have been going wrong lately .
that 's too bad . what problems are you having .
oh the whole house needs repainting for starters . the carpet in the living room is worn out and i 'd like to put in new walltowall carpeting . last week i had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . anyway all par for the course when you own a house i guess . i think i am going to hire an interior <unk> to look the place over .
i 've studied home decoration as a hobby . could i make some suggestions ?
sure . what kind of chinese food are you interested in ?
i like what i see .
wow you really do have a talent for this alice . thanks for the suggestions .
you are welcome jack . glad to be of help .
no i did n't . he bad told me that i could n't make it .
do you have the job ?
yes i agree . the applause ! that was what kept the show .
you re right . well maybe they can meet each other and fight over it .
hello is that stefan ?
please allow me to introduce myself . my name is tom .
pleased to meet you . my name is alice . did you just move in next door ?
yes i did . have you lived here long ?
me ? i guess so . i 've lived here for about six years now . have you lived in america very long ?
no not really . when i left vietnam i came to america and i lived with a cousin in dallas for two years . where do you work alice ?
i teach mathematics at a college . what do you do ?
i am an accountant at a company .
well tom . it 's good to meet you . i have to go now . i am teaching a class this evening and i need to get to the college .
it 's nice meeting you too alice .
see you around !
goodbye alice .
thank you . it 's a pleasure to meet you .
a pleasure meeting you as well the flowers are for you .
thank you they are beautiful .
you 're right . but you know it 's hard to give up a shot . i just feel tired from a <unk> .
i do n't know . that 's why you did n't stop smoking .
you mean <unk> ?
sure then . i 'll make sure she is ready .
have you got a temperature ? it 's been really hot lately .
yes i know a doctor .
i am really sorry to hear that .
it 's very kind of you to here .
you are right . my wife will be doing great .
it 's important to have lunch now .
so what ? that s unusual !
i did n't have a watched of television .
did you have something on your mind ? you look so concerned ! maybe i can help you .
well i 'm under a lot of pressure . my boss is very pushy . he assigned me two projects . now the deadlines are near and i still have n't finish one of them .
is there anything i can do for you ?
yeah . i was looking for a pair of gloves .
my boss <unk> me . i ca n't eat a drink .
did you bring a prescription ?
i believe that two people did get hurt .
alright . you have to have a heart attack !
for almost two years .
all right !
how did you learn to use the ear ?
well suffer then . if you have a toothache you have to go to the dentist .
i do n't have an insurance policy but we have to pay part of the claim .
yeah the government really takes a bite doesn t it ?
it definitely is . the government could provide some money yourself if you want .
yeah i know it 's just the right . we ll both end up rich <unk> and not need it but what if we do you know ?
yeah . it won t be much but at least we ll have a monthly check when we get old .
oh my god . my grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive .
let s just hope the politicians don t figure out a way to spend it .
really ? no they couldn t . none of them would have jobs if they did .
well not exactly . i have seen some great suggestions .
what was it going to be ?
i think i had a lot of experience in the movie .
of course not help yourself .
i m jack . what s your name ?
laura .
do you like this place ?
i don t think it s very nice . and my father doesn t like it . but my mother likes it very much . so we often come here .

your wet towel sir .

i grow a variety of things so that something is in bloom all year round .

it looks best in spring when the plum and cherry blossoms are out .
i think we are going to stay in europe .
good night then .
i am going to the railway station .

i m going to live on a lake .
tasha mountain ? it 's very famous in china .
air mail .
my house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture .
no wonder you look so upset . have you called the police ?
yes . but i have to wait .
i know what you mean . i love the winter and the air .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
it was a very good place to be there .
what could you do after that ?
well how can i put this ? france is a terrible team .
do you think it 's going to happen ?
it 's beautiful . enjoy it while it lasts . it 's supposed to get cold tomorrow .
what 's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
the weatherman says it 's going to snow tomorrow .
that does n't sound pretty .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
well i was going to drive to birmingham to see some friends .
you might want to change your plans . with the cold and wet weather that we 're supposed to have tomorrow the roads are going to be rather slippery .
i suppose i should . i do n't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
i just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
if you 're lucky it 'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !
if that happens then i 'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
i wish it was a pleasant choice but people do n't have much time to drink .
great . i 'll see you on saturday .
english weather is even more predictable than i had previously thought .
no i m sorry . i m late .
fine . what about going to have lunch with us ?
i 'm getting dressed what does it look like ?
how old is he today ?
it 's his 50th birthday .
well wish him a happy birthday for me .
sure thing . what are your plans for the evening ?
i was just thinking of going to a movie tonight .
well if you can wait until tomorrow night i 'll go with you then .
sorry i 've got people coming over tomorrow night .
sounds like this weekend just is n't going to work out for us .
that sounds that way . maybe some other time then ?
sure . hey i 'm sorry but i 've got to get going .
yeah me too . it 's about time i made a move .
say hello to your friends for me .
likewise . see you later .
ok then let 's say goodbye .
it 's beethoven . do you like it ?
i think beethoven's music is incredible . i 've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent too . do you believe that ?
i do n't know about that but i do think that it helps people relax .
what other kind of music do you listen to ?
actually i mostly just listen classical music . what about you ?
to be honest i think classical music is too complicated for me .
what kind of music do you prefer then ?
i like pop music . do you ?
not really . i do n't think pop music has much depth .
i see what you mean . i think that 's way i like it so much .
how long have you been in to pop music then ?
i 've always been into it . have you always liked classical music ?
not really . when i was little we did n't really listen to music at all .
so how did you become interested in it ?
well when i was about 10 years old i started playing the piano . i think that 's how it all started .
do you still play piano ?
yes it 's one of my hobbies .
what kind of movie is it ? i don t like many of his movies actually .
it s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead .
i like thrillers and i like julia roberts so it might be interesting . i read a review today and the critic didn t seem to be very impressed .
what did the critic say ?
he didn t say it was bad but he said that it wasn t as good as it could have been particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it .
the movie starts at eight o clock so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
good . dinner is nearly ready and i d like to watch the news before we go . the oscars were last night and i want to see the results .
i won t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . there were a few surprises .
i like current affairs programs and documentaries especially wildlife ones . how about you ?
i like those kinds of programs too . they re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
i agree . people often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence .
yeah . and that s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !
right . you can t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . they need to make money from advertisements for drugs .
i see . in my country i d like to buy the tickets for the train .
that s great idea . but don t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?
no . they don t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ?
not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! that s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv where you pay a fixed amount each month .
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country but people don t seem to keen to pay for their tv programs . besides the <unk> channels offer a good range of programs .
i think it s a good idea to read the newspaper .
it s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . i play the part of the detective . he has to catch the killer but there s very little evidence . it s a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes but i hope audience won t be too scared to go to the movie theatres !
did you enjoy making the movie ? we heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director .
i have had disagreement with every director . i ve worked with . we ve always <unk> in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . it was the same when i made this movie . i don t know where <unk> of my disagreement with rachel kelly come from . we got on very well and i hope to work with her again .
critics are not very happy with the movies that you ve made recently . does that bother you ?
not at all . the feedback from audience has been great . i care about what they think more than what the critics think .
did you do you own stunts in the movie ?
i wanted to but my insurance company wouldn t let me . all of my stunts were done by a <unk> . as you know i used to do my own stunts but i ll leave that to the experts in future .
thank you very much for doing this interview .
my pleasure . have you seen the movie yet ?
yes . i have . like you a very much . i liked it .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
i guess someday . i 'm too busy to stop smoking and stop by not as good as possible .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
yes i experienced one when i was in tokyo once . the tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over .
do you know where it measured on the richter scale ?
i do n't remember but it was n't very serious . have you ever been in an earthquake ?
no but i was in quite a few tornados when i was younger .
have you ever experiences a flood ?
i 'm from china . what about you ?
did your house ever get damaged from the winds ?
most of the time we were lucky but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room .
wow that must have really been scary .
actually some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass .
have n't they been able to go abroad ?
no but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
that sure did n't last long !
i 'm pretty good you ?
what happened to him ?
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
was it his first offence ?
unfortunately not . he was charged with a <unk> when he was in university .
what happened to him then ?
not much it was a minor offence back then . he got away with a fine of 500 .
did they take his license away ?
no they were really easy on him . the problem is that that was a long time ago . they are much tougher on crime now .
what do you think will happen to him ?
well he 'll definitely lose his license pay a fine and maybe even spend some time in jail .
that does n't sound too promising . does he have a defence lawyer ?
not yet . if we ca n't find a lawyer for him then the state will appoint him with one .
my sister is a lawyer . i can ask her if she can help him .
that 'd be great ! i know he 'd appreciate your help .
i think housing is a big problem . i just ca n't seem to win the problem .
how would the problem be ?
i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .
it would probably be very expensive .
i think the government can afford it . besides there are many advantages . homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement .
it s not a bad idea . i think education is the biggest problem at the moment . schools don t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly .
if we are to invest more money to education we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn t be popular with voters .
most voters what everything bout ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things but without increasing taxes .
the government should show that it is using money efficiently . in other countries want to pay the risk of a claim for food and earn .
yes . the government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly .
it 's fantastic !
yes . i called you last month .
but they are the most common <unk> .
that means i can buy one for free .
because they are the best for them . but i think women would like to buy them for me .
yes . i 'll take the tapestry the set of the salty dish .
no . the most important thing is that no one has service in the company .
i know that i could be a lie .
your tax is out .
yes . i think the quality of the song is better . . it 's one of the most rich customers have .
i think all the cartons of themselves are the most important thing . they all want to make money for them .
but a lot of chinese enterprises are trying to buy the health and increase their age .
well some woman does . they have to pay some attention to how much money they will come up for you .
yes we do .
i really knew there was a big choice but i could n't just look like them .
well now we 're stuck in a traffic jam . what can you do ?
i know i am going to get a virus .
i see . i am terribly sorry .
just a moment . i 'll check for you .
what was he wearing ?
well i didn t have to pay enough to get the rent .
well now we 're stuck in a traffic jam .
actually why not ? what 's that ?
what do you mean ? . it 's hard to get a better price .
yes i do . my first place is probably better than cooking .
how much is it ?
i 'm not sure yet .
you changed jobs ?
yes . i have . i think we 've put a few pounds on the wall .
that 's what i see .
yes i can do that if you like me .
i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
well i think i will buy a house . what can we do ?
it 's a good thing .
that 's great . i 'm really glad you could help me out .
here you go honey fried eggs .
what 's the matter ? it 's a pity .
the one . on the floor .
did you think about it ?
if you could pick him out of the lineup he has to take you to the hospital .
i think it 's a really good place to go there .
well if you tell me to him i 'll call him and meet you at the airport .
how many stops do you have ?
he 's looking at the advertisement in an <unk> . he has already been an <unk> with his famous film at the office .
well then what are your spoils ?
i need to make a statement at the police station .
i guess you 're right . if you want to do a little gardening you can .
let me see . the position is 90 dollars per piece of white in the universe with a band at least 10 words a month from our friends who can be delivered before the end of every day .
you do n't have to tell me that .
good question . i have to think about it .
and you think about her ?
that 's something i wanted to go to !
good question . i have to think about it .
good question . i have to think about it .
good question . i think i should have to think about it .
how much is the tape record ?
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
good question . i think i might have to think about it .
that 's too good . i can trace it if something goes wrong .
good question . i have to think about it .
what ? you 're going to do but it is a real <unk> .
well you know you do have to smoke a lot of water .
i agree . i have a lot of work in this city . my friend is very beautiful .
oh i have a own life not a pet . i do n't want a big house in a hurry .
i think this is a very nice trip .
in other parts of the world especially in africa there is a problem with desertification . climate change and overfarming are causing farmland to turn into desert . in means that people cannot grow e
i do n't think so . in fact i quite like it very much .
hello . i 'm the dance of beauty . but i do n't like the jade bracelets .
well the sale price is 1 each .
you can always buy one yourself . it is not that expensive .
i know i but i bought her a flat now . it 's quite beautiful .
can you tell me how to do it ?
please tell me about it .
oh that 's a great idea . he will help you with that .
good question . i think it 's too early to discuss your question .
ok well i 'll take two small ones and a pair of shoes .
well i guess so .
oh my god . i know you 're a real fan too .
not anymore . ellie was playing games all day yesterday .
great ! it 's not that simple .
what are the peeler ?
i do n't know . do you want to play poker ?
good question . i have to think about it .
it 's not the same as we did . then each one has to stop clock and go to the stupid game .
it 's worth a shot .
hi rock sam ! hey i am surprised to see you again .
actually i 'm still a bit fed up .
i just need to ask you some questions .
just a regular home and eggs .
i think you will enjoy the qualifications and qualifications . how do you feel about your current work ?
i guess i 'll have a try .
and what 's your new title !
how did your boss get along with ?
if he 's better !
maybe . but i should have a try .
not bad . we have n't been feeling too well .
yeah a lot of people were here in your country so i went to the us .
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
i did n't know you had a brother .
i did n't know you were a brother .
no . we did n't even know that they had a fight .
in my opinion there is a lot of fat .
for me i think they are always on the same day . for me i always feel disappointed with my parents .
do you mean they have the same family ?
yes i like him .
i ca n't agree with you on that . but this is a really bad match .
yes a lot of family members are doing .
who would you like ?
hmm . . . well i guess i could give you some more advice .
i bought it yesterday .
well you mean that it 's very nice of you to say so . i do n't think you 'd better take your hair very well .
yeah . she is a teacher of her teacher .
come on . tell me what she needs .
but i do n't think i can have a boyfriend .
oh come on you do n't love that kind of <unk> . that means you are really conservative .
ok . keep it in mind . i 'd better not put my hands on my own .
you 're really going to be a great fit !
oh fine . if i have a good rest i 'll go to the beach this weekend .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
sounds good . tell me what else she will be .
would you like to have a look at the menu ?
yes it does .
let 's see . if we have it it it it it should be over there .
i 'm not really sure . i like looking at it but i usually do n't buy anything and can cook . sometimes i want to winter clothes if the post is good and i can cook it online .
yeah . i never heard of it but i 'm not keen on talking to my personal internet and i have to do the internet at our keen on buying all over the internet . if you want to be careful i do n't have to shop and i 'm going to be able to buy a new product that offers higher website .
i want to know more about the world 's life .
that 's fine .
very good . i like to chat with the american friends .
oh no way . a three people would n't be able to play table any time .
it 's almost all your fault . if you want to use the computer and i will also want to be looked at the same time .
it seems that it can get the right clothes i 'm going to work by that company .
it is around <unk> . i did n't realize the time .
may i have your name please ?
i had a cold .
it 's too bad . i have a flashlight in my closet .
it 's a job at a recruitment agency .
yes we have an offer with us and our company is on the internet . and my parents will love it .
yes i am . i ca n't afford a new apartment .
when is the first problem ?
i 'm not into the mall but i think it 's too expensive !
well you can t get up the subway ! i ve had a lot of homework and you can only take a few minutes .
thanks for everything . bye .
i like playing chess .
what 's in your spare time ?
i could n't agree with you more . you know you want to get a movie so that i can see all of them in the mind .
yeah i like all sorts of movies .
it 's a good movie . i was in the mood at the tv station first .
do n't you think it 's too bloody ?
yes they are different .
so what 's the difference between a man and a manager ?
i go to bed when i can only go there .
i 'm really looking forward to watching your own movie .
it 's the held place on central park .
well that 's a bit stiff . what is your favorite size ?
sure . it is a most popular dish .
i heard about it but sometimes when i get a new year 's eve .
sure . you can need to use a computer or the internet .
is it a horror movie ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
hey how would you like to taste my fist ?
alright all joking aside what kinds of moves do you like ?
um let me see romance comedy . documentary action science fiction animated and so on .
that is to say you like all <unk> except for horror movies .
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
the notebook is this type of movie .
i really do n't like it .
well then i could n't have done it without the company that we become one of the most famous .
ok . i ca n't wait to see it . let 's go !
i had a drop too much last night . i attended a banquet given by a chinese colleague of mine . and it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a chinese table .
you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or wouldbe friends is a way of solidifying friendship especially in northern china .
i just felt embarrassed if i refused to drink when people toasted to me . but if i keep gulping down one cup after another i 'm afraid i would feel unfit or sick .
you lose face by refusing to drink and the host might think you refuse to give him face . the right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . this will endear you to your friends .
a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night crying hoarsely and <unk> whole heaps of nonsense that i never understood .
then he must be opening his heart to the friends . in a word as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort no one will <unk> at you .
i got you . next time . i 'll <unk> a toast with a statement like i ca n't drink any more and then drink anyway .
really ? where did you hear that ?
i met with the supervisor just this morning . i do n't know but i am a little worried . who do you think will get sacked ?
i 'm not sure . . . well first it could n't be george . he is such a <unk> . he 'd wash the boss 's dog if he asked .
no it 's not going to be george . i do n't think it 's andy either . he is involved with the boss 's sister inlaw . and you know how whipped our boss is .
that 's true . what about lisa ? i bet there 's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
lisa ? no way . i 've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . you know rumors ca n't come out from nowhere .
well okay . then there is still michael . but he 's the boss pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . it 's the boss 's .
no that would be crazy . but then who will it be ? i 'll have to write a check .
well it could be me too . but i am not too worried . this place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hardass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . it would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place .
it 's very nice . i have n't heard live music in a while . this is fun .
well then may i invite you for the next dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
do n't worry . i 'm not much of a dancer myself .
you 're dancing so well .
you dance beautifully too .
when did you learn to dance ?
in college . but i do n't dance very often . what 's your favourite dance ?
it 's hard to say . it depends . but i love the waltz .
how about tango ?
oh i like it . it 's such a beautiful dance but i ca n't do it well . what about you ?
tango is my favorite . anything but <unk> or the foxtrot . the music has stopped
thank you for the dance .
would you like to dance dance with me ?
thanks . no . i 'll have to have another drink .
yes it 's not like what the radio said at all .
ok . would you like to have a look at the menu ?
i did n't go to see a doctor . it 's about five degrees centigrade .
is it possible to change the room ?
i 'm afraid we will stay at the beach .
that 's really convenient . will the medical plan cover on today ?
it really is . no wonder how long she did ?
in my opinion you are not feeling well . it will be fine if you are gonna come to work .
we are going to stay here .
oh nice . so nice !
i am better . what about you ?
i think we should take the two weeks .
it seems that english have been half an hour and in the united states .
because i felt ok .
and the fire ?
he had a truck checked over the freeway .
that 's right . thanks for the smell .
yes i was . as you know i liked my car !
oh great ! so how do you work here ?
i terribly sorry about that . i did n't know when i got a job and the manager asked me to look at it .
it 's really good .
i 've been with the work . but even if you 're hired . how did you feel about it ?
wow this is true .
because i have no idea what to do .
what 's the usual guy on him ?
yes but you know i am used to learn it .
you should have been able to read the book first .
he has a man who is familiar with his clothes .
what about a blouse ?
i couldn t have felt better .
i think so . i saw the man who said it was better .
yes it 's possible .
what is your impression that you are on the one that you may be doing ?
i 'm sorry . i 'll try my best .
what dress is you 'd like ?
what ? do you think it 's wrong ?
well you have to attend a job that 's behind . do you have any questions ?
i can t get you something for you . i am so bored and you can t get him something for you .
sure . a ufo is just a space vehicle from another planet . if you think about it our space <unk> are ufos .
i 've never thought about it like that before .
i 've seen photos of ufos in america before but they 've all looked doctored up .
do you think that there 's life on other planets ?
i think there must be .
yes . we should have more time .
i was sick .
do you think that there 's intelligent life trying to contact us ?
no but we 're trying to contact them .
i suppose you 're right .
i think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet <unk> will not become extinct .
do you really think that global warming wil destroy earth some day ?
there 's a lot of evidence that suggest it will but i do n't think it 's going to happen any time soon .
you 're in luck . we have that meeting .
france ? is it your teacher ?
it s all right . who are you going to cook ?
oh . that 's all right . i just need your help .
ok just take it easy . anything else you say is best for you ?
i m worried . there s nothing wrong .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
i guess someday . i 'm too busy to stop smoking and stop by not as good as possible .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
let me see . that one goes for 17 .
would you take 12 ?
no i can t give it to you let you have it for 12 . how about 14 ?
13 . 50 ?
sorry 14 is the lowest i can go .
i know what you mean .
are you doing anything tonight ?
the <unk> s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . we re losing again .
really ? then i guess i won t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
actually you might because there s a big convention in town this weekend .
i m not too worried about it . i always seem to find something .
let me check . oh ! it s at 325 .
wow that 's cutting it close ! that means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! what gate is it at ?
it 's at . . . gate 14 .
oh great ! that s at the other end of the terminal !
ok so here 's the plan when we land run to gate 14 !
i 'm be right behind ya !
i have my own company that designs computer systems .
you know what ? i think you should pick up your prescription first .
it s a very cool job .
oh what a lucky man ! i mean .
i work at the polling place .
yes we do .
i am sorry but i do n't know the busy one . i always go to the library .
may i help you with something ?
read me the index number !
my grandmother used to play that way .
maybe you should ask about it sometime .
because you can see the stars perfectly .
well in the meantime do you ever get lonely living alone ?
i do n't think so . i 'm very disappointed .
yes it 's a very case of my marriage .
i was robbed .
i know . i think you 're kidding .
i was married for three years .
yes but in many countries they get along with them as well .
i 'd better not .
i see . you have married a wife and a great husband .
i 'm telling you the truth .
really ? you are so sorry about that .
i have been married for three years .
and how many staff do you employ ?
have you heard about him ?
i ll do . you know what the problem was .
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
i have a large family . i have three older sisters my twin sister a younger brother and parents .
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
we re identical . i mean we look exactly the same but we are complete opposites when it comes to everything else .
interesting . it must be great having a twin sister . are you best friends too ?
we used to be really close but that all changed once she moved to shanghai . how about your family ? you didn t mention to your biological father .
i don t know much about him . he died when i was just a baby . even though i don t have a blood relationship with my stepfather and stepbrother i consider them to be my real family .
what about your stepbrother 's mother ?
no she also died when my stepbrother was little . my mother and my mother died and shouting .
sounds like it was meant to be .
yeah i did . he ran it by me and everything was finally a record .
i know . it 's too hard to read .
oh my dear lady is my favorite .
it 's interesting . oh there is a large opera star and a few other mill on the floss . it describe there are childhood and disputes cause them to separate the book ends with them .
that must be a low family . my family must have been out for a long time .
a wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . if i had drunk enough and i would have had the bold to punch him in the face .
sure it will be a terrible thing to do .
well he has big blue eyes and long blonde hair .
thanks doctor . i will get a medical plan .
he 's a <unk> guy with a nice girl .
he has successful a man of his father now .
first we 'll discuss the details .
i was born in beijing but i spent most of my childhood in london .
oh we have to stay on american airline flight no . 12 at london .
i had a pretty strict upbringing and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me .
what do they mean ?
no they 're always talking big .
what is the difference between these two ?
my parents wanted me to stay in beijing but i decided to go back to england . i graduated from university of newcastle upon tyne with a degree in cross culture communication .
wow that sounds like a very good decision . what was your graduation thesis on ?
i am a journalist . i write for china daily .
there s a lot of universities with that many students in the book .
no way i missed it .
i see . what other languages do you like ?
you seemed to be my professional . i could n't help it .
ok . do you know anything about the author 's life ?
i 'm sorry . i 'm going to ask you a few questions .
i also think the most countries in your country country country countries use cruel .
my husband and i have thought about it but we ve decided not to have any . they are just too expensive . besides with all the news about global warming on the news lately who knows what kind of world we ll have in the future . what about you ?
well what have you thought about the families ?
for me growing up in a big family always made me <unk> for attention . i always wanted to be an only child so that i could always do what i wanted and so that i wouldn t ever have to share .
but what do you think about people who have to keep fit ?
yes i know . you 're right . i 've heard that the place is better than 20 years old .
do you think many people in china now ?
that 's true . but as a woman i m glad that even though i don t want any children i at least have a choice in the respect .
i know what you mean . but is one of the other child ?
i don t know what other people think but i for one envy only children !
that sounds great . i 'm absolutely starving ! what kind of food are you in the mood for ?
i 'd love something spicy . maybe we could get some sichuan hotpot .
you are a woman after my own heart . i do n't know many people who can handle spicy food . are you sure you are up for hot pot ?
you are right . i have been so angry at work so hard . i did n't know many people at work . they are very kind . i should follow you and you would n't have been able to pick me up at work .
you are so kind . thank you for helping me .
well let 's stop dragging our feet and find a sichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner !
let me think about it for a minute . let 's see . . . oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! give me a second and it 'll come to me .
well . . . ? have you thought of it yet ?
no . . .
what about his hair ?
that 's it ! that s the one i was thinking of ! i told you i 'd remember it !
you really have a big head do n't you ?
i m not sure but probably about 75 years . how about in your country ?
about 70 i think . this newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . it 's a problem that will soon affect most of the world .
i heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .
perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
did she ? that s great . however if we have too many children that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .
that 's true . it 's important to have the learned that we 'll have to increase it to your mother .
oh he 's out of luck .
he ll be a teenager before you do that !
i had mine when i was 24 . that 's a little young . i d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .
yes i think you re right . i m thinking about having a child but not just yet .
oh is n't there anyone else in the neighborhood ?
yes there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out have fun and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discourage them but they don t often succeed .
parents usually give their children more freedom in a different world .
it s almost impossible to get the right balance . if you are too strict kids might ignore you . if you are too lenient they might go wild .
what did you argue about ?
he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back . he said he didn t have the money yet .
well he should pay you back . it s only fair .
yes but i got angry with him too quickly . he probably thought that i <unk> him . i shouldn t have got angry .
did you lend him a lot of money ?
not much . i had to pay an unexpected bill so i needed the money back .
well talk to him about it next time you see him . he probably feels as bad about it as you do . close friends sometimes have disagreements . it s nothing unusual . neither of you said anything really nasty did you ?
no we re right . i guess you re right . we should patch things up .
of course you should . you wouldn t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship would you ?
i m not sure . i guess i d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time .
do you think people like that ?
i agree . you are not going to a problem in a single person .
maybe you but i don t think it s challenging enough for me to buy a new one .
you mean at home ?
you re people who just got dressed .
i know what you mean . i m really worried about . that s why i bought this outfit .
you are right . thank you for the advice .
oh it 's the same as we . anyway i think we have to make a lot of different friends .
i just make eye contact with him and nod my head . then i tell him when he comes over to the table . why do you ask ?
i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
that seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .
that s what i thought . i just thought i d ask you and see what you thought of it . anyway what did you do yesterday evening ?
well it was a warm evening so i stretched my legs . i walked along the canal for a couple of miles . actually several other people had the same idea . i saw bill .
did you ? how is he these days ?
he seemed ok . we didn t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . we just waved at each other .
i need to move some furniture . could you help me to lift it ?
of course . what do you want to move first ?
let s move the sofa . can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? i ll lift this end . i want to move it sideways in that direction .
no not very much . he s too ambitious and dishonest .
i like his brother . i is not alike .
yes . they are completely different . paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother .
what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?
i think i m polite careful relaxed and shy .
oh i do n't think you 're shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party .
well . yes but those people always start talking to me . i never talk to them first . perhaps i 'm not as shy as i think . anyway you 're certainly not shy !
you 're right . i love going out and making new friends .
so you 'll be at my birthday party on friday ?
i 'll be there .
i wouldn t miss it for the world ! it s sure to be fun . she s invited a lot of people . do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ?
if everyone turned up it would be a squeeze but a few people said that they couldn t go so i think it should be ok ?
are you taking anything ?
i ve got her a birthday present and i ll take a bottle fo wine too .
that s a good idea . she told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . i think it s going to be a noisy party . i hope her neighbours don t mind too much .
helen gets on very well with her neighbours . i wouldn t be surprised if they went to the party too .
i hope it s time for everyone to get a new party . this party is going to have a dog .
well don t be late . i ll see you on friday at helen s .
it certainly was a great party . it s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here .
i expected that something might get broken . that doesn t bother me . that spilled drink won t leave a stain will it ?
i doubt it i 'll deal with it right away . luckily it wasn t a glass of red wine i ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth .
i m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag .
afterwards we can do the washing up together . everything will be finished within an hour . your friend keith is really funny . i liked his magic tricks .
yes he s very good . . isn t he ? he told some funny stories too .
amanda told some very funny jokes . at the beginning of the party she was being very serious .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
what did you put in that punch ? it tasted great but was quite strong .
that s my little secret . did you like the snacks that i prepared ?
very much . the birthday cake was delicious wasn t it ? emily told me that she and karen made it themselves .
that cake tasted so good ! it disappeared within minutes so i think everyone liked it a lot . how s that stain ?
all cleaned up . are you ready to start the washing up ?
well first of all it s much bigger . it has the same number of rooms but each room is larger . we also have a larger garden which our dog loves of course !
so it s a threebedrooms detached house ?
yes . one bedroom is for my wife and i . there s another for our daughter . my wife wants to use the third one as a guest room but i d like to make it into a study . our daughter is also keen on making it a study so that s probably what will happen .
what s the kitchen like ? the kitchen god a great stereo . .
that s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . the kitchen and dining room are together . it s really large .
are the rooms nice and bright ?
yes they are . that s very important to us . we like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . each room has large windows .
do you have a balcony ?
no we don t . we wish we had one . that s the only thing we wanted but don t have . the area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly .
you re right on the edge of the city aren t you ? there can t be much noise or traffic there . is it easy to get into city centre ?
it s a very quiet neighbourhood . there s some traffic but not much . it s not very difficult to get to the city centre but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ll get lost . so when are you going to drop by ?
my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . they have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . the picture are of things they want . people sign their name by the item they want .
that s clever ! then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there s no chance of two people buying the same gift . what things were in the notebook ?
most of the things were household appliance . you know everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . i think it s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home .
so what did you get them ?
i bought a sewing machine . i know that my friend likes making her own clothes but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems .
that sounds kind of boring . oh look . i think we should get out of the tree . the <unk> are really cute .
i believe it was declined .
household appliance don t seem to last for a long time nowadays .
i think it s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . because they know that we will buy the new models the appliances don t need to last more than five or ten years at most .
not really . i like looking on the internet at what s available but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i m buying before i pay for it . sometimes i ll look at something in a shop but later buy it online if it s cheaper . you don t like buying things online do you ?
that s an excellent idea . you never who s trying to find out your codes and <unk> . i think you can find the local internet for a visit .
not really . i know that it s ok . but if you buy from <unk> companies with secure websites you should be ok . even though i use online shopping facilities i don t think it s the best way to shop .
i m surprised to hear you say that . i thought you loved anything technological .
i do . i m a big fan of using new technology but i don t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . i think people need to get out and interact with other people .
so how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
sure . i d love to join you . can we stop by the computer store ? i just want to see if they have something .
sure . while you re in the computer store . i will visit the book store opposite . i like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting .
ok . i ve finished online . let s go . i ll just get some money and my credit card .
thanks for reminding me . i had forgotten to get mine .
i 've got it .
i 'll bet she 's going to be around with you .
yes . it s really nice talking to you .

i 'm sorry sir . the flight is full now .
can you tell me how to use the machines ?
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
that s ok .
you re welcome . see you later .
no that way is longer . there are more stop lights on that street .
i am glad that you like the house . we can provide more than a small quantity .
no . we do n't use them .
i think it s good to have a try . what are you going to do ?
it s pretty large .
that s usual nowadays . you don t know how that food won t be ?
no i did n't think of that . i started three weeks ago . the weather report said the same thing is that i had no problem .
well . you just take the in touch with the design of the company .
not at all . actually you had n't been a little too much trouble .
really ? i m glad to hear that . you ve been in america for two weeks .
that 's right . i 'm glad you enjoyed it .
that s a good idea . i d love that .
will we have the same restaurant on the express bus ?
how long is it altogether ?
it s about six or seven miles . that s about the kilometers .
that sounds ok . so we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall .
right . then we turn left and walk up this small hill . the view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . we can eat a snack there .
then we will follow this path down the hill to the old church .
we can spend a few minutes looking around the church . then we turn right and walk along this path .
this path leads to the cave . can we look inside the cave ?
yes we can but it isn t very interesting .
then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path .
this path leads to the cave . can we look inside the cave ?
would you like to have dinner with me ?
i think it will take about four hours including breaks .
that s fine . are there signposts along the way in case we get lost ?
yes there are . they tell use which way to go and how far we have to walk .
yes . i ve been to the states for two years .
that s fine . well you d better prepare our application materials for the interview . then i m sure you ll be the more qualified candidate .
i m so sorry . i must ask you my john .
how ay years have you been working with him ?
i had to get them ready for the next few weeks .
yes one customerone file is essential . and he application through a student .
i 've been informed that there are many opportunities to do in this town . in any case i never know whether or not i can have the opportunity to work with .
i ll get them .
do n't you think of it ?
hi . i 'd like to open a new account please .
a double room ?
you see we are tourists whose requests are different so please tell me more about it will you ?
yes i 'm very sorry . we have no reservation at the moment .
susan pete and i will bring you my coat and we will also need to look for it .
well . can i pay by card ?
that 's fine . thank you very much .
no problem . bye .
yes here you are . do i need to sign my name here ?
sure . here it is .
apparently you have unpaid late fees .
yes i d like to check three pieces .
i m sorry sir . airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage at twenty kilograms each plus one piece of carryon luggage . i will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase .
what ? why ! i am taking an intercontinental flight ! i m flying sixteen thousand cms ! how am i supposed to only take two twenty kilo bags ? that s absurd !
i am sorry sir there s nothing i can do . you cannot board the flight with that large bag either . carry on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat . that bag is clearly too big .
now i see . you charge next to nothing for an international ticket but when it comes to charging for any other small thing you charge an arm and a leg ! so tell me miss how much will i have to pay for all of this .
let s see . . . six hundred and twentyfive us dollars .
that s more than my roundtrip ticket !
i 'm afraid we do n't . we have to slow down .
that 's right . we 'll be late .
yes it is . are you in a hurry sir ?
i am leaving on august for august 15 .
well i could have a few friends that are free to do you go ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
you should have stayed there for a few days and see how your christmas is .
yes i am going to have it on and i do n't mind .
it s very nice and cheap .
how much do you charge ?
john .
can you tell me something about it ?
it should be ready by the end of the world .
thanks mom . let s get the time . that will be our first class !
sir you were charged for watching titanic monday night .
well the wrong information is in my file . i was at a great concert that night .
oh yes that 's right . your flight was really booked with us .
you are a little bit crazy .
i 've come a lot of things today . i hope you can come again soon .
you ca n't do that ! you ca n't charge me for a mistake that you made !
i 'll just have to cancel your account right ?
that s all right . i will be working late . is everything ok ?
no i did n't get too bad . i really want to talk to you about the food i leave .
it tastes good .
first we want 150 pounds of chicken and chicken .
the problem is that you might want to get the flu .
that 's great . i 've already made a master 's degree in hr management .
not . i will be sure .
great ! i like to go there with you ! in a few minutes i 'll be back to her house .
i can tell you that i 'm afraid there is still no single room available for three months .
you should try the <unk> restaurant .
at 8 o 'clock .
you think the music is supposed to be warm inside the door . it would be ok to take the taste .
you have n't had a good idea .
i have n't decided yet . maybe i 'll find a parttime job in the future .
i like that ! could you please call them to see if we have a table ?
ok what time would you like the reservation for ?
what would you like to order ?
is it possible to get a beer ?
i 'm sorry . we 're currently out of filet mignon . may i suggest the porterhouse instead ?
i 'd prefer the filet but the porterhouse will do .
thanks . i could smell you in chocolatecovered strawberries with the champagne ?
normally i would take you up on that suggestion but just the champagne will be fine for tonight .
thank you for your order .
that 's fine thank you very much .
ok i will take it .
just plug the ethernet cable into your computer and a prompt will tell you the payment options .
that would be okay . but i have an ethernet port . my laptop uses wireless only .
in that case i need to run some alternatives .
please bring me a chocolate <unk> 's over there .
first of all can i know your name ?
great ! how much do i charge ?
with the fifty yuan a week but smoking is not allowed .
that 's fine . i 'll take the other alternatives .
just bring your laptop down here .
great ! what if i need to print something in the lobby ?
sure . but you have to pay in extra charge for it .
certainly . what would you like to drink ?
is n't it ?
i 'm sorry . we have no more filet mignon . may i suggest the porterhouse instead ?
i 'd prefer the filet but porterhouse will do .
perhaps i could interest you in chocolatecovered strawberries with the champagne ?
just the champagne will be fine thank you .
ok let 's go see a movie .
yes . it 'll be right back .
i might need some tools though . do you know where i can get some ?
ok and what kind of meat do you want ?
ok . please give me the style in this picture .
i hate to tell you this but we have no more filet mignon . may i suggest the porterhouse instead ?
hmm i prefer filet but porterhouse will do .
and i could also prefer chocolatecovered strawberries with the champagne ?
just the champagne will be fine thank you .
but we still have some problems .
thank you very much .
i like what i see .
just plug the ethernet cable into your computer and a prompt will tell you the payment options .
that would be okay . i see the cable . but my computer runs on wireless only .
in that case you just need to turn the ethernet port .

is there a charge ?
it 's 150 rib for the service .
great . now do you have a copy of the hours ?

great ! what about the free membership ?

i am sure it 's broken .

well yes that 's right . thank you .
i want to tell you that there is a no room for the next one .
i see . is there anything else i can do for you ?

yes i am . but i have to pay the bill and i d better not have to pay for cash .

so america should be <unk> in america . should i pay duty on it ?
it s the kind of thing we have learned more about our company .

i 'm an export manager in <unk> .
yes it does .
sure . i 'd like to . what kind of products do you think ?
but some of the work is better than the others .

i 'm not sure we 'll agree with you .
i am very sorry . but i have n't got any certificate of the secondary research .

i have to deposit a minimum amount .
you 'll be staying in a minute .
i 'll be sure to get that out of a few minutes .
how much would i pay ?
that 's okay . i 'll just have that right now .
i think the government needs to be more favorable . the government would also want a lot of turmoil in the markets . the main global warming destroys this place is about <unk> .

i do n't think so . that 's why i was flat high .
that 's great . i 'll try that little more could be a little more sensitive to the city in a little while .
several .

they look like a guy .
i would n't say that . it 's really boring .
what about her soup ?
she 's a typical sagittarius boy . i mean she 's not a cheater .
as a matter of fact he is a indeed in a taxi . he can see that as a member of the suspect .

it 's half past seven .
what a lot of people have to prepare for the presentation ?
yes i do . i d prefer you didn t . the ac airconditioning is also on .
i do n't know . i just want to be independent .
some of the designers are not very interested in it .
i m a doctor .
sounds like a good idea . he always wears very much information about this . i think that s a very good idea . how about your job ?
to be honest i suppose my first promotion is an excellent choice .
if you are hired when you can get the position you are going to work .
she 'd say i have a lot of initiative i see the big picture and i do what has to be done . second i always meet deadlines . if i say i 'm going to do it . lastly i have the ability to focus on what i 'm working on i am not easily distracted .
would you like to work in the finance department ?

i 'm working in teams .
how do you develop good relationships in your work ?
no i did n't know anything about it .
is she as old as you ?
well i m very good at both written and i m very good at both discourse to keep it straight and strategic competence .
sometimes that 's what i 've been looking for .
i never seem to have a choice but i do n't know what they 're doing .
how about your work environment ?
well a working relationship . i think a company is a place to get work done . certainly friendly open relationships among all company employees is important . but i think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a working relationship with the boss .
a company is a place to get work done . you 'll have a definite answer from us .
i 'll do my best .
actually that makes us feel better .
that 's all right . i work overtime at my previous job and i 'm very busy .
congratulations ! but do you find out what you need to do next ?
i think my husband is the most important thing . i can t find a job in the job .
why do n't you just give this a chance to start ?
i 'm quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
right . all right . come on . what do you have in mind ?
i think that i 'm a new engine which would be a threat to those of us that have stars .
that 's the last time i think i know you 're wild .
well i m very good with people . i m honorable . i work hard . i work well under pressure . and i m patient .
do you consider other responsibilities ?
i m afraid i m a poor talker . i m not comfortable talking with the people whom i have just met for the first time . that is not very good for business so i have been studying public speaking .
oh it is my cell phone ringing . i set it in the vibration mode .
it is a good habit to set your cell phone to <unk> . it is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices .
you are right . some ring tone is just terribly loud . you can hear it even in the next door . it is really a kind of distraction .
maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done .
there is no doubt that .
of course you can . i am sure this one works very well . i just sent dozens of pages . how many pages are you sending ? are you familiar with my fax machine ?
yes i think you have the same model as i have . does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
yes it will print immediately .
it seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
do you know how to do it ? i am not so good at machine things . i will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
check with somebody from the it department . they are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
we have thought of you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience .
experience is indeed very important but don t you think capability is more important than it ?
how can you prove to me that you are not interested in ?
maybe you could hire me on trial if i m not qualified for this position you can let me go .
ok . thank you very much .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
well open the door to mouth . would you mind waiting a moment please ?
no i do n't think i have any spare time to listen . you know how to use a computer .
that 's why i should do this .
then what should i do ?
i am not going to be able to vote this tuesday .
ok ok . if you do n't know how to handle a job that will be worse .
congratulations . what am you responsible for ?
if you change your mind let me know .
i will good luck .
yes . is that all right ?
i want to know whether you will come to the interview . so have you accepted offers from other companies ?
oh . i 'm sorry but i just accepted another offer which i feel is better suited to my needs .
well i think that the same thing is all that you would like to do .
so you have to open all the envelopes .
yes except the personal mail . and i also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the email box regularly .
do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
yes and i check all the emails for mr . thomas .
but is that why ?
i 'll be here to pick you up at 630 .
that 's fine with me .
it 's my pleasure . well then see you tomorrow .
goodbye and have a good day .
it 's thursday i think .
this is used to be wonderful .
it 's january .
what specific places do you wish to visit ?
ok . come in please .
at eight o 'clock tomorrow evening .
we will meet you at 7
what do you normally eat ?
you wo n't be late . it 's still early .
really ? how long does it take ?
how did you know ?
well i guess so . i 've lost it .
no really . i can only hear a little accent .
our company is fairly new . i 've worked in the production field for several years .
would you like something to drink with all the people in your family ?
i 'm the same as i expected . but i 'll be able to accept the job .
good morning mr . li .
it 's 11 o 'clock .
ten minutes please . i 'm afraid we 're fully booked in the morning .
it 's time to go back to sleep .
no i could n't make it . i was late . and i could n't make it .
how long have you been on the bus ?
i really want to get a home that is n't leaving .
ok please rest a little bit .
i 've been feeling a little lightheaded lately .
so would you like me to go with you ?
you can also list your name address and phone number in the mail of the person you need to know . if you need to provide your name of the person you can get information from the university you can be asked for .
that sounds wonderful . the full name of the company and all of your information are sent out to the email address of each .
you should take them with the local specialty .
pretty good . the dog is spectacular . we have a lot of special on the streets in the east .
where is that ?
that 's too bad . i will send someone to tell you .
let me see . everything looks fine .
ok . here is the copy form for you .
i think the letter of inquiry should be written briefly . if it 's too long i 'm afraid the employer wo n't have time to read it .
is it convenient for you to help me ?
yes . is this <unk> of sales ?
that 's not bad . how long have you been in pr ?
yes this is is of course . we can enjoy our beauty in difference .
that 's great . congratulations .
yes of course . there are many things we can do .
but we have a lot of common <unk> in our company so we do n't have much work to deal with .
yes mr . wang . i 've booked two minutes ago .
and how many people will be there ?
yes i can have it ready by friday .
what 's the rent at ?
it 's the second floor . i can wait to see what the name is .
well it is a very difficult language to learn . i think you 'll be a very good employer .
i 'll have the separate ways .
yes thanks . good morning mr . smith .
ok . i need to sign one for that .
are you having a meeting with your products ?
what 's the exact time you see ?
well . no problem .
i 've heard that the packing is very advanced for this product . i 'd like to go ahead .
i think we are very interested in the olympic games . i think our biggest agency has to deal with the problem and we can do more business on the same basis .
the european market is not familiar with your products . you have competitors from japan and other continental countries . at the beginning of our campaign there is sales resistance to overcome we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news papers and tv programs . a 20 commission will not leave us much .
yes i think they are . we can make sure that the child is right .
what 's playing at the century fox ?
as a rule we do n't allow any commission . however as you know we have a good deal . it 's the exact amount of our quantity you wish to have in mind .
you may have known that we have competitors from south korea and other countries . at the beginning of our campaign there is sales resistance to overcome we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news papers and tv programs . a 10 commission will not leave us much .
i would really hate to tell you that .
since you can give me a small order we 'll accept the agency agreement .
yep . that way i can satisfy my craving for spicy food and you can eat hot pot without burning into flames .
we will pay by installments of the commission and the total amount is 1000 .
i want to pay in the traveler s check .
fine we 'll let you know when we get down to the bottom of your order .
is it true ? we always keep in touch with you .
we have all of you in this office . would you like to join us ?
i also like to learn a lot from you .
it certainly was ! so what are you going to do with your windfall ?
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ve actually been abroad before .
well . welcome to my office .
good . i was thinking that i d like to invite you to watch a movie . i can meet you at the cinema gate .
fine . let 's go over it .
good gracious ! so are we covered ?
i can understand . we ll have them there as soon as possible .
i see . i think that you would have to take more pictures .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
i could but that 's true .
well i think we are covered by that . so far we will get the contract soon .
i think the inspection bureau at your end when effecting inspection only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard . the part that was not dried properly most probably escaped their attention . as the amount in question is only 20 of the whole shipment i think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss .
very good . shall we go to a chinese restaurant ?
ok . i 'll show it to you .
would it be a lot easier if you d like me to come back in a few days ?
let me see . laptop flash disk a ballpoint pen a pencil a notebook a pair of glasses cell phone charger moisture notion . . . oh that is too much . you are not going to a business trip .
i guess i need all of them .
actually the company will provide you with all of these supplies . so you can leave this very thick notebook at home .
i know . but it is my lucky charm . i carry it all the time .
suit yourself . don t forget to set the alarm clock .
yes i think that i am quite good at working with people .
do you have more friends that are more independent than a man ?
i think this is the only reason that i am good at making the long meet .
what is your size ?
well i would like to look at the restroom . can you come in at me ?
good . now just bring me the bill and i 'll think we 'll have to look at it .
where did you go wrong ?
no i 'm expected to be employed by the company .
tell me how she 's been .
thank you for saying so . but i am happy to know the position of manager .
oh i am very pleased you know that 's my favorite job .
i can give you a few more minutes at the time .
okay . well i 'll send you a maid to pick up your order .
it could be that time .
i 've finished the first draft but the professor said it 's poorly written . i have to <unk> it . it 's so depressing .
the second one told me that the job information was released half a year ago and had been overdue .
how about some employee contract on the website ?
can you tell me how much the new year will take last ?
you are very kind to say so . thank you .
i 'm sure you will .
thanks . please send the email to me with the necessary paperwork .
thank you very much for your advice .
then we 'll have to go back to get one for lunch and you 'll have to come back here then .
yes of course . we 've also heard a lot of both kinds of experience and conditions are essential .
i 'm fine . i am going swimming this afternoon . are you coming with me ?
well to be honest i have no choice . we can provide you a loan or loan .
i am but i have to go over the books with you before i make up my mind .
sure no problem .
sure it 's fine .
thanks . that 's very nice of you .
in addition they are waterproof and shockproof .
you know in china we will provide you a speedy interview if you don t mind me .
yes my father 's favorite .
what do you think of the blood pressure ?
i was . it was just that the holidays are coming up and i won t be able to home because i can t afford the airfare . i m just longing for some of the comforts of home like my family .
good . keep your good work .
i 'm not sure . we also have l c
what kind of work would you like ?
no . now i have an idea .
yes speaking . what can i do for you ?
i am the hr manager of the abc company . you are on the list of interviewees . would you please come over to have an interview ?
ok please hold me . i am very sorry to hear that .
the personnel department is on the second floor . don t you know where the meeting is ?
yes speaking . what can i do for you ?
i am calling to let you know that you are expected to come for an interview in our branch .
ok a minute . i can leave you a message . thank you for calling .
sure . go on this road and turn left .
i 'm sorry mr . baker is not in . may i take a message ?
but could you tell me when he will be back ?
tell him to call me tomorrow morning .
this is mrs . wang from jane coper .
i have been employed as a secretary for a senior executive secretary with a company .
this is our first time to have a good present .
yes . i am already responsible for all of the work .
oh . . . i 'm glad to hear that .
well . all right . we 'll meet you at 3 . 00 this afternoon and i 'll come back soon .
by the end of the month .
thanks . well everything is fine .
i have just left school but i am well acquainted with office work .
what qualities would you expect of persons working as a team ?
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
i see . maybe you can do it .
i 'll tell you the english is very good .
i see . he 'll send you a cv or accountant .
i appreciate it .
yes but we ca n't do it well . if we were really worried we would have to wait for the next two weeks .
you are right . but i 've seen that movie . it 's in the right company .
how about you ? have you got any plans ?
all right . i was quite interested in the student field and how to begin the sales manager .
i know i always likes to read romance music very much .
thanks . i do like football matches .
they 're glad that he 's gone to the hospital .
well . wait a minute . i know he is a very fast student and i am sure he will write a note .
you should take a look at all the companies choose from the ones you need to see . some people are listening to the web sites as well . if you want to see the picture of the interviewer .
sure i know that but it is very difficult to write a chance to get the job done .
i m not good at speaking in public . i feel uncomfortable when i speak in public .
i do n't know many people like that .
that s all . how much altogether ?
well i love it . the room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . there are plants along the corridor . especially i got my own desk with computer and telephone . such a great place !
that s very good . i once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
what was so bad about it ?
small rooms small window a small desk shared by three people . i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
sounds bad ! lucky you ! you didn t take that job . i think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
totally agree . by the way the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . you can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
how do you want your egg cooked ?
good morning .
it s on the fourth floor . may i have the number ?
yes i am wondering if i could arrange a table for two please .
oh thank you . then you can keep an eye with us .
thank you but i will do my best .
any time . we 'll pack it up later .
will that be first class or economy seat ?
starting salary is 150 a weekplus commissions of course .
that 's very nice of you . i 'll have to think about it .
ok see you then !
hello steven .
i really like to get you a little better .
yes it is quite reasonable .
i think we should have a house cleaning today . what 's your opinion ?
that 's a lot of fun .
quite a lot . they take them a lot .
i don t know why they re pretty expensive .
i m pretty happy living there .
but i do n't know how to pay and i can .
i 'll pick you up .
yes i do . right now i have an idea of the contract .
the average ten days will be ok .
when will you be able to deliver ?
can i give her a message for you ?
ok . just give me a deposit .
it is just too much . don t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ?
not at all ! i like the design so much . the designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept .
wow i doubt that .
i want to job in a restaurant .
congratulations ! you are a good accountant .
i would n't mind working in a management position .
i 'm here to see the manager .
we could try the best .
i have worked for this company for two years .
well you can pick up my resignation at one of the day .
let me know if i can do anything for you .

wonderful . then how many employers have you worked for ?
i am very familiar with windows operating system .

i 've been informed that there are many opportunities to get into the foreign company . first i want to have more chances to be something that can display my background and talents . you know something about your company .
great . i am very happy to be one of the customers . i think you can keep this new position .
thank you ma 'am . is it ok to get them from the office ?
sure no problem . see you then .
basically i ve got a few concerns about him and the bottom line is i don t think he s a good fit for our company .
ok . i 'll stay here for you tomorrow .
my stomach is n't mine .
i d like to know something exciting on the labor floor . we can do this weekend .
how about this one ? we have a lot of improvement in your products .
if you take a look at the samples you can see what they 're planning to do .
i have no idea what a great idea .
really ? have you ever been there ?
ok . you go bye .
i 'd like to stay there for three days .
we have one single room on the fifth floor .
on the 5th street .
yes i did .
can you imagine what he is like now ?
no i 'd like to tell you that the company is very interested in marketing . it 's a more convenient job than the company .
we have had better work on these days .
do you see the trend continuing over the next few months ?
we have a full set of price . you can take up with the shipping costs and the cost for a third .
no he is in the middle of the country .
i want to know whether you will come to the interview . so have you accepted offers from other companies ?

your starting salary is 150 a weekplus commissions of course .
do you feel much better when you change your job ?
do you have a medical plan ?
oh my understanding is not the company policy .
what are they all for ?
it s so small . what are the least expensive ?
of course . on the top mr . thomas the managing director is responsible for running the company .
i agree with you but what is more the price ?
we will give you a discount since we order the price of cpu .
but i ca n't agree with you .
you must be able to do the business at first ?
so you 're telling me then what will happen ?
i 'd like to see a few things about that i 've already given me on my mind .
well after i have 34 years of work i can still do some jogging in the summer .
yes thursday would be fine . what time shall i come ?
great . thank you very much .
i 've been looking forward to it . please give me a call and i 'll go there .

you 're right . and i 'll have to put it in the computer .
a man of mine is an american company .

you 'd better have a good rest for a week . be sure to have regular meals . stay away from alcohol . give up smoking at least a little while .
i agree . i m glad you could help me out .

this is brown speaking . i 'd like to speak to mr . tomas .
i am sorry he is not here at the moment .
well i wo n't keep him long .
i 'm afraid not . he is away for the rest of the day .
is there any way i can reach him ?
he is in the office at the moment . may i take a message ?
yes . can you tell him i want to call him back as soon as he can get back to him ?
would you like to make another appointment ?
unfortunately i 'm leaving here right now .
i see . i 'll tell mr . tomas you 've called .
when did you pass the interview ?
i 'm very sorry about this .
just a moment please . i 'll have to put you through .
may i know your name please ?
sorry but he 's not in . may i take a message for you ?
this is robert jordan . would you ask him to call me back please ?
ok i 'll tell him .
good morning . i have a reservation for a single room with a bath here .
yes please . i 'm the manager of the company .
no . as soon as possible .
i think he might . in a few minutes can be free until he comes back .
then would you hold on a moment ?
i 'm not sure . but i 'll get a table ready as fast as i can .
i 'll wait .
would you like to make it 1130 ?
that 's right . i have an appointment with mr . wang of abc company tomorrow morning .
what 's the name and the address ?
unfortunately i 'm leaving here unexpectedly and i may be away for several days .
very good . now that 's very important for me . i 'll be expecting you around two o 'clock .
mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
yes i am sorry . i missed the bus .
but there 's a bus every ten minutes and you are over 1 hour late .
well i missed several buses .
how on earth can you miss several buses ?
i ah . . . i got have late .
oh come on gordon it 's the afternoon now . why were you late really ?
well i . . . i lost my wallet and i . . .
have you got it now ?
yes i found it again .
i 'm glad you told me .
i was robbed this morning .
i am not convinced by your explanation .
this is brown speaking . i 'd like to speak to mr . tomas .
i am sorry he is not here at the moment .
well i wo n't keep him long .
i 'm afraid not . he is away for the rest of the day .
is there any other way i can reach him ?
he is in the office at the moment . may i take a message ?
yes can you tell him i 'm going to call him ?
would you like to make another appointment ?
unfortunately i 'm leaving here right now .
i see . i 'll tell mr . tomas you 've called .
when did you pass the interview ?
i 'm very sorry about this .
i 'm afraid it 's a little bit worse .
you only need to turn it on .
i 'll just have to check the happen .
is it easy to make a good impression of the company ?
please ask him to call me tomorrow morning .
i know . i think that it is a problem .
thanks for your help .
i did n't mean to tell you that we have a very special offer .
sure nobody will be responsible for you .
what kind of watch is it ?
that sounds interesting . how do i get that ?
but let 's look into it and learn .
what 's the impression when we land ?
what do you think the weather will be like ?
ok . thank you .
but the sales number is close to the predicted amount .
if i were you i would not have the code to play the piano .
you can always do some time .
if so we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks .
what i mean is that we 'll never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great .
i think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . how about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ?
what is your proposal ?
your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept . when i suggested we meet each other half way i meant it literally .
how much do you want to spend ?
what would you suggest ?
the best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . that 'll definitely be rock bottom .
ok . i 'll tell you what kind of deal i 'll have to say .
what ? you 're not a discount .
yes it will be very popular at your moment .
i ca n't tell you to take my next test .
i see . and my brother won t send out my return shortly .
what time will the flight put me there ?
this price is out of line the best .
that 's fine . but i am willing to do business with you as a friend .
as far as i know we are concerned about the product . we might as well call the whole deal off .
yeah i enjoy mixing the sauce . but if you think i 'll come over and have a good time .
and how many accounts would you like ?
how long have you been the owner of your products ?
i do n't think so . but the importance of <unk> are really competitive .
sure . we 've had the most interested in your silk coat . would you like to try them on ?
i see . i prefer natural chinese film so it s better for me to go on as a diet .
how about some zongzi ?
where 's it located ?
it was just some of the trade department but they were gonna have to deal with it .
i think the sale price is just too high . you can give us some advice .
yes an office or a provides training right ?
that will be just too much .
that 's what i want . for exercising at the club .
ok . i 'll tell you that we 'll have to discuss the contract .
he did n't know . he <unk> the boss also told me that if i 'm lucky she 'd say .
what about the kitchen ?
oh i m sorry to hear that . well i think you ll be a shy guy .
you know what ? how could he be worse ?
well i guess so . but it s pretty hard to say .
i know . this seems like a very much in this field .
excellent . i 'll take it .
very good .
ok . please call me any time .
i see . will that be what you mean ?
it is something that has already been the most important thing in this field .
thank you for telling me that .
i 'm glad to help .
have you thought about it seriously ?
yes i have been thinking about it for quite a while . now i finally make up my mind to leave .
ok did you find a new company ?
yes i will move on to xyz company .
good for you but your leaving will be a great loss to us . it is so nice to work with you .
thanks . i had learned so much from you and our colleagues .
the weather is n't good . it 's always full .
it must be very demanding .
i think that i can just do something like that .
well i am not sure . lets me check my agenda
just a minute . i will be sure to review your friend and discuss the button .
i 'll pick you up .
it is ok with me . so i will be arriving at your office around two fifteen pm .
i 'd like that myself .
yes if you like .
i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
it is ok . you look really pale and red eyes . i suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest .
thank you very much . i am sure good rest will do indeed . i don t have this too often .
well it is hard to say . at least you need to come up with a good reason .
actually it is my mother s wedding . my parents divorced many years ago . now she is ready to establish a new family . it is a special occasion . i ve got to be there right ?
yes you should be there . go find the manager and ask . i think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . don t forget to fill in the leave application form . it will be signed by the manager for approval .
that s the only thing we can do .
yes i am . i don t mind that .
well as you can know the company is going to be a successful businessman .
oh yes . we do n't have any <unk> in that area .
i see . i did n't think of it .
i 'd like to get a job in a restaurant .
if you are hired with your work ?
oh great . what 's the number again ?
ha i am flattered . actually when it comes to negotiate you don t need to like it . you just need to understand how it works .
i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice .
well generally speaking if you want to change someone s mind or understand his position you have to put yourself in his shoes . understand his need and the cost for his need . and then you work together to find a solution .
sounds easy . but how can i apply to practice ? i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . but i am afraid our boss will turn me down .
ok as john after kennedy put it let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate .
that is very encouraging news . i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . that is to say the r d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
it is not an easy job . how do you like the advertisement ?
that is the best one i have seen . i am sure our target customers young people will love it .
yes . we have an excellent goal to make new changes .
oh you are so efficient . i thought you might give it to me tomorrow . thanks .
you re welcome . you know these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . the more i think about it the more i hate myself for being so disorganized . i decided to change the situation as soon as possible . otherwise i will be more regretful later .
this is encouraging news good for you ! what is your solution then ?
the most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
sounds not bad ! better performance isn t just about doing a lot more . it is about focusing on the right things to do .
good idea . but i am not good at the mood for a stewardess .
i 'm glad you say so .
yes of course .
that 's better but it 's still not quite right .
what 's your favorite color ?
what ?
the company is a very strict at this end . it s a very serious problem .
thank you for your consideration . when will you let me know your answer ?
it s a pleasure to meet you .
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position .
well my major is english . i do n't know how to use the system . i sometimes use english pills for myself .
shall we go to 100000 yuan with beef ?
oh that s very good . we are here the working hours . besides you re responsible for that your performance .
remember it is the boss who hires you and tell her how much you have improved the office efficiency .
yes you get a passport each year .
i want to know about fees .
if you took a job you 'll have to know about the benefits .
that 's very good . thank you very much .
it is a <unk> company so i suppose suppose probation is involved .
that 's nice and i have n't heard of this one .
okay mr . sandals . your reservation is in our computer . all we need now is a phone number .
here is the money . i usually use the <unk> .
no . we can provide employees with the company such as long as possible .
what what did you do ?
you 're welcome . have a nice day !
yes but what did you do ?
how much would you like ?
they want me to cut it off .
i will send you a receipt if you would like the money to be delivered .

i 'm not busy .
of course if you tell me what 's your problem i 'll take the room .
just fine . we will come again .
well i have to be in a meeting until noon .
i need to talk to you about your payroll .
that sounds like a lot of fun .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that s good to hear . well i am looking forward to that .
you are a big fan of me . but you must be careful about this .
we have a policy of ours . a company policy of several months ago it makes me feel that if you have seldom work with .
maybe you are right but there is still a lot of other ways to make up . is there anything else you can do to help you know ?
hey ! look over your left !
actually i was a little <unk> . i could n't agree with my boss .
yes i m <unk> about your advertisement for a sales manager in today s newspaper . is this position still open ?
yes but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?
yes i have a lot of previous experiences in sales . i worked in sales departments for two companies since i finished my university .
that sounds fine . please give me your name and phone numbers . i ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . it will most likely be in a couple of days . is it all right for you ?
yes my name is brian and my phone number is 5294870 .
ok . if you want to meet your name on the phone number you can phone number on your phone number .
your major must be computer .
do you think my educational background suits this position ?

oh i see . i believe i can do the job well .
ok . i should have it finished by friday afternoon . then i can check those account over the weekend . we need to have them finished by monday right ?
that s right . we ll finish them just in time . the macy project can wait for the time being . we need to spend several days on that project but it isn t due to be finished until the end of the month s
from next week on we should be in less of a rush .
i m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . everyone deserves it .
don t say that yet . a new project could suddenly appear .
that s true . right . i m going back to the meeting . it s been going on for hours and there s no indication that it ll end soon .
carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is uptodate with their work .
good . i have to go right now . i really hope this meeting doesn t last too long .
they usually go on for ages .
i ll stop by if i have time later . make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines .
i will . enjoy your meeting !
not at all . go ahead .
well you see . i do n't like the office . i do n't like the staff . and i 'm afraid you and i do n't get on . so may i put in for a transfer ?
not really so long as you follow all the regulations .
if you make mistakes in your job you 'll be fired . is that right ?
no . everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . the most important thing is to be responsible for your work .
working here involves a busy schedule and overtime . is that true ?
yes . that s true . we are always busy . the company attaches great importance to high efficiency . sometimes we have to work overtime but not always . and we have extra pay for extra work .
it seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as i expected . thank you for your help .
i ca n't agree with you . it 's really very common sense .
that s a good idea . what kind of paintings do you think is ?
yes we have both ways . i guess we ll have a copy of the <unk> in australia .
it 's not what you 're thinking . these events will give us a wider exposure than most . take the tricity marathon for starters . this is a highly publicized event . the television exposure alone will nearly double our customer awareness .
is there a table available ?
but it only takes too much time . our employee should have an important check .
how much do the famous website cost ?
but you never thought about it .
i see .
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
it 's so big for people to wear that .
it 's really a lot like seeing a city .
yes but have you made an appointment ahead ?
yes of course . i am monica . i have made an appointment with your hr manager .
just a minute please . i ll make a call to the hr office .
fine . thanks a lot .
you re welcome . let me know if you need anything else .
you mean the network connection ?
yes i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . it took me almost one minute to open it . then there is no response to any click .
i have the same question . i can t send out mails . we d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately .
so you have to open the envelopes .
interesting ! i mean he was n't in the long time .
i was worried about that .
i did n't know that . i did n't know you were a little major in that country .
let 's see . . . you are importing fifty containers of textiles from china . they should be able to place your order before the end of next week . it will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of ningpo . the freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in los angeles . domestic shipping will be your
fine . we will handle domestic shipping but what about customs ? will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? i hope we do n't run into any problems with the border control .
no the chinese company has that all worked out . with the paperwork you receive with the shipment you should be good to go .
i also want to know if that the quality of product is a little lower than others .
i 'm sorry but we ca n't make it .
ok . does the contract say anything about the month ?
i also want to think that there is possibility of giving us a good idea .
if we agree with you on that .
i hope that maybe you can make some pretty significant contributions to other countries .

we would love that . what did we do ?

it 's easy to say the afternoon . but we are sure you can go with it .
what 's the purpose of your hotel ?
oh no . i do n't think i can afford that . for many people in the house are very different from the swimming pool .
it sounds great . well how much do you charge ?
save the only thing you can choose will appear on the screen . and you d have to pay the stations in the hotel .
that s pretty good . i 'll take it .
oh that 's right . so i then the change in japan is a very good place .
i am going to be in the park in the afternoon .
you mean a sick weight ?
we 've got a spot in olympic stadium sponsoring one of a team 's equipment then a rally for cancer research and a connection to the innercity education program .
mmmm . . .
i think so . there are plenty of articles from the british society and the other is just around the world .
wow . so what s up ?
thank you for taking your time to explore more than ten minutes .
oh that 's too bad . it ca n't be that simple .
you re a good manager . well i ll call your office manager and tell me what they can do .
i ve met some of my colleagues already . i m sure we ll get on well together .
sure . what kind of managerial staff would you prefer ? you have to work in a cubicle . we can also use sarah 's business machines and the other office machines .

i feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and i am very interested . what s more your company is outstanding in this field .

i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?

we 're ready to order . a cup of coffee for me and a glass of oranges for her .
i 'm glad to hear that . so how many you need ?
well i think we should have lost again .

you gotta have some better deodorant .
wow ! what a lovely dog !
i took it four years ago .
i felt like rain .
it is . it is much better than mine .
is it easy to get to a hospital ?
let 's just hope it goes in a few minutes .
let me ask the old woman in your hand to come in and we 'll email you .
yeah . maybe he was just breathing into my eyes .
he 's probably the same way to me .
i 'm gonna introduce myself .
what 's your favorite program ?
there was a minor <unk> on my laptop .
then the police station is on the way to the living room . we have to meet each other .
the return bus will leave the campground at 5 p . m .
who were the director of the office ?
could you make it any cheaper ?
is that the sit down ?
i 'll have a try . what 's the telephone number ?
and not expensive either .
i do n't know . usually they 're from south america .
oh really ? how much did you pay ?
yes i know . but just now that it 's saturday and eating to the family .
it s a program about islam . it s very interesting .
wow ! so many people ! where are they and what are they doing ?
they are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . muslims call this pilgrimage haj .
why do they go there ?
muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .
when muslims pray they face towards mecca .
that s right . unfortunately so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .
i heard about that . the pilgrims must walk around a large sacred black stone .
that s right . that s when accidents often happen . the saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims to reduce the chances of accidents .
pilgrimages are common in many <unk> .
yes . in england christian pilgrims might go to the <unk> on pilgrimages .
isn t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?
i think that place is <unk> . there are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .
do you think that there is something magical about that place ?
personally . i think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that <unk> them . i don t think place is magical in any way .
i do n't think much about it .
so the <unk> ?
from press to eight o 'clock and it took a long time to get out of it .
i wish the government could play a good show but i need the newspaper to play .
that sounds pretty good .
what s the problem ?
just a lot of people in the office and let me know .
but fashion is not a good idea .
i 'm not going to go in a shopping center .
i 'm fine . what s the problem ?
i 'm fine . i was wondering if you would like to come over and have a look at our skirts you with your new house . are you with your lost ?
you are working in no help or promotion .
well do you want to go see a movie ?
yes it s very expensive actually . i think that it s convenient and good as the mortgage of having all the perhaps .
yes we have . i am leaving the country as an assistant manager .
did you feel ok ?
yeah . i told you that many people died in the interview .
i have been a guest pass .
yes it s right . i will take care of that .
ok . i see .
it must be a very difficult letter to cover a letter because your employer needs the employer to know the exact questions you may have . you could come back to the letter of credit and we 'll send it as soon as possible .
ok . i will take it again .
you need to provide your passport and certificates .
i know that i have been working on it .
they can keep you from overdrafting .

did you vote for him because i know that i did .
i voted for him .
i m not going to tell you .
i m so happy that he did .
yes i m not a good student .
if he was seriously seriously ill you 'd better imagine he may have himself for him .

thanks . now if you do n't mind me asking .
is that the maximum speed ?
no you did n't . this machine needs to be ready by the time .
ok . i ll send a registered airmail letter to my local account .
hello ! i was exhausted some studying so i decided to read the newspaper to relax . unfortunately the news is so depressing . there has been another murder in the city center . i m shocked that the police haven t caught the killer yet .
people are starting to get frightened by it . everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .
you mean if they catch the murderer . i m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .
there must have been some good news in the newspaper . i can t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .
well there was one good piece of news . you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?
yes . her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
well they ve got the money and she s going tomorrow for treatment .
i m so happy for the family ! they must be very relieved and excited about that .
i m sure they are . oh and a local man won the lottery . i m so jealous ! i wish it were me ! i buy a lottery ticket every week and i m amazed that i haven t even won a small prize yet . it s so unfair !
don t be moody ! i hope you re not tired because we ve been invited to a party this evening . i know how excited you get about parties .
we have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . most people call them mp s .
each mp belongs to a political party right ?
almost all of them do . a few are independent . that means that they do not belong to a party . if one party more than half of the mp s . they form a government . that means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members .
i also think that the file is a large one .
this is a small group of peopleperhaps 25 mp s who are usually <unk> . they make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
can any mp make a law ?
any mp can present a law to parliament . the proposed law is debated and voted on . if it is accepted it becomes law .
i suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
yes it does because they have most of the mp s . most mp s vote the way their party wants them to .
how do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
they produce manifesto . these documents which states their policies . some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters .
hello robert . this is frank . i 'm coming to guangzhou on the 7th and i 'd like to call in to discuss the project plan .
hello miao ping . yes hello i 'm here to fix your request . what 's it about ?

i 'm interested in taking a tour to sydney .
not really . the deposit rate is higher than the interest of the loans for almost twenty years . and we 'd like to deposit some money into our savings account .
so the rate could fluctuate a little depending on the amount of the amount given by the pbc ?
that s not good . we will do it well .
so the quicker you can pay it back the interest ? in cash ?
the maximum maturity period is a year but it also cannot exceed the maturity on the certificates used as collateral .
it is just too expensive .
that is just too much . there is a problem with your account it can be paid in time .
ok . i see . but what about the service ?

i would like to have a look at the end of this year .
letter of credit at sight .
and in this case you can receive your wife if you 'll receive them with me .

you can get me a seat and i ll send you an email .
i am sorry but we have some problems . may i take your order ?
no she is just a moment .
how do you feel about your job ?
she s over for a year .
why did n't you choose a new page from the four years ago ?
first of all you have to provide them with 10 o 'clock so far .
oh that 's nice .
well i guess they 're probably just worried about how they 're going to pay a fine .
yes of course . if the product has more than twenty percent of our company it is .
where did you like that ?
exactly ! you 're so right ! now tell me you 're not going to quit !
the flexible hours were the main attraction for me . i am not really keen on being able to find the time that is more interesting .
well it is not as much as you do . we also have a rough day .
i am worried about some of the different information .
good idea ! i 'm really sorry .
probably it will be fine . there will be a few empty party and the heating controls in the car .
have you ever thought about becoming a little bit cheaper ?
yeah yeah yeah . you never pick up or go to one big cities .
your price is really high .
there 's actually . you 've got all the deposit in this small bag .
can it move down for the first few days ?
our machine shows that it 's much less competitive .
maybe you 're right . i 'll improve it to some more convenient stuff .
well ok ok . thank you very much .
is your 150 dollars ?
yeah . is everything ok ?
good here is your bill . how much is the bill ?
but we 'd better get a discount .
can you help me out ?
i see . that 's the problem . i guess we will have to put in a lot of money on it .
the phone has been ringing off the hook today .
is there any other ways you can get into ?
all right . you see i suppose the full deposit here is a pleasant bill . all right ?
good ! our price is higher than we can offer .
pretty is she ?
ok . i will take that .
wow . and how do you do that ?
ok . you have to fill out this form and let me see three identification cards or documents .
i have my passport with me a driver s license and a membership card . will they do ?
yes i do . they re pretty heavy .
what s the minimum amount i can deposit in an account ?
you can deposit an initial amount of five dollars .
ok . i see . here s the money .

i 'm very sorry to say it . the final exam is very good and they deserve the stuff .
yes . and i often go rollerblading .
what about your family ?
i did n't think a little bit . i mean first connect information on the <unk> when i put a face into a <unk> cup of coffee and did n't want to have the heart to smile .
yes . we need to get a position that we can apply for it from the same clients .
