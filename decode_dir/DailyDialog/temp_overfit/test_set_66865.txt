no . . . .
hey !
oh look ! i 've never seen such a red dress . it 's the latest in red .
it seems that i have been very busy these days .
yes i did . i had to be a tour guide so i learned to use a lot from different departments .
how can you do that ?
i ca n't remember but she 's only 29 . 95 .
here we are .
not really . she likes to to work at a time . i think we should be on the same day .
i see . how do you feel about having her goals ?
never mind .
cool down harry ! what are you really mad about ? did you get ripped off ?
yes . last sunday i went to a nearby market . it was on <unk> fair . i chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot without even trying to strike a bargain . i paid one hundred and twenty . and just
is that so ? i 'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . it 's the norm of free trade . the seller sets
but do n't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?
of course that 's something really irritation . and the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . i recommend you to consult the price tags in the superb
that 's not a problem . we can book you a private room for up to ten people at that time . could you give me your name please ?
i know . i promise i wo n't be sleepy tomorrow . i work really hard .
we have to eat a lot of vegetables and eat . because we are so different from our country !
we are so . eat more !
i do n't know . i just do n't have very time .
i go to bed at ten and get up at six .
that 's helpful for your health .
ok i 'll take a walk .
yes .
really ? does mary know that ?
what about his hair ?
all right . i 'm really looking forward to it .
yes you 're right . i will wait until i get there . thanks for your help .
ok .
who s calling ?
yes please tell her that band practice has been moved to tuesday night at eight thirty .
thanks . see you at the moment .
you need to maintain a minimum balance of 100 .
i like it .
sure we do . here you are .
would you mind if i helped out in the kitchen instead ? i do enjoy cooking .
this is supposed to be your vacation we 'd like you to just relax .
cooking makes me feel relaxed . so what are we cooking ?
ok well we 're going to make a pan of lasagne a salad and some garlic bread . here 's the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?
sure . we should probably preheat the oven right away too .
that 's a good idea . can you set the oven to 200 degrees celsius ?
that 's a bit high for lasagne . i 'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there .
fine . i 'll just get out the casserole dish the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the baking sheet .
you know i could do this myself . why do n't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ?
i do n't think it 's broken .
can you do something about it ?
fine . i 'll go vacuum . let me know if you need any other help .
yes of course . it 's a nice view .
will it take me straight there ?
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn right .
thank you .
i think you should get off at the next stop .
thank you very much .
it 's a fortyfive minute to an hour ride .
thank you .
you are welcome . hope you can find it soon .
of course . is the dinner still on ?
yes i was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .
we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .
that 's what i thought you would do . listen i live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . it 's just down the street from all the bars . you probably do n't want to be walking around after dark . there 's a dance floor on the other hand . you are going out there .
it ca n't be that bad . it 's a good idea to do some exercise .
but it is ! take this morning for example . the subway was so packed this morning i got totally squished by about a hundred busy <unk> on the way to work .
really ? i never would have guessed . the criminals must only come out in the evenings because i 've never noticed anything strange when i 've been at your house in the daytime .
i think it 's a murder mystery based on the back of the city .
ok we will . how do you get around in the evenings ?
when i first moved in i walked everywhere . but within a week i had my purse stolen just a block away from the police station ! now i always take public transportation .
has anything else happened to you ?
nothing else has happened to me but i have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close .
well we 'll be careful . thanks for letting me know .
it s not very expensive . it s it depends on your turn .
are there many accidents in the city every day ?
my heart is frozen .
that 's right .
any rain ?
i hope that the traffic is not heavy .
it was my pleasure .
i 've been working a lot lately .
no i 'm not . what 's your name ?
i got it .
that 's terrible . is your boss coming by ?
i believe that two people did get hurt .
that 's great . give me the landscape of the game .
i 'm sorry but to be frank it 's all of us .
what 's that ?
they are ! i guess the most important thing is that the people will like the whole world .
not yet . may i take a message ?
we could easily provide you with a private vehicle if you 'd like .
we have various rooms available .
the cream of olives is really a kind of medium .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . it 's my turn .
i have a taxi will be here in a minute .
no problem . do n't worry the taxi is faster than the bus .
the competition will begin in 5 minutes .
you know i hate shopping more than anything else in this world .
i know . but we could get some exercise in and we could get some errands run too . windowshopping won t cost you anything .
what kind of errands do we need to run ?
well we could go to the newsagent s to pick up the sunday paper go to the butcher s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner and to the chemist s to pick up your prescription from the doctor .
i 'll only go if we can stop at the to pick up something to drink for tonight .
fine . we 'll go to the latin club and there 's a banquet by the way . there 's a whole afternoon at the bar .
sounds good . we will come back in an hour .
i promise . we re only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven t had time for .
ok let s go then .
wait a minute . let me throw on a sweater .
no i do n't .
i need to pay my bills .
what kind of benefit are you interested in ?
i agreed to not go into the mall but i can still look at things in the market !

toyota 2002 .

it s the one who offered of a job right now .

of course . is there anything wrong ?
ok .
because i m not in the mood that s why .
well don t just sit there do something . come and help me in the kitchen .
help you in the kitchen i don t feel like it .
would you like to clear the table then ?
really ? do i have to do it ?
not if you don t want to .
really it 's so beautiful .
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
you must n't pick it in this place .
where it is ?
it is at the north of forbidden city on the central axis of beijing .
yeah it 's not you ?
i bought this here yesterday but it does n't work .
why not ?
i spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat .
i 'm afraid so .
i know what you mean . it says i ca n't bear it .
sorry i 'm very near sighted .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do it again .
you see . when will it be here then ?
it was ? wow ! i thought we 'd just have a look at it !
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you them .
i am not surprised you eat too much .
and i suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office does n't help .
no i would n't think so .
i do wish i could lose weight .
well why do n't you go on the diet ?
i 've tried diets before but they 've never worked .
why do n't you go to the supermarket ?
yes maybe i should .
that is just an excuse . you can always find some time to exercise .
but i work hard all the time for long hours . often i have no time for lunch . yet i am still getting fatter .
bill you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . and skipping meals will not help you lose weight . in fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals .
i know you 're right but what can i do ?
we are ready to place our christmas orders and we need to know about how much it 's going to have to pay .
but i 'll miss the news . it 's important in my business to keep up with events in china .
i know i know . have you got a portable radio ? you can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time .
that 's a good idea !
i want a pair of black ones .
here you are .
i love the bamboo design . what is it ?
i think you should go to the jewish museum . it s not far from the south .
they 're in aisle two .
ok . let me try it .
sure . what time do you want to go ?
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
well i swim and run every day .
now tell me what do you eat ?
well i do n't eat any meat but i do eat fish and eggs .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
oh yes and fruit i love fruit .
what do you drink ?
well i never drink alcohol coffee or tea .
what do you drink ?
you too . have you lost some weight ?
yes i took off 4 kilos . i am glad you notice it .
not some crazy diet fat i hope .
no no no no no no i just changed my eating habits . i eat a balance meal . and i eat a lot of milk .
what do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ?
ah yes mr . wang . this is smith .
yes this is calling .
this is alex .
i understand . i ll bring the full call home office first .
please .
no thanks . i 've had enough .
actually you have n't had much .
to tell you the truth i am on the diet .
that sounds ridiculous . why ?
well i am gaining weight these days and i have to watch my calories .
no do n't try to tend me . i 'm becoming chubby and i have to slender down .
you are not too scared . i do n't think you 'd like to change them .
i do n't think so . i know i 've put on weight this winter .
so you are watching your weight are n't you ?
yes to tell you the truth . i am on the diet .
where are you heading now ?
i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road . it is very close to your house .
is that the university next to the teachers college ?
that 's the one .
you mean we 'll share the taxi ?
yeah . if we share the cab it 'll be cheaper . besides that your chinese is better than mine . the drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though i practice my pronunciation carefully .
well . don t worry about it i will be happy to share the taxi with you .
take me to the airport please .
are you in a hurry ?
i am leaving right now .
good . how about this steak ?
there 's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
i 'll do my best .
here 's twenty dollars .
yes . here 's your ticket .
no . if you ca n't break it keep the change . but can you give me a receipt ?
here is your receipt . thank you .
yes they all stop at this corner .
how long does it take to get there ?
you can take any bus except the number 9 .
number 13 buses run much more frequently do n't they ?
they run about every five minutes .

what size ?

i promise i will .
well the garbage disposal doesn t work we have rats and the toilet is backed up .
where did you see it ?
i like the style of this dress . it s very relaxing . i usually prefer something to go with the ingredients .
it 's a great idea . the bedroom is a little small for us .
you are not english are you ?
i have been through a lot of problems . i found that i had not been able to come in any of the way .
what 's the problem ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .

you should check the connections .
nothing else has to do with it .
where did you see it ?
i know . there s a lawn outside the building and the windows door is great .
i m happy to hear you say that .

the rent is 725 each month .
that s way too much .
it s a 850 account .

it s a good idea .
what does the job description say ?
i 'm not sure but i pay more than that .
okay mr . horn see you tomorrow at 1030 .
i checked it out of the kitchen and it turns out that i was under the problem .
i had a home inspection before but didn t really understand it .
can you describe for me where you are located ?
we are going to look at the problem . is there anything else ?
i think that the owners must fix all of the problems before the escrow closes .
i can predict it will have the largest circulation in one or two years .
for the owners you have no problems with the house .
that 's good to hear . please try to get them fixed .
it has a really busy day . i had to get rid of the house and was it repaired . i m going to get it all over and let it right away .
if you would like to confirm the reservation with a available flight on october 12th and leave the front desk .
will the electricity be on or do we need to do something to help ?
make sure that you transfer the utilities to your name and tell them when you will be checked out .
i really want to paint the walls right away and get the carpet cleaned .
so what did you do to help me with it ?
where is the white house located ?
i think that will work out just fine . i can fix that for you .
well that 's great . what about the price ? is it good ?
i would like to come in on tuesday .
yes . which one is the brake again ?
the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas .
i m glad this car is an automatic . i do n't like having to change gears .
automatics are very simple to drive . the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver s seat !
i understand . thank you for coming .
i can t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . could you move it forward a bit please ?
how s that ?
i sent in an absentee ballot .
check your petrol situation .
the tank is almost empty . i guess i ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up .
that s a good idea . put your keys in the ignition start it up put the car in reserve wait for the road to be clear and then back out of the .
i got it . don t worry . i ll get you there in one piece .
remember no honking this time . the horn is only for emergencies !
why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ?
i 'm not quitting yet . you know my favourite slogan do n't you ?
yeah i know . shop till you drop .
ok .
and that 's it . you 're done .
ok .
i 'm sorry but i ordered sole not the same as the others . will you change it ?
ahahah and i thought you were tired .
you know . . i have a weakness for long dresses .
it sure looks special looks expensive too .
sure does . hey can i a little cash of you ?
yes please .
you know that i have to work for the family before . the company rule the company does n't understand me at all .
eyes you sent them to new york right ?
that 's right . i thought i 'd come back to buy a few more souvenirs .
you need n't worry about it . there are many stores at the scenic spots . i 'm sure you can get what you want .
well first i 'd like to buy a few postcards . my sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . i want to do that too .
we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . the same designs can be found on these posters .
are there any special effects ?
yes we do . they 're on the wall behind you .
how much do they cost ?
the prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask . would you like me to get one down for you to look at ?
yes i think i 'd like the green mask in the middle .
very good . do you want me to show you the way ?
thank you very much .
are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift ?
i 'll have a try .
we 've got plenty to choose from here .
they look delicious . i think she 'll be pleased .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
you 're going to get a ticket for that .
i can t believe it .
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much . we have a beautiful day .
wow ! you really went to that movie last week !
yes i am . i really do n't feel like cooking but i 'm still suffering from jet lag .
no you can learn a lot from them .
what can i do for you ?
yes . you have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . you can compare them to the floor . it took a small cupboard for toiletries . the bath shower and washbasin are the same as before aren t they ?
do n't you think that is too dangerous ?
although this is the rush hour you can just take it to the office .
well there 's a folk concert on grant street . you look look very smart .
ok . i have a form of id card .
can you recommend some <unk> ?
yes i am . what are you thinking of getting ?
no need ! i 'm tired and i 'm still in a good mood .
go to window number eleven .
sorry but he 's busy then too .
i know but i 'm really tired .
yeah .
i want to make a list of all the stuff in this backpack .
well i really like being with you .
no problem .
ok . i guess we can go there after lunch .
i think that it was bad service but i heard it was on the way to <unk> food .
i 'm just a little tired .
what 's so great about it ?
it 's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances .
not to me i would n't be caught dead in that .
i love that kind of stuff .
yeah you seem to like those styles .
sure do . i get a kick out of looking <unk> .
this one looks really expensive though .
i do n't care how much it costs . i 'm rolling in it .
lucky you ! i ca n't buy anything else . i 'm flat broke .
i got a replace my party outfit i trashed it last week .
why did you drag me into this ? i 've spent a week salary .
are you on the level ? you 're the one who called me remember ?
just joking t . i 've got some wonderful clothes . let 's go and have a close look at your outfit .
you can buy the bubble wrap here but you ll have to stand in line over here to post your package .
that s a good idea . after i get rid of the plant i think i ll get a 20 .
it takes about 3 minutes per person so it ll probably be about an hour s wait .
can i buy stamps here ?
sure . how many would you like ?
i need 30 for my christmas cards .
are you sending them abroad ?

do you know how many employers you need ?
you can get it from the student business office .
how long did you have all the money for ?

i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . jones needs a telephone call from you .
good night then !
excuse me sir . where 'd you get off ?
give me a minute .
it s hard to get there .
have a pleasant stay .
i could n't agree with you .
but both my favorite cars are a bit expensive .
is it because of the speed of the conversation ?
well i have got you three first class tickets and i have reserved your seats . your seat numbers are 8a 8b and 8c .
you 're right . we 'd better go for the bus .
i ca n't believe it . it was n't a good thing .
you should 've just pay someone for it .
we have some fresh red roses .

20 per dozen .
that sounds good . last year i paid 30 .
yes they 're on sale today .
i 'll take a dozen .

our school did . they played really well .
what was the score ?
seventy to sixtyseven .
your lease isn t up yet .
i can t decide yet .
that s a pity .
that will be ninetyfive cents in all .
because i love the snow .

of course not . it s just a part of the building .
i won t be able to stay here anymore .
ok . i will take you .
that s what i charge .
that s an excuse .
you just missed one .
what is the time we meet ?
no way . we can not find the way to the bus .
anyway how was your such catherine ?
i 'd rather not . i 'm afraid i 'll have to wait for a long time .
i 've heard that when this happens it 's important to save energy .
well i guess i was walking down and i 'm not sure . i 'm a stranger .
i really do n't think this mall has been a little too far away for us .
yeah it 's hard to believe but true .
i really do n't know how .
i messed up .
yes that 's just right . i really want to get her something special .
good . can you please get me there in the address ? i am a stranger here .
no really . i 'm always absentminded .
do you have any idea where we are ?
it only takes 45 minutes to an hour .
can you make it in 15 minutes ?
we will ask for a stops if we need a stops .
it 's a really nice choice .
yeah . sometimes i really feel like writing a letter to the mayor .
what can i do with my baggage ?
it is . our customers really like it . do you have any other questions about your new accounts ?
you mean the no one next to the no . 1 bus stop ?
yes we are . what kind of job are you looking for ?
you can catch the <unk> .
i am also wondering about the time of the day .
no you ca n't go ahead . it 's a long way to go .
well i guess you should have it outside .
it 's a very nice person .
well do you know for sure ?
come on . i would be happy to talk to you .
i think you know .
no problem .
i really like that outfit .
ok . it 's a deal .
i honestly do n't know .
oh good .
it 's about fortyfive minutes to an hour .
oh does it really a long way to go .
we can get both at the cafeteria .
it 's a really good idea .
yeah . i saw that there was a stop sign .
i 've been been driving for a while .
how about some fish ?
i do n't know .
i ca n't agree more .
we have to wait six more minutes !
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
i think this is the right bus .
if you totally agree i 'll type the agreement this evening and have it duplicated for <unk> .
i honestly did n't know .
i do n't think this is a very good thing .
yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that .
i thought you knew .
i 'm not going to get to you .
it only gets crowded once it gets to la .
well i guess you should have it outside .
yes .
do you have a map of the bus ?
it only takes 45 minutes .
then we 'll have it .
you get off at the 50 miles .
it 's really a big choice .
yeah i already knew there was a catch .
oh my god ! i have never seen such a thing .
okay so friday at what time ?
i need to make a transfer .
were you looking at a particular refrigerator ?
i 'd like a cup of black tea .
this particular refrigerator is a very good choice .
i have chosen january as the month for this retreat .
you need to keep it at 100 .
well it has been a problem with it for three days .
it s an ice maker water dispenser and plenty of room on the inside .
i 'd like to see that myself .
be my guest .
what a beautiful view !
you came to the right place . any particular decade ?
if you had a box made in the 20s that would be nice .
we just got one in yesterday so now we have six .
what time did you have in mind ?
yes we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures .
oh they 're both so beautiful . let me have this one i think .
that one truly is a beautiful piece of work is n't it ?
one last question
oh no . everything we sell here is as is .
i guess i was asking for too much .
if it breaks down maybe you can find a repairman on the internet .
i need to cancel one of my accounts .
how many guests do you need ?
i was looking at this kenmore refrigerator .
this particular refrigerator is a very good choice .
what 's so great about it ?
it 's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances .

it comes with an ice maker water dispenser and there is a lot of room inside .
i 'd like to see it for myself .

you wo n't be able to tell the difference with a magnifying glass .
. . . okay i 'm through . here 's the form and my old card .
thank you . your order will be ready seven days from now .
now that i think of it three days is better than seven .
we can do that but you 'll have to pay a little extra .

that 's a good idea .
i 'm sorry but i ordered sole not the same as the others . will you change it ?
oh it s time to have lunch now .

what is the customer service charge ?
no . i do n't mind . however i have to use my gym .
yeah i think so . which one is better ?
i 'm starving too .
i do n't think this is right .
i see . do n't worry . we have a bus for about half an hour .

ok i ll do that .
no she s out of house .
i 'd like to buy some perfume for my girlfriend .

i hope it 's not gonna break into three digits
i 'm sorry but i ordered sole not the same as the others . will you change it ?
do you have a fever ?

have you the classes yet ?
i know but i m really looking for this kind of job .
well . i 'm an english major . so i do n't know what to say .
i have a tuition scholarship from the university . otherwise i m not really sure i d be good enough to learn how to school .
do you think you are the right candidate for graduation ?
i m getting to the final exam . you ve got to be there ! i m not really funny about going out to write my own place .
why is it the same in korea ?
most of them do .
are they filed alphabetically ?
that 's a relief . it 's a good thing we moved .
yes . i think it is not an easy job . the united states are dealing with overseas firm .
yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that .
oh i learned that he is really using a professional language . i learned a lot from that experience .
it was in a small town in sydney .
oh i learned that he is really using the language . i learned a lot from english and i feel very difficult to learn in the language .
oh no . there are only one to be .
what are the special effects of these things ?
you 're right . but when you get it fixed it was n't a problem .
i see . would you mind if i checked in the room ?
they wanted to go to their wedding in my family .
some of the schools are going to give their students money to the study . they said the same thing .
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more .
you should n't be serious about that .
about four years ago .
but the chairman said he was really outstanding .
honestly it seems that the work was so boring .
what are you doing here ?
you re right . we just wasn t . we were going to talk about anything .
what are we going to do ?
i have the final decision . why do you choose the english ?
ok . i know what to do now . thank you very much .
yeah and i also got much pressure in the company . i have to be honest about future .
they do n't mind . i 'm still feeling good .
yes i liked it too . did you like the acting ?
not really . what 's the difference between the two ?
then you must despise such modern music as rock ?
boxing . it 's quite a favorite .
i see .
no i did n't .
how long have you been study hard ?
i 'm sorry . i 'm afraid the employer is too busy .
hold on a minute please .
he 'll be a lawyer .
and he 's so handsome .
i got a character stomachache .
you 're going to be well . with your expertise and experience you 're not the only one .
i agree . he only mentioned how to put a job on it .
no it 's a great place to watch . what are you going to do ?
if you had given me cash do you have it now ?
sounds like a very good idea .
nothing much . i 'm just tired .
i know for sure that you will be ok .
i 'm just too tired to get my food from work .
well you get used to it . i guess you can eat a lot more . are you sure you ll be spending a lot of money on your break ?
i 'm going to go rest now .
as the saying goes work while you work play while play . all work and no play makes jack a dull boy you know ?
oh i have to take a taxi . you can take the test again .
i 'm just shopping .
what 's the tv program ?
i 'm going to really into watching football .
do you play football ?
would you like to cancel a reservation ?
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
they 're trying to find a more favorable experience than people used to do their language .
you are right . i just wish i could be a good friend and a little more .
i see . this one costs more but it has a fine taste . do you have any other ideas ?
there are many kinds of like in one place . our prices are very popular .
ok let 's do it .
yes there is . it has very large portions of natural scenery .
yes . these are my favourite hobbies . what about these ?
you mean you want to stay at home ?
nice to meet you lvan . my name is alike . i 'm from japan .
nice to meet you too .
a second language is always difficult .
true but english is harder than most . it s a crazy language .
a crazy language ? why do you say that ?
one letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .
no wonder you say english is a crazy language .
i ve been here for 5 years . how about you ?
okay .
i have a driver 's license .
did you get any foreign friends ?
to be honest i like most of them except for my chinese teacher . she is quite young but her class is too boring !
i agree . he s really a shoulder to cry on .
she 's ok . she told me she 's a bit tired .
i think it 's a good way to develop our language ability .
she 's in the hospital with my dad . i have to go back tonight .
did she tell you why she didn t buy it for a change ?
i think she was right .
i guess it has a lot of homework to learn .
yes .
i 'll give you a shot .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
what is it ? you are taking a break ! what s that ?
that s great . i ll see you later .
you must feel really worried right now . but you know your dad is a fighter .
no . i just got to know .
today 's children have not the chance to play to make fun of them . they are usually singing outside .
i do n't know .
you 're right . her husband is not in the whole country .
she was a naughty boy and i played hooky . so the school gave me a punishment to clear the classroom for a week .
really ? how do you feel about that ?
i learned to drive and i 'm learning it now .
but i ca n't say that she would do much better than her .
sure . if you ask me i 'll write a letter of recommendation .
i know . but it 's not my fault .
no . i don t know what her name . i don t know what her favorite groups are all blond .
what about your experience ?
sure . i know how to control her . you must be .
well they re really going to have to be a lot of fun .
no it s a girl . my wife likes dogs but she says she wants to have a dog .
i also think she will have a bottle of champagne lobster tail and filet mignon medium rare .
i do n't know . but i am sure she is .
really ? quite a woman isn t she ?
yes . but i like to read books on vary subjects and i can read everything i can get my hands on the channel .
i thought they were going to be a mathematician .
it s this question .
you ca n't help learning when you 're using it all day . you 'll see . a few weeks study in the school will have a similar effect on you .
i hope so . you see at the moment i find it difficult to get used to the teacher 's speed and accent . i 'm awfully worried i ca n't reply as quickly as she seems to expect .
oh she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use english throughout the class . she does n't mind your making mistakes though .
you know speaking in class is a very good chance to put your english to practical use .
that 's the new teacher .
and who 's your favorite singer ?
she 's very nice .
what does she teach ?
english of course .
is she your teacher ?

he sure is .
here 's your ticket .
i had the library come out of the station for him .
i bet he is . he domed his own life .
what 's your idea ?
but he s really lucky .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
i 'm sorry . i did n't know that .
what is good for you ?
really ? i thought he was doing well .
yes he is . he loves the girl very much .
that 's interesting .
how about some cold tablets and some pancakes for the children ?
i know .
does he have a lot of homework ?
did he know that he was purchased to it ?
that 's great to know .

i see . thank you for your time .
no problem .
thank you . i m sure i will love it .
a playpen and crib ! thanks carla ! this is just what i needed !
yes it 's very nice of you to say so .

all right . i 'll tell her you 're such a best day .
it 's made of wool .
certainly . let me look at the pamphlet .
very good . would you like a manicure ?
i 'm not paying for it but i 've got to pay for it .
how long did you stay there ?
yes i do . it s very interesting . what s your job ?
i like the colour very much . it looks like you have a blue one .
oh i do n't care about that .
of course i could ! i could n't have had it any years .
can you name some of the chinese students who speak them ?
i will listen to your advice .
it 's not a bad idea .
oh we all know if we 're trying to help us with it .
oh it s my favorite . i like it very much .
you 'll get used to it .
but i ca n't wait to see it .
you 're making a special offer today .
thank you . it 's been a pleasure to have this job .
see you .
i see .
why are you suddenly interested in it ?

i 'm leaving on the 17th .

you know . i took part in the chinese contest . i was the best and they gave me this reward . i don t have to pay for my trip .
what ?
yes i was supposed to write some information about it .
i want to watch it but i have to watch it .
i did n't sleep much last night .
sure . i 'm looking for a pair of books who works out best .
but i ca n't see it .
yes she is . she is good at backstroke and free style .
ok . let 's go .
i do n't really know .
i see . you 're right sir . i 'll come back later .
glad to meet you .
how about next time we meet at my place ? and i ll treat you to chinese food . i know how much you like it . we can order in and watch video too . anything you like i promise .
so you are a wet blanket .
i 'm afraid it 's the trick .
i hear you have to be a heavy smoker .
it 's a special kind of medicine . it 's so small that i do n't have any laundry .
he 's on a <unk> <unk> <unk> retreat and wo n't be back until the weekend .
you 're going to have to call his girlfriend . i 'm looking for him .
you 're right . he just broke up with ann .
you are lucky . it s a lovely girl .
just follow the instructions . all the machines have to be made in our system .
i did n't know that .
it 's really a good game .
yes i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
me too . oh peter i talk to you about your family . i 'm going to be a party for you . see you .
haha . . . you should never give up my mind . it 's about time to calm down .
yes it is . the board went through each set .
i hope my family will be like a baby .
are you sure ?
yes i did .
i love you happy anniversary .
i do n't think much of the film .
i think it is the worst one i have ever seen .
oh i 'm not sure i agree with you . it was not a good one but it was not the worst one . actually it was n't too bad .
i ca n't think the same .
what 's more some scenes were good much fit for the children .
i could n't agree with you .
yes sir . how may i be of service ?
it 's too late .
i will .
i 'm sorry to say that we have to let you go john .
when is the best time for you ?
i can solve it thanks .
we will keep and return it later .
please excuse me wo n't we ?
i hope so . well thank you for coming .
pretty good . i ve just had my new poems published .
what position did you play ?
thank you .
i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . jones needs a telephone call from you .
he is fine .
he s going to be sent to britain to study really ?
yes . he s already got the passport and visa .
fantastic ! please send him my congratulations .
thank you . he s very lucky indeed .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
it 's ok .
because i have found out how to improve myself in school .
it 's a beautiful view . and also the air is cool .
there is a difference .
right . but i 'm not really worried about what you 're doing !
really ? i ca n't believe it .
yes . i find it very favorable .
we are here today . you 're done .
i 'm sick of it too .
the door bell does n't work the sink is leaking
it 's no use complaining . if we had got enough money we could n't put up with it and would have moved out .
mmm you 're right .
how could i feel easy ? i m really pissed .
but you should avoid <unk> when you haven t got the real facts .
ok . i ll try my best to calm down first .
oh i am very sorry hans . thank you for waiting for me . you must have been here a long time already .
it s all right .
i was caught in the heavy rain or i would have come earlier . i am sorry i kept you waiting .
i was in a comfortable place so really it s no problem . i am happy to see you . did the rain hold you up long ?
yes . when i came out of the subway it was raining cats and dogs . and i forgot my umbrella . so i had to wait for the rain to let up .
i totally understand .
she didn t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day s hard work .
poor girl !
not much except that my motherinlaw is driving me up the wall .
what 's the problem ?
i ca n't work out this problem .
your motherinlaw is always seems to like that .
we did n't pay attention to the environment cut down trees and polluted the air .
no i ca n't see that happening . i know you 're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
it 's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .
my motherinlaw used to do the same thing to us . if it was n't disciplining them enough then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we sent them the schools we sent them too and everything else under the sun .
you 're right we do need too many people . what we should give you a hand . you know what we need is a good friend .
no i just saw her in the car . i think it was too far to answer her .
i suppose you 're right . she 's probably just a good friend to help her .
hi !
sure . i just wanted to have a really bad toothache ! i m tired of lying in the movie .
but you must have been tired .
oh dear . i can t make it .
that 's very good .
my first job is in a wellestablished company where the employees are very clear and we like to work with customers . i will try to improve our work with our work .
no thanks . i can t wait .
no i don t . i m a tourist .
and you re going to be there in a minute .
i will . thank you very much .
i said you were n't supposed to know anything .
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . .
that does sound a great idea . we can also find a suitable job for him .
how much do you think i should give you a prize ?
oh that 's what i thought . does she wear a college car ?
does he often come home ?
i m sure you do miss that type of cooking . but can t you try to get used to western food ?
i have tried . but americans like butter bread sugar and cream too much .
i suppose you re right lee . maybe that s why so many westerners are overweight .
it s interesting that americans work very hard at their jobs do not take naps during the day and yet they can be so heavy .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too much fast food and that food is very fattening .
why don t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy being outside working during the day ?
what do you suggest ? i can t afford to quit my job until i get a new one .
maybe you have two choices . you could attend school during the day or you could get a position that provides training .
really it 's so beautiful .
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
you must n't pick it in this place .
where it is ?
it is at the north of forbidden city on the central axis of beijing .
but how ?
yes i 'd like to have a look at the 2 piece suit .
yes of course . you can get it at the moment .
oh really ! i did n't know that .
it 's really a sad story . he likes to judge someone 's mother .
i bought it here three months ago .
what time do you want to go ?
no . don t bother .
thank you . do you want your money back or would you like to exchange it ?
i agree . we should n't have any animals here .
so you re smart .
i know you know i like the song .
i 'd be glad to .
honey you have n't had a chance to get away from me .
but you should make too much cheaper to stop smoking . otherwise it will be hard to keep up .
of course ! this is a really wonderful country .
mmm . . . i do n't think much of it . and it 's a good deal .
that s true . i wonder if i could help .
do you want a window seat or an aisle seat ?
it s a beautiful day isn t it ?
i do n't know . well my contract here is for one year and i do n't know what i should do after that . maybe going around for a while .
well have you ever thought about learning some chinese ?
actually i am learning that now . but it 's too hard for me . you know the four tones and the stuff . it really <unk> me out .
do n't worry . all things are difficult before they are easy .
you hit the nail right on the head .
well are you invested in some program ?
what is it ?
it 's a taiwanese doll .
awesome . i 've been giving this a lot of thought . when can we do this ?
how about this sunday ?
yes sunday sounds fine .
good . i 'll give you a call tonight .
no problem .
i might need some tools though . do you know where i can get some ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
i am not in the mood .
why are you feeling depress ?
i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . it 's a real letdown .
i do n't think she would do such a thing .
but she did and it made me disappointed .
oh cheer up . a girlfriend is not everything .
but she means a lot to me .
then forgive her mistake .
oh . i just can t forget it .
have you learned anything from america ?
yeah . and i took many pictures of the net . you know how to use it .
it 's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances .
you 're right .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
yes i like it very much .
what 's your favorite band ?
no it 's not your birthday today .
that 's horrible . i 'd better go home .
sorry . i must have made a mistake .
perhaps you 'd like to take a beautiful limousine .
really ? but you 're doing the tango wonderfully well .
yes in the middle of this weather should be thick enough to stop the music .
i hope i can make a decision .
have you ever heard about our special promotion ?
are you ?
yes but my english is very good . i often talk to my parents in english quite often .
me too . i 'm really tired .
i 'm afraid i do n't like the way that they were made .
then you will love the beautiful clean air .
dad it 's great to hear .
i hope you 're happy .
could you tell me something about your family ?
i can think of anything for the chance .
is n't that great ? tomorrow is green .
you 're right . but i like vegetables very much .
just a beer please .
okay i 'll have to weigh it first . do you have the receipt ?
ok . what about the steak ?
this is delicious . i would like it .
i am sorry too . i know we 've been talking about this beach trip for a while . i should have told bob i was busy this weekend .
how did you feel about the pay ?
thanks for understanding .
well that 's what being friends is about is n't it ?
hey what if the three of us go to the beach together ? besides you and bob have n't seen each other for a while . i do n't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers .
nah i would n't worry about that . but i do n't want to be the third wheel . you two should have some quiet time to yourselves .
the other time i know what you mean . i 'll make a note of it .
maybe . . . i 'll think about it .
well last night i had a big argument with ann .
it must be something serious . you two are such close friends .
now that i look back at it it was n't that big a deal . i should n't have lost my temper .
really ? what happened ?
i was denied a visa ?
that 's pretty harsh .
i know but i was so upset . i mean come on ! does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ?
you know she probably feels just as bad .
well i think i was being a little selfish myself . i know they do n't get to see each other very often .
well in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding . you should n't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . after all you can go to the beach anytime you want .
yeah i 'll call later to patch things up .
that 's very kind of you to say so . let 's try some <unk> wines .
great . sweet wines are my favorite . they always make a great finish to a decisions meal .
do you prefer brandy or ports .
port please .
excellent choice . i love its smooth flavor .
the port is quite exquisite . it must have spent years aging in barrels . am i right ?
yes . you always have a good nose for wines .
next time we are about to dinner we should try some canadian ice wine .
oh what 's that ?
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
why not ? it sounds great .
ok here 's to your health .
thanks . cheers .
cheers .
i 'd love to but i 'm not sure if it 's going to be the same .
i 'll be there in front of you .
i 'm sorry but could you tell me what a problem i do for you ?
yes sir . we have your reservation . could you fill out these forms please ?
yes . i was charged by the american team .
why is he always so ?
i was the only person in my family reading it . everyone in my family just likes to read fashion .
sounds like you did n't do anything .
yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that .
what does the <unk> mean by offering them ?
and his story did not even hold together .
that s true . he ran for office quite a few times before he was finally elected .
i 'm sorry . i thought you were taking a wrong turn .
if you think it is good i 'll give you a ride .
and what did he do ?
what s wrong ? that was a great goal .
yes but i bet 200 dollars on the cougars !
looks like you re going to lose out on this game then .
i can t believe it ! i thought the cougars were going to win for sure .
what were the odds ?
almost zero .
too bad .
what is it ? what happened ?
i think someone is stalking me .
no it ca n't be . really ? who ?
i do n't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking but staring . he just kept staring at me . he did n't stop .
what did you do ?
i talked to her for a while but she s really depressed . so i made an appointment with the school counselor for her .
did he leave when you left ?
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .
what did you do ?
that 's about five blocks . and around corners too . so he was definitely following you .
yes he was . i 'm not imagining it . finally just when i got home i turned around and looked at him . he was just standing there . he did n't smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious . what should i do ? i 'm so scared . can i call the police ?
actually i do n't think you can call the police . not yet at least . he has n't done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it . but if anything happens again then maybe you should call .
why ca n't i call the police now ? he was definitely following me !
of course you can call the police if you want . that 's not what i mean . i 'm just saying that they probably wo n't do anything .
i suppose . what can they do ? i do n't even know who he is .
listen carol . do n't let this bother you too much . probably it 's nothing . just keep your eyes open when you go out . if you see him a third time and if he follows you again then i think we should go to the police . but for now just try not to worry .
alright . and i wo n't go to that cafe for awhile .
more or less . there 's just one thing bothering me .
oh ? what 's that ?
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
what gift ?
it 's an egyptian carpet . the student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . seeing what gift was i was really uncomfortable . i mean it 's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . i do n't think i 've done anything to
you refused the gift ? that 's terrible .
i know but i really ca n't accept such an expensive gift . i explained to him why but he seemed really upset about it . i think he might have taken it the wrong way .
perhaps . he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
that 's what i am worried about . i do understand the respect attached with the gift and i am honored . but i really do n't think it 's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . i think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
can you tell me how to get to the jade buddha temple ?
i do n't think so . it 's about time to go to see a doctor .
i suppose you should prepare it .
i suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of the station .
what do they say ?
i do n't like your fishing very much . you really like going out and i 'd like to go out and have a taste .
oh do n't you know how to get there ?
i needed to look after my bedroom .
what are the different from the king 's offices ?
the weather report says ten to 8 .
really ? why did you do that ?
i was denied a visa ?
oh that 's very convenient . do you have the new service in china ?
i am very sorry . can you give me a receipt ?
it 's not bad . probably the economy is a big enough for everyone .
oh you don t know how to eat there ? you can have a place in the neighborhood .
well it 's a little late . i think we should get to the city soon .
why do you have all the choices ?
let me see . you have room number 6 p . m . and the number is 6 p . m . there is a grocery store just around the corner .
i got a job offer from dell .
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . .
a place in south of the city is a mustsee . this zoo was built in and it 's the biggest fun of the world . there are other tourists in your country .
oh my god . i think it was better than the chinese mountain .
it was really nice talking to you also .
we will sir .
yes . i heard it was a heavy storm . it was taken just a couple of hours ago .
yes i was . i sent that to you one on the spot . but i was so nervous that i forgot my phone . i 'm afraid it was too late to tell them .
we 're little late . i think we had better look at the traffic . it 's a nice traffic jam .
my birthday comes next month . i want to hold a birthday party too .
that s a good idea . it has been there for many years . and we have n't done that for a long time .
then i came back here . i worked for about three years to get some experience .
nice . hey do you want to come and have a look ? my name 's your car .
yes . you are right .
yes .
i 'm leaving on sunday . i just moved to canada and bought a new place .
are you planning on doing that ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
to agreement with you what kind of entertainment are you interested in ?
i always have trouble with my work .
i see . how much are you going to pay for ?
how much do are you looking to spend ?
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
what does that mean ?
i see . so let 's go .
i like to talk to you about that .
hello steven .
i 'm greg wu head of consultancy . i see that you 'd like a credit check done for your company . is that right ?
no . it was nothing .
but that 's not all . you 'd better take it easy .
yeah . i know .
yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that .
yeah .
well i would say that i m just drifting here in the pool .
but you two used to do everything together . i thought you really enjoyed each other 's company .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
have you thought about graduate school ?
i graduated from the beijing foreign studies university . my major is english for me .
what about his hair ?
you got me .
now listen ben . look i think it s a very good thing that a young man after he s done some very good work should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself and drink beer and so on . but after a few weeks i believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his
i 'm afraid not .
i have a taste of chinese food .
that 's good to hear . let 's go to the movies .
oh i 'm afraid i ca n't go to the gym .
pretty good sam . only the awful weather you know .
that s right . i ve never really liked it since i got here .
me either but i m dealing with it anyway .
well i ve got some papers due .
really ? so what s the news ?
not too good yet . better than i was though .
are you crazy ? the papers make everybody <unk> . i do n't think you are the exception
he 's from a professional movie last week .
what time do you expect him back ?
yes of course it 's not what i meant . i always don t want to be able to tell him .
i ca n't believe it .
it 's thursday i think .
it 's too bad . let 's go in to see him .
well the police officer says the lock behind the door . they should have been killed .
yeah it did n't happen all the time .
nothing much . i m going to the cinema on friday night but that s all i have planned .
i like listening to the classical music .
so is it delicious ?
no . they are too scared to grow up my mind .
oh good ! i have never been there !
i 've never heard of his book before . would you like to go ?
then you must be careful .
sure . it 's one of the biggest classical music events . have you ever been to the live show ?
of course i know . but i do n't know how to play well .
let 's see . oh the dance room is next to the famous band .
that 's for sure . you know i had the greatest time ever .
what was the score ?
oh speaking of the conductor he is indeed a genius . he did a perfect job . his name is menuhin a descendent of russian american immigrants .
he said that he won t be in class !
but i ve always been to get up and get going . i hope i can have a good time .
oh you are right . i will go to the movies this afternoon .
depends .
i heard that . it 's about our new teacher .
i was denied a visa ?
a cell phone ?
sure . most facials start with a thorough cleaning . then we usually use a toner to the skin followed by exfoliation <unk> mask or that removes the dead that make the skin lock dull . after that you can either side of the skin .
the yellow rock and roll of fast building .
yes . the scenery there is so breathtaking
do you mind if i swim ?
the skin a cantonese food making and japanese arts .
i guess so . sometimes they don t have much time to watch after the show .
yes . it s very hot and warm .
well . i see .
you can put your eyes on the picnic table .
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
no . i only want the insurance one .
i 'm sorry i feel like sitting out on the grass .
when ?
i got a builtin <unk> screen 5 and i have to watch my weight .
you 'll have to turn it on .
it 's not the same . sometimes i like shopping .
sure . i would like to buy a new one .
yes of course . it is a <unk> .
well we have some handmade products . let me show you some .
where can i find one ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
what color are you going to ?
it does n't matter . i can go to the gym .
certainly not . the most important thing is that our company demand the employees receive the same expenses if they can accept the class .
i agree . and it 's very convenient .
another place you can get real insight is european papers . you can get them online .
you are right . i can learn a lot from it .
ok . this one is our most popular choice . it 's the latest product .
thank you . goodbye .
yes you can .
i agree .
yes i like collecting things .
i just like to sleep like a lazy cat .
they 're usually give me a discount of 5 .
really ? how did you get it ?
sometimes . i 'm scared of fun .
what a pity !
well the dorm 's not true . i am thinking of going to the bad summer . when i was at the university i did n't want to watch the news at all . and professor knows i will die in the exam .
it is such a nice place .
sure . what 's up ?
bye .
yeah . they 're quite different now . they turn the subject on her .
well it was her idea to have her in the situation .
yes it is . i hope it stays like this .
yes please . i 'm ready for the additional <unk> before the tour .
i do n't know . . . well i do n't know what to do now .
wow your roommates are cleaning the room .
yeah . i could n't wait to see the olympic games at the first time .
mmm how much did you get it ?
i 'm not really sure . i know you 're very interested in the film .
thanks for your visit .
you 're so lucky !
really ? you 're so lucky .
it 's a great idea .
he 's in the hospital resting . the doctor 's did n't give a clear answer .
just a minute please .
he knows a lot from his english .
oh i see .
b a s what would you do at the end of the interview ?
you got it . i can say the perfect match is very interesting .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
i 'm sorry to say that we have to let you go john .
how do you find studying a language on the internet ?
it bears a great many of advantages but also some weak points .
is it ? i 've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
for instance the mobile phone seriously the attention of people from work and study .
how can you tell me about this ?
actually it 's not the fault of the mobile phone . but people should have a proper attitude towards it . mobile phone is a tool serving people not the fetters restricting them .
but your salary must be high .
it is . they are not in the mood for me . i do n't feel so good about it .
you need to take a break maybe a vacation .
i wish i could but i 'm a little worried about the delay .
well it 's a little late .
i know . i 'll do it .
no problem miss .
yeah . water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues .
but what are the sources of water pollution ?
they could generally be divided into two categories direct and indirect contaminant sources .
what about the water pollution ?
of course ! i have made an eye for you to choose .
but what about the indirect ones ?
indirect sources include that enter the water supply from or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater .
what other features are there on the work ?
sure . it 's an issue asking for everyone 's participation .
okay let 's call it a day .
but i work hard all the time for long hours .
politics can be an expensive hobby .
i was just robbed !
oh dear . did you get any honors or awards at your university ?
i had a bad dream . i was walking alone in the graveyard and suddenly all the ghosts jumped out of their graves . they began to chase me through the graveyard and shouted that they wanted my blood .
which is better ?
senior account rep .
i know . he doesn t have a yet but i m not sure . he doesn t look like you know what veronica i think you should do .
i 'm working under pressure .
when can you start with the new job ?
oh yeah . i just hope it wo n't happen again .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
how do you feel about having these days ?
is that why many people think it is so ? when are they online ?
how could you be so sure ? i do n't like it .
of course it does . the most important thing to be there is to be a lot of people who do n't care about the weather . it is about time to stop .
fine i 'll be expecting you .
let me see . how about 630 ?
when did you say ?
ok . well thank you for your help . have a great day !
see you .
it 's not too far away . it 's not my taste .
i 'll ask the man . he 's probably knows . is there some way you can do it ?
really ? what can i do ?
well let 's try to buy some things for the environment .
i 'll have to write you a ticket and suspend your driver 's license for 3 months .
i 'll have to think about it . oh no !
good afternoon ! sit down please . how are you ?
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
i 'm sorry . you know we are so busy today and we forget to sew the button back on . please wait a moment . it will be ready soon .
you 're from china .
yes it is . i 'm going to new york .
ok i will begin to work with you .
ok . i 'll give it to you right now . then we can call if we have to cancel it .
a korean film called friends starring sang .
what 's the weather like in the winter ?
how did you like the movie ?
i thought it was pretty good .
really ? i ca n't say i agree .
is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ?
how many times do you think ?
i guess it could happen .
is this a good thing for you to buy it for me ?
i will . thank you for your help .
oh come on . tell me what you eat .
i can so that .
you are right . we will talk about it next time .

do you have your card ?
yes we have tickets for ten . would you like to reserve a private room ?
of course ! what time ?
yes they 're fine .
good luck .
my name is paul .
sure it is . it 's 9
well the products in themselves are very simple . it is the logo that is successful . so hello kitty is successful because of the logo but the products are very simple .
yes . and also the main academic aspect is both the advantage of you want to put yourself in the interview .
i have heard that so . we have thought that you would have done a lot of business in this unit .
i know . you re right .
where is the weather where it is ?
why is that ?
we should do this more often .
seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? that 's a good idea . let 's go !
wait a minute . let me throw on a sweater .
take care ! do n't slip down to the ground .
i 've got it . i like the sound of stepping on the snow very much .
yes . very high .
do you smell the sweet scent ?
how big was it ?
he sure is .
okay . . . i was just calling about the team of the universe .
sure . what 's the program ?
yes i would have fun if i were you i would n't go so well .
i see . well you 're probably right . the train leaves on the bus is always open . and you should n't go to the nearby .
do you know when he comes here ?
i remember last time . he was white and i remember to pull a pair of shoes .
my friends and i just got back from bali .
did you have some sunscreen before you go to the beach trip ?
yeah my friend and i go swimming too .
what a horrible goal ! that 's not like a cut !
oh that 's not the same . i never thought it would be a good thing to get another place for you .
neither . the game ended in two all .
but i still think ac milan's defence seems better organized .
but the brazilian is tougher .
glad you like it . it 's really beautiful .
he is in his late thirties .
what 's the average temperature ?
i know . i want to try it on .
yes . i think the weather is so changeable in the summer .
is there a swimming in the apartment ?
i think so . take it easy . it 's just a drop in the bucket . that car has made deep breath .
very good idea . sometimes such pictures can show the house 's richness .
see that 's definitely true . and probably the whole thing is that i did n't see any of them !
i love it . it 's a pity i have to learn some golf .
is what you said as far as you know about city ?
sports .
that s a good idea . but i can t find any money for you .
you are deadly right .
i like to play golf play badminton or crack jokes .
do you like playing the chess ?
yes i like playing basketball . i 'm an american team player .
yes but it 's fun .
that would be lovely .
not much . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .
is that right ? what 's this guy like ? is he hot ?
well i <unk> n't think so at first . but as we started talking i found him extremely funny and witty . i could n't stop laughing at his jokes ! we have so much in common . we like the same teams music a
it seems you two are a good match . what qualities do you look for in a friend ?
there 's nothing definite i think . i do n't have a list or anything but when i first meet somebody i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have a radar helping me spot new friends .
well that 's something i 've never heard of . but if you as me what i value most in a friend i would have to say honesty .
i agree . you ca n't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .
yeah i know . a friend in need is a friend indeed . i do n't need fairweather friends either .
i like playing chess .
you can play classical music well . it is said that they do much better than free talk to people .
i like all kinds of music . but i like country music best .
oh it 's really beautiful . i 'll take it .
yes . playing chess is a very aggressive experience . all the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . whenever i start a chess game i ca n't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all stand ready to kill .
do you still like playing those games ?
it 's not worth it . for me who can buy some stuff online .
i like the plot . it 's full of twists and turns . i also like the main character . she is so humorous and smart .
that 's great . well we can talk about the meeting . it is really a nice day .
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .
oh it 's love at first sight . when will you see each other again ?
he did n't say but he said he would call me .
maybe he is busy with his work . just wait and try not to think about it too much !
oh steve . stop it ! i am a bit nervous ! what if he does n't call ?
come on mary you 're a total catch . i bet he will call you . do n't worry .
thank you steve . you 're always so encouraging .
that 's what friends are for .
thank you for your kindness . but i think i 'll come to your house soon .
this is a good idea . we just need a few more questions for you . that 'll be a bit nervous .
it 's me . she is my sixth husband .
yes is she ?
let 's go to the theater and buy two tickets now shall we ?
i do n't know . maybe we can find the way to make it .
what are you talking about ?
yes . i like the novels of dickens very much . i 've read about the latest novels of a product that is very good .
what kind of tools ?
then you should do the <unk> .
i learned in college . when i was little we met at the university in china i started to learn it .
we can always get a look at our favorite band .
well i do n't have a very big problem with my office .
i 'm in the suburbs .
it s a nice place to live .
ok .
here you go .
it is . hurry up !
i know . i know . and i know she looks very young .
i really do n't think they 'll have had their act together .
yes i like the bamboo design . what do you think ?
i 'm going to the gym .
i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
i 'm sure you 'll look grand when it 's done . would you like to have a shampoo after a while ?
and i ca n't have done that .
i 'm afraid not . the tour bus will have to take us out to clean up .
yeah ? what does that mean ?
what do you want me to do ?
good . put on your cape we are going to take the children .
oh steve . stop here ! come on !
i m fine . how are you ?
yes i 'll see you after your high school .
yes . i 've been given a lot of time .
i 'll have to write you a ticket and suspend your driver 's license for 3 months .
what about the one ? she was just the two .
i have to write you a ticket and suspend your driver 's license for 3 years .
i think you 're making a fuss . the concert is back on .
thank you very much .
the competition is so nice . you know how hard it is to make this year ?
no . we had to get a new line .
he 's got a promotion .
that must be a deadly risky business . do you know why he has such a huge trick ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted at me .
what happened ?
he 's just a member of the bank .
good . i was thinking that i d like to invite you to watch a movie . i can meet you at the cinema gate .
it 's a great game for a man who never looked like .
that 's ok . he 's just got in a hurry .
he must be lonely ?
i 'll be back in a sec .
because you d end up spoiled rotten if i wasn t .
yes i was just thinking of walking around the mall . i found it a bit more difficult .
i see .
did you see the results ?
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
they did n't say .
i was denied a visa ?
then he is really lucky .
it sounds interesting but i can t find the way to get the city .
i did n't know what you mean .
how long is it gonna take ?
maybe you 're right . but it 's still too hard for me .
not bad .
really ?
yes . is that so important ?
that 's a good idea . i 'll have to call him now .
have you seen the samples ?
and i love going to work at the weekend .
we 've got 6 of boxes for camping and we have n't done much in our house yet .
yeah the people don t really like that . we should look at big tree outside and there . is the view from the park ?
i do n't know . it seems that there is always a bad point in making a new friends .
what happened ?
i do n't know . i just got a message from my computer and i 'm sick .
fruit juice ? what about some other cold dishes ?
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for a full hour in the cold wind .
are you serious ?
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
yes that 's right . i guess i 'll go to his home after work .
i talked to her for a while but she s really depressed . so i made an appointment with the school counselor for her .
it 's a camera .
i m a senior production planner here in the company . i do n't know what to do with them .
where did they see ?
you know i often overhear our neighbor the young couple fighting about how to raise their kid and i really do n't want kids to spoil our happiness .
well . i 'll have to call you back later .
do you know if she 's read this one ?
welcome to the apartment . and what do you need to go to the hotel ?
no i 'm sure i 'll get better soon .
my name is bill .
excuse me ? i do n't think you can make it .
oh shut up ! you know we just got married .
it 's half past seven .
oh that 's all right . where is it ?
i know . i just saw the reason in the paper this morning .
where are you coming from ?
i am going to clean it up . i have to move it now .
that 's a good idea . you 'll be better in a couple of minutes .
i 'm afraid i have to leave .
where can i help you ?
no i 'm not sure if i can .
of course i do . i feel like an outdoor person .
see you .
i 'm sorry but i ordered sole not the same as the others . will you change it ?
i 'll have to cancel the trip .
i really appreciate the offer but i must decline it .
they always make a lot of effort .
how about the umbrella ? it 's really nice .
you should hand it in before next sunday .
it s all right . where are you going ?
oh dear ! did you call for a friend ?
no the other one will be perfect .
so i do n't know . . . well it 's a chinese restaurant . i 'm a little worried .
you re in america now my british friend . we just call it football .
oh right . so i can t quite follow what s going on . . . who s winning ?
the giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked but the have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone .
wow ! what a hit !
yeah he tackled him so hard his helmet came off .
is he ok ?
it looks like it he s getting up .
i guess he hit him too hard the just called a penalty on the home team .
the giants ?
yeah .
why do n't you speak english ?
what happened ? why did everyone get so quiet ?
the s just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . we re losing again .
yeah i just got them . i started playing ice hockey in a community league . so i finally got myself new skates .

the rockets .
really ? i think we play you guys next week . well i have to go to practice . see you later .
i 'll definitely try to .
we are going to climb a cliff on the colorado river .
how hard is the climb ?
it is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .
what did you do last week ?
we rappelled down the side of 300 foot cliff . it was very exciting .
wow . that sounds like a lot of fun . i m sorry i missed it .
well you should come this weekend . i think you could do the climb .
yeah i will . see you then !
o . k . see you .
i 'm just watching some television .
i 'm so bored . i do n't know what i 'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning .
me too . do you think we are boring people ?
i do n't think we are boring . it 's just that we do n't have any hobbies .
that 's right . what do you think we should do as a hobby ?
that all depends on what you like to do . for example i like to doodle on the notepad so i 'm thinking about doing some real drawings .
i like to play the piano for fun .
yes you play the piano well . you could be a good pianist . that 's good .
hobbies are never too late to learn . they offer a variety of classes at the local community college . you should look into it .
yes . do you like reading books ?
we had a fantastic time .
that must have been wonderful . do anything interesting ?
well . we went bungee jumping when we were in malaysia .
wow ! isn t that dangerous ?
a little but the rush was worth it .
tell me about it .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
500 feet ! i would never be able to do that .
yeah it was scary but exhilarating .
really ? where does that mean ?
yes he is . he loves the girl very much .
no but i 'll soon be depressed .
yes . you know digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry and they wo n't cost you too much .
<unk> .
yeah i like it but it is too expensive .
well i guess it was around something . they should have their mind .
got it . thank you for reminding me .
i 'm sure it is .
how do you know the dollar line ? are you aware of the slow direction of the city ?
wow that 's a good idea . but you did a good job .
i hope so . thank you .
please give me a few days and we can have a good time .
yes . the palace hotel .
that 's wonderful . we have always been there .
they are behind the door .
how about a public place ?
oh they are all waiting for their .

i like it . it 's so beautiful .
i will be getting a .
i know but it 's hard for me to forget . then i wo n't take the trip .
they must have been amazing .
wow . sounds fantastic !
a trip could be a zoo !
why not ?
certainly . for example the insurance company will have to stay in for two years .
wow ! how highclass . . . a new pair for each day . .
that 's a great idea !
wow ! they 're great !
to be honest i d really like to go for a trip with us .
well let me have a look at you . you 'll have a deal .
maybe . i think that many physicians now agree with that idea .
how long is the duration of applying for our investors ?
do you want to come in ?
yes i think so .
really ? i did n't expect that .
hmm . i 'll be there around 6 .
i see . what 's the fare ?
that 's why people 's car is so noisy . i never know who he was .
i see . do you know anyone who has done that before ?

yes . we can make some arrangement if you like . the traffic is very heavy . is it the rush hour ?
all right . the coach leaves at the moment . that 's all the news . the major magazine says that the teachers will be closed to two hours .

for protection . some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air .
so there is n't air in the glass boxes ?
no there is n't . they are all vacuumed .
you mean i should n't have told you . it 's a good thing .
yeah you know all about it .
hey look at the threeleg cup . i 've seen it on tv .
i see . all carryon items must be able to fit under the seat or in the overhead bin .
i m sure .
i will . i m sure it will .

wow that would be a lot of fun .
how do you want to be your girlfriend ? she 's married .

no problem . i 'll do it right now .
i might need some tools though . do you know where i can get some ?
i 'll give you the time .
i do n't know . i am sure the idea of making a decision . it 's difficult for me to get used to such a <unk> .
i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . jones needs a telephone call from you .
i 'm afraid the price is too high to us . we 'll have to discuss it with you tomorrow .
we have a great deal . we offer a lot of services . we have ten different kinds of services .
is the pay a lot ?
yes it is . it 's also a piece of cake .
do you think you can tell me something about the author 's life ?
it could also help you increase vital capacity .
ok i see . thanks for your help .
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
can i go in to have a look at it now ?
some of my friends may have a visit to america .
you said it . i m getting a little late . i can t do anything right now .

yes . i have a computer program that is much more than i had expected .
i 'm not sure . it could be the tires . let 's stop here .
i have a internet that is really cool . i should say it 's easy to do the internet in a library .
i think that the government will provide you with all of that needs training .
yes but i 'd like to see any black tea .
which is that ?
yes .
how about going there to have a look now ?
what 's wrong ? it 's a bit early .
oh that 's easy for me . i 've never seen such a good deal .
i am getting a little excited about the family .
should i be able to use the internet ?
in my opinion the government is reluctant to answer any <unk> .
you know sometimes i 'm trying to raise money for the kids in the community .
that 's wonderful !
i think i 've caught a cold .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . you can go on a holiday to cheer you up .
no but i ended up finding out later that night when i saw her with another man at a club near my home .
what did you do ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
you guessed right . she used to be on the date and everyone around the world .
yeah you are right . i can stand still there .
yes i have been in the u . s . dollars in total .

i m studying in the law school .

i hope so . i 'm sure it will get better in shape .
my pleasure . i suppose you dance often .
you must n't dance well .
it 's ok . i can teach you how to play .
yes . the language is hard to learn but it 's interesting .
i think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than atm processing speed .
take some medicine and stay in bed for a day or two .
listen it is waltz . i like the elegant step of the old styles .
yes i like the old style dance such as waltz rumba and so on . they are quite graceful .
i 'm glad you like them . . . .
you 've got it .
i hate to have a radio game but it 's not good for me to do some exercise .
it 's a fruit with a bottle of champagne .
no . but i 'd like to stay at home .
would you like to play tennis with me ?
yes i do . i like playing chess .
no i do n't . but it 's too professional .
good idea !

i 'm afraid not . i just keep hoping that the guy is always on the way to my feet .
he is in a perfect mood . can you give me a call tomorrow ?
she s going to be a pretty woman .
i know . i know .
yes of course . i ca n't go through a day without coffee in the morning .
well it 's a little bit expensive . you can get a cab and make up . it 's not that simple .
well have you ever heard of oulong tea and compressed tea ?
what is it ?
you know what ? i mean . i 've seen you five years ago .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
yes . love me .
and do n't ever forget it .
you ca n't say that !
you can see the results with the increase . and i also have to contribute to the equal rights .
i appreciate your effort very much . good luck !
i 'm so lucky .
that 's a great idea . we have a the kitchen god is very famous .
you 're right . ok . but i 'll change it up .
let 's just say that the roller coaster looks more fun .
ok . if you want to love me it 's a <unk> outside the window .
but i like the feeling . it might be so boring .
you have a good seat . how would you like to be in your life ?
okay that 's good .
i think i will try it on .
you should probably take two weeks off .
i do n't know .
that sounds a good idea .
well done !
thanks . could you tell me where i am going ?
yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that .
that s great . we ll send him a squad car shortly .
oh !
well i came to know a girl three weeks ago . we have so much in common .
just asking ? but why is your face burning like mad ? ahhuh someone has a crush on jenny does n't he ?
i do n't know .
come on ted ! do n't be such a chicken . if you like her you 've got to tell her . maybe she likes you .
i do n't know . . . well maybe we 'll be talking about her .
but that 's better than keeping everything to yourself . you 've got to let her know . come on ! you 've got to take a chance ! even though you are rejected it 's not the end of the world ! there 's nothing to lose is there ?
it is .
it 's so quiet . i love you so much . thank you for your help .
you 're right . i just wanted to say goodbye to you !
you 're right . it 's a pity that i do n't go to the same thing .
i know ! it 's a new song that is very popular among chinese people .
he has the same opinion .
what 's the reason for her ?
i had a few friends . they are a lovely wedding but they are so beautiful .
ok .
i 'm not a very good singer . let 's go to the dance floor .
i 'm having a really bad weekend . i 'm having trouble taking a class next week .
how about rock 'n'roll ?
not at all . the really is that the window is n't it ?
i 'd like to meet the generally wellknown spots .
i have not heard of that . it s called the china s government . it s an interesting way to spend the money there .
are you sure ?
how about the cinema ?
ok . i have been looking forward to it .
sure . i 'll be glad to see you .
the bigger is the harder they fall .
right here .
they look delicious . they have a sweet tooth .
i think it 's a great birthday present for you !
i have no idea . i think we will be happy about it . the best for you is to get married .
yes he is . but he has an amazing ability to learn .
yes she is .
why do you choose our company ?
will you say it again ?
why ? you mean that she was such a famous girl .
but i like wearing tshirts and jeans .
i guess you 're right . but what 's your hair like ?
what 's the notice ?
well she 's pretty but i heard it 's pretty .
but i do n't like beer . i 'm sure they get enough sleep .
that is a wonderful idea . how is it ?
you are welcome . please let me ask if you have any questions .
thank you very much .
not much . what 's up ?
i 'm having a party this friday .
ok . i will go and have a good time .
yes . i 'm still hungry but i 'm still waiting for my invitation .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
i see . then do you have any hobbies ?
we can go to the stone park .
ok .
i 'll pick you up at your hotel at eight in the morning .
ok .
thank you . i want to change the date .
you 're welcome . and please call if you have any questions .
i 'll go and get that .
ca n't i help you ?
thanks . stop here now . let 's go to the hotel .
i really appreciate the help .
excuse me miss . can you show me where i can find it ?
goodbye !
sure . have you got anywhere in mind ?
i 'm starving so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .
that italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . do you want to go there ?
i 'm not really in the mood for italian actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy .
if you want spicy food then i 'd recommend going to a thai indian or chinese restaurant . how about that chinese buffet on <unk> road ?
i really like that restaurant you get a lot for your money there . but they 've westernized their food so it 's not actually that spicy .
you 're right . most of their dishes have sweet sauces . we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us .
the taj ? they 're a bit expensive but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
the taj it is then .
shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
they 'll still charge us a corkage fee .
that 's right . it 'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .
do n't worry about money . i 'll treat you tonight .
are you sure ? we could go dutch .
no i 'll pay . it 's my turn anyway . you paid last time .
i wo n't argue with that ! let 's go !
have fun . get out of the city and we 'll have a day off .
oh i do n't know . i do n't know what kind of fish she likes .
it 's pretty far away . but i 'm going to miss the news .
do n't render me lipservice you 'd better stay at home tonight .
they are the most wonderful dishes for you .
happy birthday george . many happy returns of the day . here we go .
thank you .
nothing special . i 've been looking forward to seeing you again .
really ? i ca n't wait to hear that . it 's the first time i 've been there .
the same to you !
the same to you !
it was nice to see you too . i really enjoyed our offer .
i just got back from london .
is that right ?
i had a good time . you seem to be in a hurry . do n't let me hold you up .
fantastic ! i got an overall experience .
come on ! rest breads .
i really want to obtain a permanent job . i wo n't leave as long as i have opportunity to apply my knowledge and get on well with my superiors and colleagues .
and he s bright and intelligent .
he is in his late thirties .
but i don t know how it is . it s a little late . i ve got to get a film for me .
no this is 2517759 .
that 's great . congratulations .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
he prefers suits to jackets .
judge from his look he 's a very serious person .
as a matter of fact he is .
do n't believe him . he 's a liar .
we cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth .
she 's very nice .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
they have moved to chicago .
do you have a reservation ?
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
we can only spend 300 a month .
that 's correct . could you give me some more details about it ?
well i 'm not sure . let 's go to the mall . i 'm having a car .
that 's fine . we can do that today .
i know . it 's really nice to meet you .
let 's go for the dog .
i 'm sorry we ca n't now . please hold on .
i 'd like to get a ticket to new york . i think i might be able to travel very much .
well that sounds good to me . how many places do you have ?
i 'm going to new york .
why not come and visit us ?
is there an additional surcharge for the taiwanese guests ?
it 's 3 . 30 days a day .
where are you going now ?
we should be careful the traffic is not heavy on the way .
thanks to you for being so excited .
no i have n't . i 've only seen one in my life . i was n't sure it was the one with the judge from the book .
star war .
what 's the film ?
good afternoon ! sit down please . how are you ?
i 'm very well thank you . how are you ?
very well too thank you very much . isn t it a lovely day ?
yes it 's beautiful but it 's also very hot .
yes .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
where do you live ?
i live in beijing .
here . near this school .
i m very well thank you for coming . how are you ?
oh i see . how is everything ?
how about next time we meet at my place ? and i ll treat you to chinese food . i know how much you like it . we can order in and watch video too . anything you like i promise .
good see you !
i like spring .
how about summer ?
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
i like spring too . we can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air .
i was denied a visa ?
i 've heard that when this happens it 's important to save energy .
i really feel so good .
no . we do n't have any hobbies .
they 're a little beautiful digital barbie .
we 'd better go out for a walk .
ok . let 's go .
i like spring .
how about summer ?
i dislike it most .
you have been in line for a time now . do you have anything on the right ?
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
but sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
what time is the flight ?
i really hate this weather .
cool fellow what 's the date today buddy ?
it 's . . . oh it 's the 1st april fool 's day .
you forgot all of about it did n't you ?
on 20th may 1963 .
do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ?
27th day of the fourth month .
by the way could you tell me when the film will begin ?
it will begin at five thirty .
can you make it a little cheaper ?
what 's your excuse this time ?
i do n't want to miss it today .
oh my god . i think it was better than the chinese mountain .
what did the score say ?
we will sir .
i heard that it was a new job .
yes . it was a very hot game and the garden . i gave them a really funny .
we 're little late . i think we had better look at the traffic . it 's totally rush hour .
i fell down . i took a while and then i turned around i was walking around a bit slow . but i just did n't want to forget which is that i should bring a stop ?
do n't you think it 's a nice summer ?
yes . you are right .
me too . recently i 've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them .
do you think it 's a sheer waste of both time and money ?
i 'm afraid not . to me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
yes of course . what time are you ?
i think we should go and see a thai massage .
let 's see . the label says it 's as beautiful as the flowers here .
when did you start worrying about your weight ?
crazy !
yeah . that 's a good idea . i can easily do the color <unk> around the corner .
i 'm just too interested in doing something .
how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look ? i remember there is one in the gym .
i was thinking of buying some gifts for the family .
me too . what did you have in mind ?
i have n't decided yet but i think the olympic mascots are a must .
i agree . they 're very lovely especially huan huan .
well you can say that again .
the five dolls are sold together as a set and they 're priced according to the size . the bigger they are the more expensive .
oh i see . if i buy more than a set can i get any discount ?
i do n't think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now .
how about the olympic park ? they 're really popular now .
there are lots of things such as postcards key chains posters and various arts and crafts .
it all sounds great . we can go there after the match . i ca n't wait to see what they have .
it s a lot harder than i imagined . there are many things to do with the funeral home but i still have a lot of things to do .
would you like to go with me ?
not really . but i like it very much . i was looking under the weather sometimes . the weather there were not hot . the weather is hot and sunny .
oh it 's a beautiful city . i really like rainy days .
that would be too much but i do n't think it 's too safe for us to pay .
but that 's better than the bus .
about 30 people .
not bad . i can take them out of the question .
and the hijackers did n't have any children ?
yes . but we re so right for each other .
i bought you a new one last year . is it handsome ?
i see . i 'd like to see some of them .
no i have n't . i like it very much .
that sounds good . what about your family ?
yes . . .
well . you d better go to the movies .
no i haven t . i m sure if i can afford it .
yes . i have . there are a lot of golf on the internet .
i bet you had a good taste .
it was n't too bad it was n't too bad .
i like the sight .
how much money are you looking to do ?
there s no catch !
i just lost my job .
that s all right . we have to go to the beach tomorrow .
i m sorry .
oh dear . i m sorry to hear that . is it still under the name of the phone ?
yes but we should be careful .
oh you like it . you know it 's a good movie . you just ca n't change it .
would you like it to be the first time i was in the sales department ?
it s a family . he s always banging the drum for better schools .
i m so jealous . i ve never been to the company for a few years .
good . where did you get your job ?
yes they were horrible . we had to get a storm with our boss last month . it s an hour now .
i just lost my job . i found a terrible job in the office .
have you had any head injuries lately ?
no . i m sorry to hear that . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
yes they do . in fact they only had a few days of sick days .
i must have slept right through it .
i did n't know you liked her .
i remember you are in love .
oh i took a shine to him when we met for the first time . but it comes and goes .
it 's greek to me .
so the reform can not be carried out well .
the government is making efforts to change situation .
you re right .
he is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
what ? it s only 9 p . m . now . why today he went to bed so early ?
he ran four miles and came back dead beat .
that 's too bad . what did he do ?
i 'm tired of your opinions . who do you think you are !
all right . have you ever heard of them ?
why not ?
i 'm sorry .
i have to file a report at the police station .
you are so thoughtful .
i feel the same way .
it must be dreadful to grow old .
yeah . he has no one to count on .
he is n't here . he 's not here very good .
what ?
john is in prison now . he was copped outstealing .
i just can n't believe my ears !
i ca n't deny that . she is so beautiful that i fell in love with her at the first sight . i wish i knew more about her .
but i heard that she had a threeyearold girl .
i can not belive that . it must be cooked up by someone .
of course i wo n't chill out . opportunity knocks only once .
you should strike while the iron is hot .
you 're right . i will have a talk to her about that .
really ? i thought he loved his wife very much .
yeah . but his relation with sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife .
he deserved it .

oh i 'm sorry . but could you tell me where the meeting is ?
then my son drove into a tree .
i was wondering if you could do it for me .
i 'm afraid not . he 's still here on the saturday . he 's going to leave me with the office on saturday and sunday .
the saturday is good for me . i 'm going to the party .
no . i 'm afraid not . my english is a little high .
why not ?
oh my poor danny sure you are a man . but you know running like this in street is very dangerous .
they can make you easier for yourself to stop drinking coffee ?
well maybe you can just say that . i 'm not so sure . but what i need is a shoe .
what does he look like ?
really ? that 's great !
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
is she old or young ?
you should get used to it .
i know you are a hundred percent student !
oh dear ! how about some other personal information ? are you sure you can ask me any time ?
come on baby . i do n't think he 's a little thing .
do n't you think he 'll be able to find a job ?
let me see . yes he has a registered then .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
yes . i will be glad to get all the things ready in a few days .
i 'm afraid i 'm going to be .
what 's wrong ?
but you could hit him .
that 's a good idea . i usually think about what you 're doing .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
yes they 'll soon stop and fix it .
would you like me to go with you ?
i 'd like to but i 'm tied up with my paper .
do you want to type that letter ?
i d rather you typed it .

i d rather you told her .
yes i 'm serious . i 'm really sorry about missing your concert .

yes let 's go .
oh dad i 'm not a child . i 'm 17 already . i 'll come back as soon as the film is over .
maybe that 's the best you can do .
i will . thank you dad .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do it again .
you see . when will it be here then ?
it 's not worth it . besides i really did n't have to lose this place .
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you them .
i did n't really like it .
mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
i found it very disappointing .
she liked the acting too because that 's what she wanted to see .
i was n't happy with it .
nothing is to your satisfaction .
never ! he s over 80 isn t he ?
he s nearly 90 .
i see . what else can i help you with ?
i am . whatsmore his wife is 84 .
is she really ?
yes she is . and guess what he is her sixth husband .

let 's enter it !
i ca n't open the door .
it must be locked .
let me ask the old woman in that reception office .
she ca n't answer you .
she must be deaf .
it must be a haunted house . are you frightened ?
frightened ? you must be joking .
oh thank you .
i see . it s always nice to see you again .
pleased to meet you too . let me help you with your bags .
i 'm coming for the job you 've advertised in yesterday 's newspaper .
thank you .
i 'll just have water .
glad to meet you mr . brown .
she s very well too helen . here is a present for you .
ok . we will have to discuss it with you .
and i hope you will enjoy our new meal .
hello jack . it 's mary . what are you doing in your office ?
i ve been working late .
how many weeks do you spend on your holiday ?
i 'd love to .
are you interested in doing research ?
sorry i never go out on saturday evening . i always watch football on saturday evening .
will you come round next tuesday ?
next tuesday ? just a moment ! it will be the 21st of may . oh dear . arm . . i promised my aunt i would be at her birthday party .
very good you have made an appointment with the owners right away .
let me see . yes mary . let 's make it next wednesday .
after the wedding ?
bye .
i m glad you like them .
ok . thank you .
that 's what i want .
it s a nice neighborhood .
you know me . i m from a chinese medicine . i won t be able to read it in the class .
i went to yale university .
what if you 're worried about money ?
i have a b . a . in economics .
would you mind telling me how old you are ?
i 'm twentyseven .
how about summer ?
yes i have worked in a bank for the last five years .
we have a lot of experience in this field .
i got 500 a week .
thank you . good evening mr . dean .
would you tell us your name please ?
i 'm helen baker .
glad to meet you ms . baker .
glad to meet you too .
where are you from ms . baker ?
i 'm from new zealand .
what do you do for a living ?
i manage one of the ski lodges . it s a great job i can spend a lot of my time outdoors and i also get to ski for free all season .
thank you for coming ms . baker .
what s she doing ?
you are booked on the on at <unk> pm to hong kong with cathy pacific .
yeah let 's do it .
yes . what 's on saturday ?
will the sixth of september .
well i hope to see you on friday then .
thank you . can i cancel my reservation ?
what happened ?
tomorrow ?
i can t make it for you . we ll come to the office .
i might be late for the party tomorrow night at seven .
that s for sure . i ll call you back later .
no i have n't but i 've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper .
what kind of job are you looking for ?
i 'm trying to find a job in sound engineering .
you have n't had any experience in either of those fields .
i know . but i 'd like to try . look here are some advertisements that i 've cut out .
i was turned down again . it s frustrating . i guess you ve got to teach me some skills .
me ? i m even less experienced than you are .
at least you know what american women generally like in a man .
believe it or not i guess american women like a man in good shape which chinese women may not care about so much . that s my honest opinion . i know you have been trying very hard .
american men are naturally taller than chinese men . so even if i exercise there aren t many chances .
no that s not true . i ve met two american women who were married to chinese . but those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is chan ? he s small and short . but i bet he can have any american woman he wants .
and how is your greatest weakness ?
why don t you try then ? even if it doesn t help you find an american girl you could still have a stronger and healthier body . you won t lose anything by doing that .
hi don . what a surprise !
yeah i saw someone walking like you but i wasn t sure . we haven t seen each other for how long ? almost three months ? but you look quite different now .
have you noticed what has changed ?
oh you look quite slender and more <unk> . what have you been taking ? are you on a diet ?
yes . i m on a diet but i ve not taken anything . i just eat less and exercise more . and it really worked in the past three months . i ve lost twelve pounds .
wow ! that s great . i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals but it s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . also you know old habits are hard to break .
what kind of exercise do you think i do ? i just go to dance everyday after work . i m taking an amateur dance class . i dance two hours everyday .
dance ? you only go dancing ? that s not hard . i can do that .
sure . join my class next week .
what is it ?
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
sure i have never been to recommend myself .
what about these shoes ?
we 're on the way out . we 'd better not have any .
ok . i 'll be right back .
are you a qualified teacher ?
you 're going to have a cold .
yes . i 'm sure i 'll be able to get a good job .
let 's try it .
i know you do n't want to be your own feelings .
yes but my wife won t allow me to buy it for a long time .
i see . well with this amount i can help you out . would that be possible to sign the bill ?
like what ? i think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction .
maybe . but i 'll have a little time .
yes . i 've been pretty busy .
i agree . you have to be making a good choice .
i know . i 'll just buy a new one .
but it ca n't be this . the sand storm is just a flight from the suburbs . it 's why the water 's been experiencing so much pain recently .
i 've noticed that . what can i do when the problem is that ?
why do n't you start with one of your friends ?
i do n't think anyone has their bad influence .
the meeting will give you the approval of your manager .
those are good add to the point . each of the stars should be an agreement . they should be credit .
oh i 'm just looking for a job .
i was just thinking about getting a bite to eat and do some catching up . do you want to come over and have a drink ?
i 'd love to but i 'm not sure it 's a formal party .
you 've got it . i 'll bet your mom and let you know .
it was a little special but i 've never had a part of it .
woo easy ! today we are going to have a special day to go .
i 'm not an outdoor person . i guess i 'll just keep going to an air on my own .
but the fish is so romantic .
yes the company will have a very formal experience and have a good time in the interview .
sounds like an interesting idea . you 're going to go with me .
that is true . the plants that fascinate me most are seen .
i saw her dating with her exboyfriend again . she is a nice girl and kind of cool right on the internet .
love me . you know we have to get them here for free .
what are you going to do ?
no not really .
yes i know . i should have been working there .
well i can t wait to see you . i m looking forward to seeing you in new york .
i 'm afraid i 'm very ill .
i know . it s just a waste of money .
well i would like to talk to you about the situation of the company .
one hundred and twenty dollars .
oh that 's too big . where are your kids ?
i don t think that is too much for rent .
oh . . . i guess i can give it to my boss .
i think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you .
ok . i will go there right now .
okay . i ll pick you up around 6
i see . are there any seats available ?
are you also interested in doing something ?
i have never been completely honest with you veronica i 'm sorry to hear that . i 'm sorry to hear that .
yeah . i was n't thinking about it .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
when can i start ?
well it 's a pleasure to talk with you .
no i 've been to china for years .
it 's a fruit which has been good in china .
i see . will his homework come with america too ?
i 'm impressed . what a superb amount of people in the world .
true . ok now i 'm going to the bank to take care of the things .
well i have to write the proposal . i 'm pretty excited about it .
how about <unk> temple fair ?
i think i can help you figure it out .
yes . the minutes i do n't know . the weather report on my first two days of job are much better than the sales staff . but i do n't know why i 'm always so busy .
so you 're sure we will come to an agreement on . tell me what you 're missing .
i was denied a visa ?
what should we do about it ?
they will . i 'll call you later .
and we have been in common with other people too . we ve always been together to have a good time .
of course . i spent so much time at my old workplace that i got to know them all very well . they were like family to me .
i eat more and more these days . and it puts even more weight on me .
i guess you are right . well i am not in the mood for it . shall we go to a chinese restaurant ?
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
excuse me for what .
thank you . here s a present for you .
that s very kind of you . i think the garden will soon get the grass .
it s amazing . they re not allowed in my apartment .
i think you re right . i got a fever but it s not all that i m sorry .
well you can t just take it . i guess i ll just put in a cab .
i don t want to be late . i m sorry . it s not something i can do .
oh no . we have n't had one for a while . we can go to the park park in the afternoon .
could you also give me a description of your shop ?
it 's a onebedroom apartment .
i 'll take it .
ok . i 'll put it in a piece of wood .
but that does n't really matter . the price is very cheap .
yes it is . we have several bedrooms in the living room and dining room .
is there any room for rent ?
right . we should really be ourselves .
i promise you 'll be in touch with the air .
have you thought about it ?
thank you .
it could be .
yeah you have some other ideas ?
i think in some way it is an act of god but in another way it just is caused by us .
what did the woman ask you ?
we did n't pay attention to the environment cut down trees and polluted the air .
oh i see . fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things .
really ? that 's a in the wind .
yes it 's one of the best choice .
yeah . they suit each other . a perfect match between a man and a girl .
it 's nice . let me have a look . yes you can ask the name of the person you want .
you 've had a good time . you have n't had much trouble .
you have to try your amenities .
i see . thank you for your advice .
what 's the matter with them ?
is there anything i should do ?
oh yes of course . i will .
what 's the problem ?
what do you mean by that ?
i think that 's just what i want . i 'd like to have it straight home .
is that spelt m a c or m c ?
i was in the bank at the time . they are taste differently .
really ? what 's he like ?
i think i might . i can understand why so many people come out and take a walk .
ok . i will take one .
that 's fate .
i feel sorry for her .
maybe this is god 's will .
we have two cleaning ladies . but both of them have received little education .
most cleaning ladies are illiterate . but some of them do a very nice job .
but i actually dislike another lady . she is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . but the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . she would tell you what to do and where to put things .
well i am a little bit out of shape . i think i should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ?
i 'm sure you 'll be able to grow it down in a bit .
the news is a horrible driver .
we provide free retirement and weekend insurance .
i have to blow my nose .
well we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . the trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the workout plan .
what else ?
since everyone is different your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . then you 'llbe taught all the necessary techniques to us
sounds pretty good . i like that .
we charge a 1 euro commission on each deal . how much is it to send a deposit ?
perhaps one month . i 'll just have a try at first .
i think it is easy . the traffic is not bad . it is so heavy .
yes i have . i collect stamps chinese stamps as well as those from other countries .
oh that s interesting and but what kind of things ?
several things for example various coins stamps stones and so on .
stones ? i know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?
you know you have to pay one of the funds i use for various coins and so many times you buy .
well i can t just image it .
not bad . how are you doing ?
ok . i 'll be back in a minute .
do you mean that we have to work in south america ?
would you like to tell me something about your outstanding achievements ?
yes . but i 'm not so sure whether i can get a good job .
where 's my card ?
why is that ?
i 'm pretty good you know . i 've been looking for a job for a long time . it 's so nice to see you again .
how lovely ! i 'll see you then !
how 's that ?
yes it is .
yeah so they 're a total <unk> .
i like fishing very much but i do n't like beer .
yes summer is coming .
well sometimes i think of how things could have turned out if i had done things a little differently .
yeah . oh no wonder you 're right .
i 'm sorry honey . i do n't even know .
i like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again . in spring the weather is great .
now you can be careful .
yes it 's very beautiful .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
with pleasure . i 'd love to .
i got it . i won t bother you any more .
i can not speak spanish but i never see them in public school .
i did n't know you were a good singer . you must go to the concert .
i got it . i learned it a lot .
do you have a favorite band or just moved in ?
i m afraid not . you know there are many schools in the museum .
i went to the university of ohio in america .
that s good advice .
i do n't know . i think the most important thing is that i should be there .
i 've been thinking about where to go now .
is there a swimming pool in your class ?
i was n't told anything .
ok . what 's the fare ?
i want to study abroad . i m not sure if i d like to do that .
maybe i should help .
you 're such a wimp ! you 're afraid of an eyelash curler .
have you got a class schedule for that kind of job ?
thanks for my bank . it 's a pleasure talking with you .
heard about it . it 's called the lantern festival .
oh yes it was really a good movie . i have n't seen you for quite a long time . have you seen the version ?
let me think . you will love this place .
not really . the original ones are so interesting .
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
it 's interesting and i want to buy one home .
yes it deserves its name . and its name is its location .
and i bet it does .
certainly ! can you tell me about the safety features of your <unk> ?
really ? i love them . they 're very popular now .
it 's a traditional tradition because they do n't like their own customers but i do n't think i 'm interested in it .
going by no means you are not allowed to take a vacation in the future .
thank you . i do n't know how to get enough sleep in the afternoon . can you give me a prescription ?
no problem .
what else is there at the edd offices that can help me with my job search ?
really ? did you get a copy of your brochure ?
i see .
do you know of the price ?
all right . i 'll take it .
oh right . i 'd like to know about that . the magazine is on a daily basis .
that s great . i can handle it by looking at the computer and internet .
ok . let 's look at the newspaper .
you can always get dialup or del .
the food there is actually pretty good .
let me see if i can fit you in . what kind of room do you want ?
they 're most fun . the food there is fantastic too .
what do you think of these dishes ?
well i have got you three first class tickets and i have reserved your seats . your seat numbers are 8a 8b and 8c .
it s a good idea to have a combination of how many kids do you have ?
i ca n't see it .
you like the food there ?
i know . i think i like them .
you like panda express ?
yes we are out of luck .
toys ? why do we need toys for a picnic ?
no i haven t . i am really why i feel so tired .
no this is not very far from here .
well the products in themselves are very simple . it is the logo that is successful . so hello kitty is successful because of the logo but the products are very simple .
oh he 's 14 and in the past few months he 's become quieter and a bit secretive . he locks himself in his room and i think he 's running around with the wrong crowd .
and what other sports do you see ?
yes in order to prevent the telephone a extension by the company and use the express course . do you remember the game of the <unk> or the telephone ?
what can i do if i want to visit the band ?
yes . our company is in a hurry . can you find information for me ?
how do i get to the medical officer ?
i spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat .
yeah . you can also see the results with the general public .
yes of course . we have a lot of driving on the wall .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
would you like to go by train or by bus ?
say it ! what 's your plan now ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
sure . i love going out with you but i m sorry i can t .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
i like all kinds of stuff . sometimes i think the movies are exciting and the mostly active <unk> .
sure . there are so many kinds of folk performances . who like that ?
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
well the first problem is that all of the movie 's name .
thanks a lot .
clean up the mess first . it s really wet .
bill and betty have already grown up .
do n't worry . no big deal . just a common cold .
you have got a car haven t you ?
yeah it 's my favorite . we have our first date right on there .
really ? i have n't seen you for ages .
by the way are you going to the concert tomorrow ?
just stayed at home with us dave .
smile i can t believe this for it s been 20 years since we got married .
i can take a picture of the paper that you want to use .
yeah . i think it was great . can t you give me a hand ?
have you tried other plays ?
i think it 's the way i like the movie .
but this is how you know that they 're really safe .
what other kind of food do you like ?
oh no ! i heard about that his first date of the universe .
so let 's go to it this afternoon . i 'll make it tomorrow .
could you tell me more about the chinese education olympics ?
now the final is to ms . yang . it seems that all the people are listening to the economy .
of course i do . it 's a good habit .
it does n't matter to me .
oh ! the music has stopped .
ok . take the underground the circle line to high street kensington high street . you will see a small charge on the roll sheet .
really ? it was very interesting .
well there is no one else to be far away from her .
i am sure you know i can do it very well .
so do i . that is just what i wanted to do .
it 's martin <unk> . you liked his film the departed did n't you ?
you are a mathematician .
you said it . you know he had a great sense of humor . here 's a special page about kung fu .
of course i designed a more powerful gasoline engine which greatly increased the speed of limousines .
i usually have the wrong notion that he 's very serious .
there s so much i want to do . i ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . i just ran a search for music to download .
i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
thanks . that would be very helpful . i ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . there s too much information on the net .
when you sent your emails did you attach any files to them ?
yes i did . there s an antivirus programme with my email account that <unk> all attachments so i m sure i haven t sent anything nasty to anyone .
when you use the internet be careful not to give out your email address very often . if you do you might get a lot of <unk> email form companies trying to sell you things .
that s good advice . i should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself such as my password and credit car number .
that s right . another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time
how do i do that ?
take this web page for example . press the keys control and d together . click on favourites at the top of the screen . there you are . it has been added to you favourites list . if you click it you will
that s useful to know . thanks . i ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .
can you tell me something about your background ?
i love being ! if i were famous i d do interviews for all the top magazines like cosmo and elle .
i wouldn t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice but it would get tedious after a while . imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you .
noone really believes gossip columnists .
i think you ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . you d also have to be very careful about every word you said . if you <unk> on a chat show and said something silly it
i d like to do that . i d like to be a good manager to give me a good manager .
that s a great idea . which charities would you support ?
i love children as you know so probably a children s charity .
you d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity so you d really need to be very careful . anyway i d be the first to buy your posters and i d attend your first book
thanks but i also like to help other people s privacy . i m sure i could say it s my first time .
yes it is . thanks . i m just surfing on the internet .
here ? in this cafe ? how can you do that ?
this cafe offers a wireless internet connection . that means i can get on the net for free while i m here . of course i have to buy a cup of coffee !
that s great . can you do it anywhere ?
no . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . there are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
so what programs do you have on your laptop ?
i ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs .
i know you are keen on photography . it s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone anywhere at a
it s wonderful isn t it ? would you like to see some photos that i took recently ?
yes i do . i also use an antispyware program and a firewall . there are so many on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . you have to be very c
how often do you run your antivirus program ?
i usually run it every few days . it finds a virus about half the time .
which antivirus program would you recommend ?
have you tried this one ? it s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . you can also download updates for free .
that would be very good . which website should i visit to download it ?
just a minute . i 'll send you an email with the internet . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the set up procedures .
what do you use your computer for ?
i use it for several the net word processing and creating presentations . i don t play many games on my computer but i do a lot of work with photographs . using a computer program you
what kind of information are you interested in ?
i use it almost every day but i usually only use it to check my email . i don t often surf the net . you use the internet a lot don t you ?
yes . i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . it can be frustrating when the connection is poor .
so you re online eight hours a day .
yes i like the job though . sometimes i help other people in the office if they re having trouble online .
how useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?
i think it s fairly useful but there are two big problems . first a lot of the information you find online is false . second when you buy something online you don t see it until you actually get it .
so what ?
what i do is find the website of shops . then someone from our company <unk> the shop and buys when they re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .
i d say the main reason is poverty . countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . if their neighbors have some resources they try to steal them by military force .
it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end .
how do you think they could be ended ?
i don t think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . the thing is to find the real pro
so if the cause is poverty there should be a programme to make the country richer . if the problem is resources share them .
it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality it 's harder to make peace between countries .
yes . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .
the problem is that many poor people might suffer .
would you like to live in the country ? i m not sure i d like it .
i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that for me each advantage has its own disadvantage .
thanks for the offer but i think it should be enough for the job .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
you re right . i m not so sure about the work . i think you ll have to be able to find a planet on the day .
people can t have it both ways . if you live in the country it is often less convenient . if you live in a city it is noisy buy there s more to do .
i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they re so much better to look at than concrete rows of parked cars and tall buildings .
i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . when the wind blows in the city you get dust in your mouth and in your mouth .
the view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . there s so sign of pollution . the village looks so peaceful .
just remember that in that village there s nothing to do . there s not even a pub or restaurant . there s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .
you re right . i would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . i would hate living in the country !
yes i mean it .
i m fine .
because you re in our system . and you re the most experienced student student student student student government to help you .
i thought you were good at it . you should have seen that many of the film .
yes . you have to apply for an additional fee .
they have a great variety of clients . they also have a very good reputation for their group of years .
we did n't pay attention to the environment cut down trees and polluted the air .
do you have to pay to use to use the fare ?
why not ! it s a classic in fact it s one of my favorite novels .
but it s so old .
don t judge a book by its cover . do you kwon what it s about ?
no not at all .
if you do n't have any hobbies . you can get a hold of them .
i didn t realize it was a romance novel .
well i ve always been interested in that .
why does he want to do that ?
because you know he is often in trouble .
won t they get his inheritance ?
no that s the problem . though they are welloff once he dies his house will go to his cousin . so when he dies the girls will have nothing .
i see . this sounds interesting ! maybe my teacher isn t so horrible after all .
so are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
there s movie ? my teacher didn t tell me that !
yes it s a sad story .
it would take a lot less time . . .
how about this . when you finish the book . i ll get the movie and watch it with you .
o . k . thanks for the offer .
i only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . i don t think that tv is bad for kids . i think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes .
perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first .
if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch remember to have something else for them to do . if you don t they ll get bored and misbehave .
they could go out and play with their friends .
sure . you could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time .
perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . he watches too much tv too .
that s a good idea . remember that if the parents watch too much tv the kids will probably follow suit .
i like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . but i don t like traveling to work waiting for buses or . .
or getting stuck in traffic jams when you re driving .
exactly .
it 's gone with the wind .
what 's it about ?
i enjoy the various characters and the plot .
well . i like the thorn birds best .
is it very interesting ?
sure . i get a lot of information and make many friends .
thanks for the advice .
would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
yes i do . i need to buy a textbook for my course and as you know i love browsing through the latest paperbacks .
it 's the best seller everyone 's been talking about for the last six months .
how in the world did you get a copy ? i 've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i 'm still waiting my turn .
i checked it out of the rental library . it only costs five cents a day .
how much was it going to cost you ?
i ca n't tell yet . i have n't got beyond the first chapter .
if it 's any good i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
not a great deal .
i 've just been reading an article about them . they ll be used for all sorts of things now .
for accounting system and things like that you mean ?
yes but they are used for other things too . do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to paris .
so we did n't have a very good time .
i bought this here yesterday but it does n't work .
of course his machine must have been connected to a computer .
that 's right .
don t you think i understand what you mean . but i know you ve done a lot of reading and money .
that 's amazing . i got to know what you 're doing right .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
yes it 's ok .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
ok please wait for a moment . i 'll give you the receipt .
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
i can read the subtitles . my set is a hugescreen one .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
oh what s he like ?
well he s got dark hair and brown eyes .
yes .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
um that s good .
yes but he s got a wife and 3 children as well .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .
what happened ?
it 's the end of the world for me .
what makes you say that ?
i do n't see anything wrong with what we 're doing ! that 's just the problem . in these kind of things the trouble does n't always appear at first .
oh that 's too bad . work harder next term .
b i 'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me .
do n't lose heart . everything will be fine .
thanks . would you like a cup of tea or coffee ?
yes of course . this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
i m glad you re enjoying it .
thank you for the invitation .
it s my pleasure . would you like another glass of champagne ?
yes please . thank you for everything .
sure . have you got the tickets ?
why not ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
that s sounds great .
when are you going to make it ?
no . i d better not .
why not ?
i spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat .
i m looking at my horoscope for this month ! my outlook is very positive . it says that i should take a vacation to someplace exotic and that i will have a passionate summer fling !
what are you talking about ? let me see that . . . what are <unk> ?
it s a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign . you have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . i was born on april 15th so i m an aries . when were you born ?
january 5th .
let s see . . . you re a capricorn . it says that you will be feeling stress at work but you could see new exciting developments in your love life . looks like we ll both have interesting summers !
that s bogus . i do n't feel any stress at work and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
no it s not your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . see ? it says that an aries is energetic and loves to socialize .
well you certainly match those criteria but they re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ?
a capricorn is <unk> and practical . she likes to do things in conventional ways . that sounds just like you !
ok ! how about <unk> ?
no a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . i m going to describe someone s face and you guess who it is !
fun ! i m only gonna get you . you ve got to take a chance . i m really bored about going .
let me put your cases into the trunk and please get in the back .
our cousin pete ! my turn ! she has a nose <unk> eyes and a mole on her chin !
aunt rose ! that mole is so huge ! ok my turn . he has a crooked nose and full lips . he has quite a few freckles and an oval face . oh he is also bald !
your future husband !
not funny .
i 'm going to my parents house for my father 's birthday .
mumm . no .
ah yes it is . i 'm calling to tell you that our funds for the party has finally been canceled .
what ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . .
what are you talking about ?
this is bigger than the super bowl man ! teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that . they first start in a group stage with bigger groups each g
what are your strengths and weaknesses ?
are you kidding ? over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup ! it s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! each nation is cheering on their team hoping they will bec
all right . i m not his fan of soccer games ! you know i don t like the game show . it seems like a good match .
whatever i m going to go watch the opening match .
mine was ok except that no one in my class speaks english . i guess it will force me to <unk> in chinese more in chinese more in class so at least i should improve a lot this semester .
that s both fortunate and unfortunate . it s the united nations in my class . we have people from all over the world ! there are three germans a pole a scottish two french an american a brazilian
that s the whole point . she s the whole point in making a lot of improvement in marketing . that s why many people think everyone knows the king .
well when do you like it ?
i guess so . i think i d say i you 're a good man . i love to try some new learning how to make and ideas .
don t ! stay the course ! your spoken chinese will be eternally grateful . i bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice .
i highly doubt it . your girlfriend is chinese .
well there is that yes .
it s a good day for the city . i don t think the beach is coming up and i m getting a little tired !
there we go . can you help me with the umbrella ? my wife told me she was the beach and we had a barbecue there .
ok kids here <unk> beach ball and a frisbee a pail and a shovel . i want to see an impressive <unk> by the time we leave . don t stray too far . wait ! leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes
and stay in the shallow area . i don t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! it s too deep out there and we didn t bring your .
see you tomorrow . did you have any other suggestions ?
what ? a jellyfish ? jeremy put that down right now ! it could sting you !
ah ! not on me ! ow !

so what are you going to do ? take up an art class or something ?
well first of all i ve decided to stop smoking . it s not that i m pinching pennies or anything it s just that i ve been smoking since i was sixteen and i think it s time to stop .
i m with you on that one . anything else you re planning on doing ?
one last thing i ve decided to come out of the closet .
it s about time !
thanks ma am . you re a lifesaver .
is that right ? i went to the police every day . my cholesterol is up .
well i hope it s not your birthday today .
there s a good shopping list of chores while we re in the apartment .
ha ! she s just a little bit crazy .
but she bought some new sneakers for me and she does n't like it .
no i m serious .
it s a lovely question . i mean why we have a special account on each page . it s cheap and just like a simple sneakers in my opinion .
sure . how about a coke ?
here you are .
i am . what 's your name ?
i think i am chicken !
thank you . i 'll bring your order right away .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
sure . i 'd love to .
well do you have any hobbies like playing tennis or things like that ?
well i 'm going to work .
thanks i will . how are you going ?
thank you .
it does n't take long .
it 's nice to see you again . how are you ?

that 's great .
i 'm probably going to spend the day looking at cars .
i 'm afraid so . i 'm terribly sorry .
ok .
you re lucky !

do you think the beijing characteristic for the new project should be done by the end of the week ?
well there 's a really action movie and i love most about the female stuff .
yeah i guess it 's a good movie .
that 's unless there is a traffic jam . it could take three hours .
maybe not . but i 'm sure it 's your fault .
i do n't but i like fish .
do you like fish then ?
yes that is a good idea .
let 's go to the latin club . i never want to see it again !
i like renaldo the most .
what kind of soup would you like ?
i do n't know . he has no one to count on .
i prefer cold if you don t mind .
what kind of flowers would you like ?
yes . i had to be a part of the recession . but i do n't like them very much .
no . i ve been here for two years .
let 's look at the campbell project .

you know just giving me lots to do . i 'm really busy right now .
are you ? what are you busy with ?
oh lots of things . mostly training new people .
me too . oh no . you 're really tired .
i can play drums but i am not a good player . i will play it well .
i know . it 's too hard to believe . . .
you want to watch don t you ?
i 'll be very busy . what time is your appointment ?
i hope they are both .
i hope you will do better soon .
i was robbed this morning .
and did you play football ?
you 're going to do my homework .
i have to admit i will . i just have to learn how to use the telex to the club and the make fun of the team .
promise ?
yeah i think so . oh by the way i need to ask you something .
what 's that ?
it 's a hotel but cheaper and offers free parking .
sure . oh that reminds me . could i borrow your black leather boots ?
my boots ? er . . . sure ok .
we are going to disneyland .
are you sure ?
i heard it was her . she is very tall and slim .
i will .
it s true . i don t know what but i did . i don t know what has been to recently .
what about the features in your resume ?
well i know it s not my fault . so i am thinking about learning how to give a raise .
i think it is a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally .
george how can we ? vacations cost money . and this month we don t have much money left after paying the rent .
well lili we can visit different places in the state in our van . we are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . trust me it won t cost much .
where will we sleep then ?
in the van .
what about other expenses ?
let s see . gas food recreation we won t spend much . come on . don t hesitate . we need to get out of the house once in a while . we have been working hard haven t we ?
maybe you re right . when do you plan to go ?
the sooner the better ! i can t wait !
oh i don t know where we re going yet .
as long as we re going you can decide where to go . i trust your <unk> . i know you miss chinese food so we can eat at a chinese restaurant this time .
let s go to chicago . we can have lunch in chinatown . then we can go to a ball game at <unk> field !
sounds like a good idea . we can discuss the problems of the bread .
i found the ideal position . i m working for a plumbing company .
this afternoon is really wonderful . can you describe me where you are at ?
plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge and creativity . i love this job .
i can see that . but i didn t know you had experience in that line of work .
i didn t but i applied for an apprenticeship and since i studied math and i have a good attitude 4 my application was accepted .
congratulations ! you do have the right attitude .
when you re under the gun .
you can list your education at the top or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive .
i m sure you ll enjoy the trip .
you should go and watch an american idol .
well we could go to a movie theater in the afternoon . you could come with me tomorrow . i am going to the student government .
that s okay . i guess it s better to prepare a brain .
i m fine only for a couple of people so i only have a good rest .
i m ok . and i can t really use any beer .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
yes i am reading the book on it .
how about having a game of bridge ?
about 10 of the gross sales .
do you have any other plans for the night ?
i have to tell you something else that you probably won t like .
but i m not interested in it .
palmistry ? what is that ?
it 's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future .
oh you mean palm reading . i 've seen that before but i do n't believe in it .
are you sure ? i 've read a lot about palmistry and i 've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . do you want me to take a look at your hand ?
really ? you 've read books about it ? ok then . but only if you want to .
ok let 's see well you 've got a long life line which is good and the love line is strong . . .
what else do you see ? will i be successful ? will i make a lot of money ?
hmm hard to say wait yes it looks like you will do well in business and your ambition will help you a lot but . .
you 're right . we can go to the movies . i guess the same is true .
i do n't know how to explain it to you .
can i have the details for you ?
no not really . why do you ask ?
because i want to tell you about the time that i saw a ghost .
you saw a ghost ? when ?
it was many years ago when i was a little child . it was the middle of the night and i went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . i walked out of the air and was at the top of the stairs when . .
so you have seen the other place in your house ? did you pick up the red ?
it was a big green thing that looked like a person . it was in the kitchen and it slowly moved towards the stairs . .
so what did you do ?
i talked to her for a while but she s really depressed . so i made an appointment with the school counselor for her .
until what ? what happened ? did you see it clearly ? did it attack you ?
it moved slowly up the stairs step by step and i could n't stop getting a chance to move .
i just found out that my husband is cheating on me .
you mean mark ? he seems like such an honest guy .
that 's what i thought . it seems that he 's been seeing someone else for about two months .
two months ? how did you find out ?
i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . i picked it up and a girl asked to talk to mark . she then asked if i was his sister and i said no i was his wife . she hung up immediately .
so you asked him about the girl who called ?
yeah he first said it was someone from work . he gave me a lame excuse and so i pressed him on it .
what 'd he do ?
he kept trying to make stupid excuses and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion .
oh no ! what did the say about the new page ?
you know . he did n't have a fight after his first date .
i think you are absolutely right .
i couldn t have a problem with my class . it s easy to find a decent place in shanghai .
sure .
you are such a good voice . how do you like the foxtrot ?
dad you re a bit tired . you know how to swim are you ?
that 's not the reason .
but that is not the reason why i am taking it .
i see .
sure . but a lot of people think that it s important to be able to learn the language well .
well i just bought some special computer and some porcelain . do you like them ?
i love to see the oldies like the sound of music gone with the wind . they are realty the best in the acting the scene and the plot .
nothing much .
i 'd love to but i 'm afraid it will have to be hard for me .
ok . do you want to work fulltime or parttime ?
it 's a luminous price .
can i have my own experience ?
i am going to be up this morning .
i know you 're right . i like the sound of expert .
i do n't think there 's any excuse for his acting in some parts .
how do you pay for it ?
i 'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments .
tell me if you need help .
no i am not eating there anymore . i have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . the food served in the cafeteria is not my type . i am a total meat lover . but the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . they have been serving the chinese cabbage and
the vegetables are very fresh and they re not eaten at the moment .
well then the cafeteria suits you best . but anyway if you like to have a lunch outside the company feel free to join me anytime .
it 's exciting .
where are you going to work then in australia or back in china ?
i 'm planning to return to china after graduation .
why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad .
well i think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment .
yeah china 's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country .
of course ! it is the no . 1 <unk> in my life . you know job stress has become a very common problem these days . so we must learn to cope with it .
totally agree . what is your solution ?
well there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress both we and the companies should do something . for me i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know all work and no play make jack a dull boy .
you are right we do have an appointment for six months . what do you think we should do ?
it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
but i don t think we can change our working condition . anyway we are not the bosses .
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them like <unk> deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
he did n't even know what he 's doing . i i think he 's done it well .
is n't that a bad idea ?
yes they were .
right so if you had to apply the amount before you sign up for the deposit in our bank account with you will definitely have to pay some small fee .
what about the smaller components ?
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .
are you sure you have made an appointment ?
you mean on the shelf ?
you mean on product availability reliability and price ?
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
hi jason . i 'm going to throw a party on friday night .
i know ! but you are a headhunter . he 'll get away with me in time .
but i 'm not there .
your usual shirt and shoes .
it fits fine . i 'll take it .
i know but i think it may rain .
it looks nice . how much is it ?
it 's ok .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
so what class will you fly ? first class ?
i 'm serious .
all right . next time you will treat .
ok i 'll have a try .
is it really that they 're not delicious ?
you are right . well i you must be a vegetarian .
sure . i 'll take this one .
certainly . it s very open actually . you see that the girl in the house are usually quite old to drink . just ask the bus to drink .
i agree . this is susan .
follow me into the kitchen . you 'll love it .
thanks for your advice . i 'll talk to my fiance about it .
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda .
what do you think i should do about that ? i don t mind you have any friend .
i had my first cigarette when i was 17 .
no i do n't think it 's very famous . the chef is very skillful with our house here .
i was in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked where is your home ?
i do n't know . it 's natural in the office .
supervisor . open the door .
oh no . i will go and get it for you .
sorry mum i 'll keep it away .
sure . it 's very important for you to be punctual . interviewers usually don t think much of a candidate who comes 5 or 10 minutes late .
have you got a temperature ?
why not ?
i feel like having some dumplings . let 's go out to eat .
i 'll just try chinese wine .
do you want to sit near the window ? i do n't think i can go with you .
yeah i heard . is that the red wine ok ?
it is .
those are beautiful . what did you think of it ?
yeah he 's almost been with a ah you know .
yeah that would be a very good choice .
yes i m not sure . we can also see a piece of sports in the west .
are you sure ?
you are kidding me !
almost ready . are you busy now ? you seem to be in a hurry .
yes . i have lost about ten kilos .
i see .
sorry but he 's busy then too .
i see . thank you very much .
you 'd better not . it 's a pity .
i like spring .
i prefer summer especially the summer evenings . when the sun comes down it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . after a rain shower the smell of the air is refreshing . it is also a best reason for icecream .
how do you get through the stuffy daytime ?
well i have to hide in the airconditioned rooms . anyway it is all worth just think about the cool evening time .
fantastic ! i enjoy especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad full of smoke and the music is too loud so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
how did you have to do that ?
i bumped it by accident but i did n't mean to do it .
sounds cool ! but that is not what a lady should do . people are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk .
oh that sounds great !
that 's too late .
you 're right . and i 'd like to be able to get a parttime job too .
yeah .
why do n't you speak english ?
our school did . they played really well .
really ? you don t look very chinese to me if you don t mind me saying so .
the score was 10198 .
wonderful !
i 'm very sorry to hear that . how are you ?
fine just fine . and you ?
not bad . it really is great to see you again . w here have you been ?
i went to visit an uncle in san francisco .
better take the subway . it s faster and more convenient .
en where do we pay the fares ?
we have a rather comprehensive subway system here . you can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy .
where do we pay the fare ?
follow me please .
oh i see . so i can get a pair of things at the bottom .
cash credit card or debit card ?
you can take the subway to get there .
i 've never seen a place before . is that a tour ?
no you do n't .
is that so ? i did n't know it . can i possibly borrow a jacket and a tie ?
i am sorry you ca n't borrow a jacket and a tie .
then we 'll return to the hotel and come back will you change the appointment ?
certainly what time will you come back ?
at 7 please .
can i get your drink now ?
a party of 13 .
what kind of reservation ?
er . . . hum . . got it .
then open that window . yeah that one .
oh sorry . i didn t notice it . sorry .
and that 's it . you 're done .
i see what you mean . that was pretty easy after all .
no . it 's all yours .
oh thank you .
you are welcome . please press the button when you need any help .
thank you very much .
i just lost my job . my boss just told me .
that 's unbelievable . why did this happen ?
i do n't understand of myself . it seems they have to save money .
i 've got to know that . you 're new here .
come on . we are really looking forward to your new job .
you had a long flight you must be tired .
great ! could you drop me off on the table ?
ok . let s go .
yeah the news is a bank manager .
i feel very tired and need a rest .
and a storm blew our roof away .
emm . . . yes . but i was n't too impressed . i found her a little stuck up .
you are kidding but she 's so helpful .
tom . . . you are her boss you down . of course she 's helpful to you .
come on . she 's like that with everyone .
i do n't think so actually . she never even says hello to me .
thanks . wow you too .
that 's too bad . what problems are you having .
oh the whole house needs repainting for starters . the carpet in the living room is worn out and i 'd like to put in new walltowall carpeting . last week i had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . anyway all par for the course when you own a house i guess . i think i am going to hire an interior <unk> to look the place over .
i 've studied home decoration as a hobby . could i make some suggestions ?
sure . but you can only have four minutes of time .
how do you get along with the american students in your classes ?
sounds good . do you have any experiences in your work ?
you are welcome jack . glad to be of help .
oh i heard about him . he had a good time .
why did you tell me to change your job ?
yes i heard it was a very exciting game but i still do n't like it . what did you think ?
you have to be realistic . not the most important thing is that we can communicate with each other and other easily .
hello is doris available ?
hi lily ! how are you doing ?
nice to meet you .
yes i did . have you lived here long ?
me ? i guess so . i 've lived here for about six years now . have you lived in america very long ?

that was it . i couldn t eat anything .
i stayed up last night .
did you have something on your mind ? you look so concerned ! maybe i can help you .
well i 'm under a lot of pressure . my boss is very pushy . he assigned me two projects . now the deadlines are near and i still have n't finish one of them .
is there anything i can do for you ?
i 'm looking for a black leather bag .
doctor i feel much like a million dollars for me .
can you fill it out please ?
i believe it does .
cool ! we 'll just have to wait for ucla .
it was 36 hours .
all right !
thanks for the advice . i 've tried hard to make it .
well suffer then . if you have a toothache you have to go to the dentist .
no we do n't . we just make an impression of us .
yeah the government really takes a bite doesn t it ?
so he said it 's one of the two things .
yeah i think we the same way . it seems that they do n't have to carry much cash on me without paying a credit card . i think it should really be a lot of fun .
yeah . i was thinking about buying for a monthly order i can give you a discount .
my company will be developing so fast .
let s just hope the politicians don t figure out a way to spend it .
really ? maybe they can have none of it .
i saw a movie with a few friends who had a really good time .
really ? i have been watching a lot of videos .
i think it 's a little . you know i 'm thinking of going to see a movie .
of course not . go ahead .
how long do you think it will take to get to union square .
laura .

how often ?
three times a year at most . how do you feel about this ?
who s that ?
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .

yes . swimming is one of my most favorite sports indoors or outdoors .
i like it very much . it 's a little tight .

i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
i see . thank you very much .
do you want to know something about this one ?
thank you for inviting me .
i grow a variety of things so that something is in bloom all year round .
when is your garden at its best ?
it looks best in spring when the plum and cherry blossoms are out .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm going to travel to the university of sydney .
i hope i don t ever see you back in here .

tasha mountain ? it 's very famous in china is n't ?
i think i have an aisle seat .
my house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture .
i 'm so sorry to hear that .
yes i have . i have n't been in one of these years . i have trouble with them .
yes i like winter too . but i 've never heard of it .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
i could n't agree with you more . it would be wonderful to have a city in florida .
what are you doing here ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
okay . did you want to come ?
yes it 's beautiful .
what 's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
it 's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there 's a chance of freezing rain .
that 's all right . i wish it did n't rain .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
i 'm supposed to work on a paper that 'd due on monday .
have you ever tried to come to this interview ?
i suppose i should . i do n't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
i just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
if you 're lucky it 'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !
if that happens then i 'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
that sounds like fun .
do you think you can come ?
what 's up ?
no . what 's up ?
what are you doing ?
i 'm going to my parents house for my father 's birthday .
how old is he today ?
it is his 50th birthday .
well wish him a happy birthday for me .
sure thing . what are your plans for the evening ?
i was just thinking of going to a movie tonight .
well if you can wait until tomorrow night i 'll go with you then .
sorry i 've got people coming over tomorrow night .
sounds like this weekend just is n't going to work out for us .
sounds that way . maybe some other time then ?
sure . hey i 'm sorry but i 've got to get going .
yeah me too . it 's about time i made a move .
say hello to your friends for me .
likewise . see you later .
uhhuh . . .
it 's beethoven . do you like it ?
i think beethoven's music is incredible . i 've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent too . do you believe that ?
i do n't know about that but i do think that it helps people relax .
what other kind of music do you listen to ?
actually i mostly just listen classical music . what about you ?
to be honest i think classical music is too complicated for me .
there s a mix of music .
i like pop music . do you ?
not really . i do n't think pop music has much depth .
i see what you mean . i think i can see more of my favorite movie !
how long have you been in to pop music then ?
i 've always been into it . have you always liked classical music ?
not really . when i was little we did n't really listen to music at all .
so how did you become interested in it ?
well when i was about 10 years old i started playing the piano . i think that 's how it all started .
do you still play piano ?
yes it 's one of my hobbies .
what kind of movie is it ? i don t like many of his movies actually .
it s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead .
well that s a horror movie . i like thrillers and i didn t like anything of very much .
what did the critic say ?
he didn t say it was bad but he said that it wasn t as good as it could have been particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it .
the movie starts at eight o clock so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
good . dinner is nearly ready and i d like to watch the news before we go . the oscars were last night and i want to see the results .
i won t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . there were a few surprises .
i like current affairs programs and documentaries especially wildlife ones . how about the sports ones ?
i like those kinds of programs too . they re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
people always seem to like the tv .
yeah . and that s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !
right . you can t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . they need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs .
as long as you don t know how to pay a membership fee .
that s great idea . but don t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?
no . they don t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ?
not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! that s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv where you pay a fixed amount each month .
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country but people don t seem to keen to keen to pay for their tv programs . besides the <unk> channels offer a good range of programs .
in that case there s a good idea . for the tv station is a very high standard of the programs .
it s a little of ve had though . i don t know what to do .
did you have any idea of the interview ?
i have had disagreement with every director . i ve worked with . we ve always in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . it was the same when i made this movie . i don t know where <unk> of my disagreement with rachel kelly come from . i enjoyed making the movie very much . i enjoyed making the movie very much . i enjoyed making the movie very much . i enjoyed making the movie very much .
critics are not very happy with the movies that you ve made recently . does that bother you ?
not at all . the feedback from audience has been great . i care about what they think more than what the critics think .
did you do you own stunts in the movie ?
i wanted to but my insurance company wouldn t let me . all of my stunts were done by a . as you know i used to do my own stunts but i ll leave that to the experts in future .
thank you very much for doing this interview .
my pleasure . have you seen the movie yet ?
yes . i have . i liked it very much . like you i was very impressed with rachel s performance in the movie . she s going to be a star .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
yes i experienced one when i was in tokyo once . the tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over .
do you know where it measured on the richter scale ?
i do n't remember but it was n't very serious . have you ever been in an earthquake ?
no but i was in quite a few tornados when i was younger .
where are you from ?
i 'm from germany .
did your house ever get damaged from the winds ?
most of the time we were lucky but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room .
wow that must have really been scary .
actually some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass .
are you quite a bit ?
no but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
that sure did n't last long !
i 'm doing fine thanks . what about you ?
what happened to him ?
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
was it his first offence ?
unfortunately not . he was charged with a when he was in university .
what happened to him then ?
not much it was a minor offence back then . he got away with a fine of 500 .
unfortunately he was not born in the us !
no they were really easy on him . the problem is that was a long time ago . they are much tougher on crime now .
what do you think will happen to him ?
well he 'll definitely lose his license pay a fine and maybe even spend some time in jail .
that does n't sound too promising . does he have a defence lawyer ?
yes . he 's not in a hurry .
my sister is a lawyer . i can ask her if she can help him .
that 'd be great ! i know he 'd appreciate your help .
i think that we should pay attention to what we eat .
how would you solve the problem ?
i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .
it would probably be very expensive .
i don t think that is too much for rent .
it s not a bad idea . i think education is the biggest problem at the moment . schools don t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly .
if we are to invest more money to education we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn t be popular with voters .
most voters what everything bout ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things but without increasing taxes .
the government should show that most of the country is unemployment but traditional social customs and there are not enough workers to pay for the whole bill .
yes . the government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money .
it was ok . we had a lot of time .
i 'm sorry but i do n't know what 's wrong .
but they are so delicious . i have to follow them .
i do n't know . i know a lot about chinese medicine .
i think i 'll buy a pair of shoes for my good shoes . they are very tasty .
i see . i 'll send a larger to pick up my camera and my wife 's name .
yes . i have two cartons of cigarettes one bottle of whisky .
yes . i 'm sure i 've seen you before .
yes . we got to ask for a new employee and also some business information for our company .
i see . i 'll take five of them .
yes they are not future . i think they will continue to provide for a new knowledge and also provide compensation for his own use .
i know . but i do n't think it 's so expensive .
i know but i have done a lot of work . i should just pay part of it .
no . but my father has never . he usually keeps me busy telling the truth about what to do .
to be honest i had a really bad time . i 'm in a hurry .
well now we 're stuck . what can we do ?
that 's not why . this one is for everyone .
oh come on . we 'll be careful .
i 'm afraid i 'll have to go . i 'm going to take a gym nearby .
what happened ?
it cost 24 a month .
what 's wrong ?
then my son drove into a tree .
why ? do n't you make some cheaper ?
i have the but i 've seen it all the time .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you can use your credit card and help yourself to work .
i m going to start a new job . i ll go to the bookstore .
did you ever see the apartment ?
yes i have . i can t wait to get the price ready .
i know you should really get some exercise .
he 's outgoing . what do you want to know ?
do you get much rain during the summer ?
well what 's the price for this flat ?
well it 's hard to say .
really ? i 'll have a try .
here you go honey fried eggs .
what 's it ?
the guy on the right .
it looks like it may rain .
he is in prison now . he was copped outstealing .
i was looking forward to it .
well tell him to call me back when you are in .
what size do you want ?
he 's the one who saved the life of my son at the beach last year .
ok . you know i have to get a good rest at the pub .
i need you to pay a fine .
how about individual games like the rubik 's cube or solitaire ?
it 's a great game . you can go .
this is a specialty . you can keep it as the shop .
how can i prevent the bad from being on such a long period ?
have you thought about going to dinner ?
yes we 're going to .
good . i have to think about it .
good . maybe i can find the way to go home to talk to my office .
good for you . i hope it can be a good opportunity to get together and make up my mind .
where is the football game ?
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
i have to make sure to take the whole 15 days off .
wow . that 's too much for me . do n't you have anything cheaper ?
i have to think about it but i have to know the reason that i have to go .
sorry . but it 's true . the bus drivers have some very good grades .
make sure you have to blow out all the paperwork .
i have confidence in you .
another big step forward in saving on our office equipment i don t need a desktop anymore . it is a gift for you .
i have confidence in helping me .
then there is a problem with desertification . climate change and overfarming are causing farmland to turn into desert . in china we must make enough food .
i 'd love to . all the souvenirs of the world are used for human beings .
no do n't you think it 's too noisy ? i ca n't see you here . would you like to go to the cinema ?
well the sale price is 1 each .
that sounds reasonable .
no but i ended up finding out later that night when i saw her with another man at the club near the cafe . i saw bill 's running by the window .
can you tell me why you want to get a parttime job ?
maybe you 're not turning on the tv .
you had no idea . he is just a good friend .
good question . i have to make up an appointment for this afternoon .
i think i 'll take it .
i do n't know . it looks like you have to be late .
thanks for reminding me . i 'll continue to run to the internet every day and do some things i 'll have to do .
is it a good game ? i mean what kind of games do you like to play ?
it 's my pleasure .
where is the peeler ?
do you have any idea how to play the piano ?
good . i have to think about it .
i 'm sorry but i have never done that . . .
maybe . i can go there with my friend .
hi tom ! how are you doing ?
not very well . i ve put up the decorations here a few months ago . i m feeling the same as i ve ever had .
really ? you are so kind .
oh nothing special .
good . do you have any experience in marketing ?
i work hard but i m a team player . i am sure you will do well .
it certainly is . you do n't have to work under pressure .
how do you get along with your colleagues ?
if he wants to change someone s money i 'll have to give you an idea of the future .

you know maybe she wants to be a good friend .
but i do n't have the guts to ask her out .
haha . that 's really what i thought . i just heard that you are taking it easy .
get in .
i watched a go for you .
oh ok . if you have any questions then i 'll talk to you later .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
hold on let 's introduce her to her .
you have good fashion sense karen .
yes it does .
let me see . yes we have it ready . well it looks like we 've sold out .
i like to look at the internet . i usually use it for free . sometimes i just come to the office to check some options . sometimes i 'm buying things online but sometimes i do n't have to go to the internet at often .
that 's not a bad idea . i 'm putting on a new paper and now it 's an online dating website for a person .
why do you want to work for us ?
that 's right .
we met at a party . we met at the same time . we met at a club last year and had great time .
yeah but it is something more interesting . maybe you should have a good time .
i can help you with that .
yes it seems that the paper is becoming more popular .
my parents are already here . i forgot to pick up a paper .
who can tell us something about the author 's life ? volunteer ?
i do n't think this is fresh .
what ?
it 's a job at a recruitment agency .
yes it is . what s your job going ?
yes it is . but you are paying for the rent .
right we have a good plan for what we 'll see . . .
that 's not a problem . by the way do you know if i need help ?
you have good taste . it 's perfect .
you are welcome . good luck bye .
i like to play golf play badminton or crack jokes .
how about the movie ?
how do you want to spend your money ?
i like all kinds of stuff . i admit i love romance .
you can read it in the original set of the original set . and the part of the songs used to be used within a week .
what did the program say ?
yes . we just renovated a few month ago .
here you are .
i go there every day .
what are the most important thing about the holiday of the year ?
me too . the weather is so lovely .
you have to try it . you know if the stone is a little expensive .
sure . it 's a most popular dish .
a good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases . their people go out and do real reporting talking to people at the stock exchange fund managers analysts etc .
yes . here we are . the fitting room is over there .
is it a horror movie ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
hey how would you like to taste my fist ?
alright all joking aside what kinds of moves do you like ?
um let me see romance comedy . documentary action science fiction animated and so on .
that is to say you like all except for horror movies .
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
the notebook is this type of movie .
really ? you got a new promotion .
well then this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . i bet you 'd love it .
ok . i ca n't wait to see it . let 's go !
i had a drop too much last night . i attended a banquet given by a chinese colleague of mine . and it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a chinese table .
you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or friends is a way of friendship especially in northern china .
impressive ! what about some of your <unk> ?
you should keep up the mind . all these <unk> be made of mind to personal use eye .
what does the qualification needed by insurance ?
then he must be opening his heart to the friends . in a word as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort no one will at you .
i got you . next time . i 'll <unk> a toast with a statement like i ca n't drink any more and then drink anyway .
really ? where did you hear that ?
i met with the supervisor just this morning . i do n't know but i am a little worried . who do you think will get sacked ?
i 'm not sure . . . well first it could n't be george . he is such a <unk> . he 'd wash the boss 's dog if he asked .
no it 's not going to be george . i do n't think it 's andy either . he is involved with the boss 's sister inlaw . and you know how whipped our boss is .
that 's true . what about lisa ? i bet there 's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
lisa ? no way . i 've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . you know rumors ca n't come out from nowhere .
well okay . then there is still michael . but he 's the boss pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . it definitely wo n't be michael .
no that would be crazy . but then who will it be ? oh dear it must be me . i should have known it ! why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . what should i do ? i 've got a family to support .
well it could be me too . but i am definitely worried .
it 's very nice . i have n't heard live music in a while . this is fun .
well then may i invite you for the next dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
do n't worry . i 'm not much of a dancer myself .
you 're dancing so well .
you dance beautifully too .
when did you learn to dance ?
in college . but i do n't dance very often . what 's your favourite dance ?
it 's hard to say . it depends . but i love the waltz .
how about tango ?
oh i like it . it 's such a beautiful dance but i ca n't do it well . what about you ?
tango is my favorite . anything but <unk> or the foxtrot . the music has stopped
thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
yes it is .
oh i 'm sorry .
i think so . i feel very hot .
is it possible to take a look at the newspaper ?
it 's certainly a pleasure .
what 's the western channel on the board ?
last summer it always cold in the winter . i wish it could be summer . shall i go there again this afternoon ?
we wo n't be able to do that . let 's have a look at you .
i want to get a job .
oh nice . where are you going ?
i am doing a good job .
i see .
how long has it been on to the wedding ?
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for a full hour in the cold wind .
i see .
that means that i was n't going to lose it .
sounds like a very good plan .
yes i took a break ! i ll check with the heater .
so you 're quite happy with your new job ?
yes it was n't too hard to say . the equipment is very busy and i had to finish my work .
i love you happy anniversary .
i 'm afraid so . we do n't have any job so far .
well mrs . smith you must be happy with your new boss .
i do n't know . but i think it is enough for us to write a letter of inquiry to the company .
i know . i ca n't see him .
yeah i just knew it was n't so hard .
that 's what my records show .
he 's got a great sense of humor i think .
okay . but it does n't work . and i m afraid it 's too cold for me .
what ?
yes that 's right . you 're the one i have to give it a try .
but i 'm open to new things . i 'll see you tomorrow .
no . the one you have on looks fabulous especially with your hair like that .
well i 'll certainly have it if you give me a call .
it 's not just that . the dress is very attractive and it goes with your hair . also there is a high level of clothes in your room .
oh you look so lovely .
that 's not true . you know there are many foreign customers like you here . what i do is to help people .
i m too busy to hear that . i just like him and i m too busy at times .
sure . a ufo is just a space vehicle from another planet . if you think about it our space <unk> are ufos .
i 've never thought about it like that before .
i 've seen photos of ufos in america before but they 've all looked doctored up .
oh they really smell well .
is n't that good ?
why is that ?
because i love the snow .
do you think that there 's intelligent life trying to contact us ?
no but we 're trying to contact them .
i suppose you 're right .
i think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet <unk> will not become extinct .
do you really think that global warming wil destroy earth some day ?
there 's a lot of evidence that suggest it will but i do n't think it 's going to happen any time soon .
you 're in luck .
fine .
cool . what a big tree !
do n't worry . they are just a very simple thing .
it s almost like this . you can just skip it with me . i will have to get there tonight .
no . we went to the stadium .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
let me see . that one goes for 17 .
would you take 12 ?
no i can t give it to you let you have it for 12 . how about 14 ?
it s a pity .
sorry 14 is the lowest i can go .
i like ferris wheel more .
have you made a reservation ?
there s some really bad news in the kitchen . i was just thinking about how to play the game every day .
really ? then i guess i won t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
actually you might because there s a big convention in town this weekend .
i m not too worried about it . i always seem to find something .
let me check . oh oh ! it s at 325 .
wow that 's cutting it close ! that means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! what gate is it at ?
it 's at . . . gate 14 .
oh great ! that s at the other end of the terminal !
ok so here s the plan for the general terms of the universe .
be patient miss . get back to the square !
i have my own company that designs computer systems .
you know . i m going to add some layers to frame your face .
don t be silly . give me a ring .
i hope you don t like this sort of thing .
i go to the bank give up the shanghai address and check the number of the amount .
with pleasure .
can i have a look at it ?
you re welcome .
read me the index number !
i had a pretty strict upbringing and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me .
ok i will begin working on it at the moment . i just need to have a contact with you .
because i love the snow .
do you ever move from your parents ?
the question is to be a tour .
it 's inevitable . their love wasbuilt on the sand and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks .
i had a bad dream .
i ca n't see it .
i was there for about three years .
but that does make a lot of improvement in it .
can you tell me when i get a promotion ?
and your wife ?
i have been married for three years .
you have no guts !
i have been married for three years .
the fare is different from the meter .
i 'm not sure . he is in the middle of the life .
you are absolutely right .
there are 15 people in my family .
i have a large family . i have three older sisters my twin sister a younger brother and parents .
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
we 're identical . i mean we look exactly the same but we are complete opposites when it comes to everything else .
interesting . it must be great having a twin sister . are you best friends too ?
we used to be really close but that all changed once she moved to shanghai . how about your family ? you didn t mention to your father .
i did n't know that . . .
what about your stepbrother 's mother ? does he keep in touch with her ?
no she also died when my stepbrother was little . my mother and my stepfather met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . they ended up getting married a few years later .
sounds like it was meant to be .
yeah i saw the british version and the second stage of the country . it was so interesting .
oh yeah . i love the cool plot . let 's go and have a look .
but this does n't have to be the first time i 've ever heard of it .
oh it 's a <unk> . i 'm fond of the stuff .
are you sure ?
a wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . if i had drunk enough and i would have had the bold to punch him in the face .
they 're also going to be packed in a hit by the storm . it was a truck and it was a great hit on the right .
he 's a captain .
i 'll keep up with this in touch . i 'll let him know .
of course not . he is a fairly good person .
well i studied french at school but i 've never had a good time . it 's really a good thing .
he 's checking bags . he 's an official in the customs .
i was born in beijing but i spent most of my childhood in london .
do you have anything to declare ?
i had a pretty strict upbringing and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me .
really ? i know they are very popular and it 's hard to find one .
no they 're glad we 're both know .
but why is he crazy ?
i went to the university of ohio in america .
do you have anything to declare ?
i m a journalist . i write for china daily .
oh don t you have a second class ?
no sir . but i 'm really in love with you .
i see . why did you decide to leave the company ?
i have a good mind . i 'm always in the mood for a hurry .
do you know how to write a letter of recommendation ?
no i 'm just looking . i can t read it .
have you every given money to increase their income of the country ?
my husband and i have thought about it but we ve decided not to have any . they are just too expensive . besides with all the news about global warming on the news lately who knows what kind of world we ll have in the future . what about you ?
have you checked the bill ?
to be honest i 'm a <unk> so . i do n't have much time to enjoy life . what do you think ?
do you have any other plans for the sunday ?
no way ! i spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 247 . you know i 'm a really tough friend . you know i 'm a really good friend .
that 's true . do n't worry . most of the kids do the same thing .
i know mark is one of the best . but i would n't have a problem . he s so old .
so will you come to join us ?
i don t know what other people think but i for one envy only children !
that sounds great . i 'm absolutely starving ! what kind of food are you in the mood for ?
i 'd love something spicy . maybe we could get some sichuan hotpot .
you are a woman after my own heart . i do n't know many people who can handle spicy food . are you sure you are up for hot pot ?
i will . you are the boss . thank you for helping me for work not been for quite some time . i really hope i can make me feel more comfortable .
ok with me . you are the boss . i would n't have told you . i am too busy to have a wedding with my boss .
well let 's stop dragging our feet and find a sichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner !
ok i 'll tell my wife to come in and give me a try .
well . . . ? have you thought of it yet ?
no . . .
how long is it going to take ?
that is right . i m glad she would say she would name it . well please have a seat . i am so booked tonight .
you really have a big head do n't you .
i m not sure but probably about 75 years . how about in your country ?
about 70 i think . this newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . it 's a problem that will soon affect most of the world .
i heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .
perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
did she ? that s great . however if we have too many children that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .
i think so . she said she would rather be an interpreter .
oh he 's fine . kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays .
i agree . he is also an excellent speaker .
i had mine when i was 24 . that 's a little young . i d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .
yes i think you re right . i m thinking about having a child but not just yet .
is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ?
yes there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out have fun and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discourage them but they don t often succeed .
do you think you 'll ever talk to them ?
it s almost impossible to get the right balance . if you are too strict kids might ignore you . if you are too lenient they might go wild .
so did he hurt you ?
he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back . he said he didn t have the money yet .
well he should pay you back . it s only fair .
yes but i got angry with him too quickly . he probably thought that i <unk> him . i shouldn t have got angry .
did you lend him a lot of money ?
not much . i had to pay an unexpected bill so i needed the money back .
well talk to him about it next time you see him . he probably feels as bad about it as you do . close friends sometimes have disagreements . it s nothing unusual . neither of you said anything really nasty did you ?
last week i was in the movies ! i thought everything was going to be a different day !
of course you should . you wouldn t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship would you ?
i m not sure . i guess i d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time .
do you think you 'll ever talk to them ?
i agree . you ca n't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .
i think you re right . i should have a try .
so you always have fun on the plan ?
don t worry . i ll show you where i m going .
i guess you 're right . i used to be a die in the last few years .
i think you are right . what do you think about people who look like ?
for your part we are the same . actually you know i had a lot of experience in this field . i just want a to be a part of the team .
i just make eye contact with him and nod my head . then i tell him when he comes over to the table . why do you ask ?
i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
that seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .
that s what i thought . i just thought i d ask you and see what you thought of it . anyway what did you do yesterday evening ?
well it was a warm evening so i stretched my legs . i walked along the canal for a couple of miles . actually several other people had the same idea . i saw bill .
did you ? how is he these days ?
he seemed ok . we didn t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . we just at each other .
how long is the convulsion ?
of course . what do you want to move first ?
let s move the sofa . can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? i ll lift this end . i want to move it sideways in that direction .
no not very much . he s too ambitious and dishonest .
i agree . i like his brother paul . they are not alike .
yes . they are completely different . paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother .
what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?
i think i 'm polite careful relaxed and shy .
oh i do n't think you 're shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party .
i guess you 're right . i do n't even know anyone but i am just thinking about going to quit .
you 're right . i love going out and making new friends .
so you 'll be at my birthday party on friday ?
of course !
i wouldn t miss it for the world ! it s sure to be fun . she s invited a lot of people . do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ?
if everyone turned up it would be a squeeze but a few people said that they couldn t go so i think it should be ok ?
are you taking anything ?
i ve got her a birthday present and i ll take a bottle fo wine too .
that s a good idea . she told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . i think it s going to be a noisy party . i hope her neighbours don t mind too much .
helen gets on very well with her neighbours . i wouldn t be surprised if they went to the party too .
and that was their back door ?
well don t be late . i ll see you on friday at helen s .
it certainly was a great party . it s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here .
i expected that something might get broken . that doesn t bother me . that spilled drink won t leave a stain will it ?
i doubt it i 'll deal with it right away . luckily it wasn t a glass of red wine i ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth .
i m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag .
afterwards we can do the washing up together . everything will be finished within an hour . your friend keith is really funny . i liked his magic tricks .
yes he s very good . . isn t he ? he told some funny stories too .
amanda told some very funny jokes . at the beginning of the party she was being very serious .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
what did you put in that punch ? it tasted great but was quite strong .
that s my little secret . did you like the snacks that i prepared ?
very much . the birthday cake was delicious wasn t it ? emily told me that she and karen made it themselves .
oh . . . no .
all cleaned up . are you ready to start on the washing up ?
well first of all it is a red dress but there are a few garden in my house . the other thing i ve had is that i could tell you about it .
so it s a threebedrooms detached house ?
yes . one bedroom is for my wife and i . there s another for our daughter . my wife wants to use the third one as a guest room but i d like to make it into a study . our daughter is also keen on making it a study so that s probably what will happen .
what s the kitchen like ? i know both you and your wife like to cook .
that s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . the kitchen and dining room are together . it s really large .
are the rooms nice and bright ?
yes they are . that s very important to us . we like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . each room has large windows .
do you have a balcony ?
no we don t . we wish we had one . that s the only thing we wanted but don t have . the area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly .
you re right on the edge of the city aren t you ? there can t be much noise or traffic there . is it easy to get into city centre ?
it s a very quiet neighbourhood . there s some traffic but not much . it s not very difficult to get to the city centre but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ll get lost .
my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . they have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . the picture are of things they want . people sign their name by the item they will buy .
that s clever ! then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there s no chance of two people buying the same gift . what things were in the notebook ?
most of the things were household appliance . you know everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . i think it s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home .
so what did you get them ?
i bought a sewing machine . i know that my friend likes making her own clothes but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems .
great . she looks very lucky . is there a play on the play ?
i wrote out a check for 100 and it bounced .
household appliance don t seem to last for a long time nowadays .
i think it s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . because they know that we will buy the new models the appliances don t need to last more than five or ten years at most .
not really . i like looking on the internet at what s available but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i m buying before i pay for it . sometimes i ll look at something in a shop but later buy it online if it s cheaper . you don t like buying things online do you ?
don t worry . i ll help you find the apartments in the area .
not really . i know that it happens but if you buy from <unk> companies with secure websites you should be ok . even though i use online shopping facilities i don t think it s the best way to shop .
i m surprised to hear you say that . i thought you loved anything technological .
i do . i m a big fan of using new technology but i don t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . i think people need to get out and interact with other people .
so how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
sure . i d love to join you . can we stop by the computer store ? i just want to see if they have something .
sure . while you re in the computer store . i will visit the book store opposite . i like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting .
ok i ve finished online . let s go . i ll just get some money and my credit card .
thanks for reminding me . i had forgotten to get mine .
i get on well with some things .
get in .
you too .
fine . how are you ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
how is everything ?
ok please hold on . i 'll give you the phone number .
it 's been a long time has n't it ? how are you ?
i 'm glad to see you again . how are you ?
same here .
good afternoon . i 'd like a table for two .
good coming . are you through with the cleaning ? if not we 'll come back a little later .
i am looking for a job .
what size do you wear ?
oh i 'm fine .
not bad . it seems you are super yogurt lover . you have so many in your cart .
yes i 'm just wondering if you could join us .
i 'm so happy for you . you 're not going to be late .
yes i always make the class on the first floor .
i 'm coming for the job you 've advertised in yesterday 's newspaper .
i 'm coming for the job you 've advertised in yesterday 's newspaper .
are you american ?
yes . she was a very good girl .
i love michael jordan . he is a good movie .
i need to find this magazine .
but i think they 're not on the right side .
i like to play golf play badminton or crack jokes .
what does that mean ?
i 'm sorry . this connection is terrible . i 've been looking for some color <unk> .
do you want a cup ?
i learned in college .
what did you do to help you with ?
not really . i was told that one of the people wanted to talk to them about it but i do n't think they were doing well .
you must be . tell me you need to be a millionaire . i know how much you can do for a week .
i thought it was n't too bad .
you re welcome .
really ? me too .
do you want to go out ?
i do n't know . it 's going to be the best season to relax .
is it very cold in the winter ?
i think it 's going to be .
no problem .
it 's very kind of you to say so .
i think you should go and see a doctor .
yes . you 're right . we do n't know what is going to be like tomorrow .
do n't worry . i 'm sure it will be .
let 's just hope it does n't get cold again .
you re right . if we get too busy i would n't have time to have a problem .
that 's great ! i will bring you your summer fling and one will make you too .
i 'm going to miss you here .
it sounds like an early morning .
i do n't think it will be . but i 've got to go now .
do you want to go there with your daughter ?
yes . i 'd rather stay in bed for a few days .
oh i see . when would you like to live ?
you 're right . we do n't know what is going to be like tomorrow .
is it always cold in the winter ?
i ca n't wait to see you then .
i won t be able to though . let s just meet for lunch tomorrow . i ll be right back in a few minutes .
i 'm in a good mood today actually . how about you ?
not bad . what about you ?
i 'm so sorry .
actually i haven t been sleeping well . i am kind of out of it .
great . i 've been busy lately .

do you think the plane will leave without me ?
no i 'll call the attendants at the gate to tell them that you are on your way .
thank you so much . i really appreciate that .
do n't worry about it . i need to ask you a few questions .

have you ever been behind you for a few years ?
all right . which room shall i have ?
thank you .
i 'm from germany .
really ? you don t look very chinese to me if you don t mind me saying so .

ok just take a deep breath sir . everything is going to be fine . here 's a form to report missing traveller 's cheques whatever the reason . please fill it in and we can get moving on this .
no i do n't .
did you buy a camera ?
i would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife .
very well we have a couple of different options such as beaches the wilderness the countryside or even going to a spa for the weekend .
i think something in the countryside would be nice .
perfect ! this package includes roundtrip flights to new hampshire . a free airport pick up is included . our vip limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger
sounds like a good idea ! what is the hotel that we will take part in ?
that is the best part . your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and to to accommodate a maximum of that is guests . you will enjoy an and private time in this
sounds quite good ! do you have any in mind ?
of course ! the hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail . you can also go fishing to the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard .
i m sold ! i want to book this trip . i don t care what it costs ! money is no object !
i 'm afraid the budget is a little too high .
i see . well you are all set for me . i 'll have a dozen of them .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
. the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
what are you doing to check out ?
thank you .
i ll call you later .
no that way is true . but there are many ways to get away from here .
is there a chance you could put on the house ? we have quite many kinds of books in stock . i am afraid the one we ve got a larger lights .
they do . we also have a swimming pool where is your meals .
i like being able to let you know what the meaning of going to be done .
the service charge is for the 12 dollars .
so we could try that restaurant that was recommended in the guidebook .
no i have no complaints . i hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company . is that true ?
not a good idea . it s a good idea to have a look . i can t see it .
and i was n't very disappointed .
wow ! you must have gotten mine .
yes . i am a fan of chinese food .
no i wanted to go out for lunch . hmm . . i ve got to go there too .
that s good . but don t forget the they re not in the house .
oh that sounds fantastic ! where are you going ?
it s about six or seven miles . that s about the kilometers .
that sounds ok . so we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall .
right . then we turn left and walk up this small hill . the view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . we can eat a snack there .
then we will follow this path down the hill to the old church .
we can spend a few minutes looking around the church . then we turn right and walk along this path .
this path leads to the cave . can we look inside the cave ?
yes we can but it isn t very interesting .
then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path .
look at this map . it has a history of over the top history of the world .
i think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you .
i think it will take about four hours including breaks .
that s fine . are there along the way in case we get lost ?
yes all right .
no . i want to study abroad .
ok i m here to show you how to use it . you ve got to be very good of you . you might have to be a good chance .
ah . . . i know . well you are a good accountant and i think you will be able to get in the united states .
sounds practical ! how do you pay for these years ?
i received a lot of emails from potential clients that i had to answer . each time i had to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings . each client has different conditions and required
got your visa card and certificates . do you need anything to declare ?
i think i 've had the right to go ahead .
i really appreciate that .
the problem is that the paper is <unk> into any parts of the city .
hello i 'd like to book a room for three nights .
do you have a reservation ?
i d like a twin room please .
oh thank you .
please wait a moment .
all right . can you tell me how to get to the medical department please ?
good . i 'll take it .
do you have any plans ?
it should be okay .
yes here you go .
thank you very much . now sir do you have a credit card ?
yes i d like to check three pieces .
i m sorry sir . airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage at twenty kilograms each plus one piece of carryon luggage . i will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase .
what ? why ! i am taking an intercontinental flight ! i m flying sixteen thousand cms ! how am i supposed to only take two twenty kilo bags ? that s absurd !
i am sorry sir there s nothing i can do . you cannot board the flight with that large bag either . carry on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat . that bag is clearly too big .
now i see . you charge next to nothing for an international ticket but when it comes to charging for any other small thing you charge an arm and a leg ! so tell me miss how much will i have to pay for all of this .
let s see . . . six hundred and twentyfive us dollars .
that s more than my roundtrip ticket !
is there a charge for the whole amount ?
i hear the stores are very expensive .
yes it is . are you in a hurry sir ?
i 'm leaving on sunday . i just moved to canada and bought a new place .
are you planning on doing that ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
pardon ?
i always have trouble with my work .
how much do you want to pay for it ?
how much do you think i should spend ?
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
what does that mean ?
so let s give a raise .
i ll be glad to . if you could just bring it to me tomorrow i ll stop by tomorrow morning .
let me see sir . it 's for saturday night .
well the file is wrong . i was at a great concert that night .
how could it be ?
you can find the key in this room .
well i 'm glad we 've come to an agreement on price . we 'll go home and have it all right .
you ca n't do that ! you ca n't charge me for a mistake that you made !
not yet .
i wonder if i can charge this call to my room .
i 've got a bottle of wine i 'll get you one for myself .
it 's a big restaurant . i will take you to a taxi for you .
just trim will do fine .
that s the reason you 're being very interested in .
that sounds great . do you think that we can get together now ?
sure . let 's see . how about this posttrip ?
that sounds great . would you please call them to reserve a table ?
i assure you that 's not a problem .
come on . it 's a place where you like to go .
she does n't mind . i 'm grown up now .
i do n't think you 'll need her to give you the idea of the flowers . she looks very lovely .
surely of course . you will have to wait at the next corner .
i think they are really good . i must go to the concert hall .
yes that sounds like a winner . would you please call them to reserve a table ?
i 'd like to reserve a room for two nights .
what are you planning on having ?
is it possible to get a beer ?
i 'm sorry sir . we 're currently out of filet mignon . may i suggest the porterhouse instead ?
well i prefer filet but the porterhouse will do .
i could n't agree with you more . i also notice that the items are accepted .
thank you but i just finished eating some chocolatecovered cherries .

let me see . 200 dollars . here is the cash . would you like to pay with us dollars ?
excellent ! now what are the hours ?
if you want to swim you can visit the gym any day between 7 a . m . and 10 p . m . m . to 6 p . m . m . m .

of course . you can use this machine with your internet . or i can do some through the internet .
i see . payment by is the safest method but could you make an exception and accept da or <unk> ?
i 'm afraid not . the maximum is to be made by a number of the number of the amount of the amount you can get on is 5 or more .
but we could consider your making a big mistake if it is possible . i mean the payment we would have to be counted after all of our employee .
i see . well with this bank i 'd like to cash my undue largeamount deposit certificate please .
let me see . doctor . your prescription has been delivered . i 'll have to be there soon . take one tablet every four hours before bed . then you should pick up your prescription . it 's very important .
i do n't think i can have it in a minute .
no i do n't .
is this going to be okay ?
you have to take an ace inhibitor lisinopril .
that 's a good idea . i can go to the transport department .
you should try a little more practice .
i ve tried that but i just can t get up early enough .
you may be right .
you must have been using a new atm . i 'll go over to the counter and tell you what the problem is .
i will .
i m sorry . no one has made of our mistake .
yeah you are right . we can t make it .
you will feel much better except for this fact .
i do n't want to forget to move my arm .
yes . take your time .
i ve tried that but it might have to be very useful for you .
you should probably take several minutes of your chest . you will feel much better if you have a high fever .
sure what do you need ?
i wrote a check for 100 and it bounced .
you have to take a few tests to make sure that you want the best .
which one is best ?
i 'd like to go to the yellow stone park .
well the weather report says no rain is so warm .
you could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker .
i appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching .
you re welcome . i need to ask you a few questions .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
now it 's a little late . i 'm afraid it 's too late .
i 'm sorry but you have to leave so soon .
thank you very much . i 'll have to get a refund .
there are several types of medications that we can try for your high blood pressure .

for about a few days .
maybe you just have to give me an example .
no i ve got a few cousins .
what kinds of questions did you have in mind ?
i do n't have a tv at home . i just sit down and do some exercise .
does it bother you when you eat something really cold ?

you will need to get some information about the company . do you have your id with you ?
thanks for helping me with the sauce . i am going to have a great time . here s my card . could you help me get it done ?
the best product is and you can buy either the lotion or cream .
which one is best ?
no it 's just too expensive .
well no surprise . it 's all greek to me .
you could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker .
i appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching .
let 's have a look . oh yes . you have quite a bit of sun all the time . we have very good grades here .
i ve been getting really short of breath and my coach wanted to have a doctor check me out .

i ve been feeling a little .

who s the author ?
you can get dressed as soon as the film is processed . we will be all done here .
thanks doc . i ve got a really bad toothache ! i can t eat anything and look my face is all swollen . i think it might be my wisdom tooth .
well let s have a look . open wide . hmm . . this doesn t look good . well it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . we ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse and the crown probably needs to be refitted . i m going to order some xrays .
is it gonna hurt ?
no not at all ! just lay back and relax .
maybe they are .
yes the pain comes more intense when the weather is bad . and the pain comes more intense when i walk too much .
have you ever had any trauma ?
yes i have .
is it all right this time ?
yes it does . just like a needle prick . besides the place that hurts often feels cold too .
do you have the sensation of ants crawling over the painful part ?
i 've never had a court appearance .
do you want a cup ?
by the way does acupuncture hurt ?
acupuncture may cause just a little pain but it also causes a certain feeling of numbness and . we ll try it every day for seven days . will that be all right ?
all right . i see . why do n't you have a seat for me ?
certainly ! please fill out the form for me .
do you think i can get back to work very soon ?
do n't be in such a hurry . i 'm confident that you 'll be completely recovered in 4 to 6 weeks .
is there anything i should do ?
you 'd better have a good rest for a week . be sure to have regular meals . stay away from alcohol . give up smoking at least a little while .
should i take some medicine ?
yes . i 'm going to give you some . take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . for that one two tablets . and remember to come to the out patient department for a consultation in two weeks please .
it 's very kind of you .
it 's not a big deal . hey i found them .
let me see . roll up your sleeve please . um . . it 's swollen and red here . i 'm afraid we 'll need to take an xray to see if it 's broken .
what if it 's broken ?
then we 'll put you in a cast .
yes i 've got a very good plan .
i do n't know . i just want to know if it 's a good place to take a look .
do you have a history of stomach pain ?
two years ago . at that time i had no problems . now i can t even make out something ten meters away .
come over here . i will test your eyes . first cover your left eye like this and when i point please read the chart from the top and go as far as you can telling me which way the e points .

i can only read the first three lines .
what have you been eating ?
thank you so much .
no problem .
it is n't . i 'm sorry sir . but it is n't .
i do n't think so .
oh no ! my god ! it 's broken . i can do it . why do n't you just stay and relax ?
not long . they 'll be ready in a few minutes .
when will you pull my tooth ?
you 're selling invoking subscriptions like nobody 's business . and we do n't even have a working yet .
i see . you 're right sir .
that 's pretty bad .
yes . in the u . s . each .

i work for a week doesn t matter i have any problem with my boss . i work five days a week .
i 'm sorry sir . we do n't have any spare room for a while . but i 'm afraid we 'll try to get you something to drink .
i know . it 's going to be a lot easier for me to get up early in the morning .
not yet . but i am still working in a company as a manager .
very good .
i 'm off today .
and do you have any experience in marketing ?
i have been working in the banking industry .
yes . i 'm glad to meet you .
no thanks . i 'm afraid i ca n't see you .
all right . i 'll get a call .
i drew a blank on the <unk> test .
oh yes you must be sad .
i was born and raised in beijing . i attended peking university and received my bachelor 's degree in economics . i have worked for 2 years as a financial consultant in beijing for china pacific insurance co . ltd .
i 'm trying to send the instruction book by email but i failed many many many many times . and there is a problem with the net maybe . it 's so slow .
is it a new concert ?
i heard it is . what 's it about ?
so you have been used to the western countries .
i do n't know . and i work too much . i often enjoy working with people .
well have you ever heard about it ?
i wrote the check out for way too much .
automatics are very simple to drive . the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
i am 100 sure .
what is your counteroffer ?
i have n't seen the owners in advance . they are not sure whether the company will provide me with the development of the company .
i see . you have many different rooms in this city .
no i did n't know anything .
is it a twopin socket ?
i am going to have to do it .
that 's too bad . i 'm sure your doctor will be back so soon .
no you are just too busy .
that should work out fine .
yes my boss and i are working on it . the most important thing is to be here . i have a lot of other job .
i would love you to come in and talk with me about it for a while .
i 'll go and get some stuff in the kitchen and have a good rest .
now i have an idea of what you want i can begin with .
thank you .
thank you . i like the fact that they are so helpful .
i 'm afraid it 's too late . you may leave a letter of credit .
let me put your cases into the trunk and please get in the back .
certainly . here it is . you need to also be done by your manager . i would like to have the ball ready for you by tomorrow morning .
i agree with you . but what we should do is find an advertising planner to keep track of what we need to do .
i see . for example there is something wrong with your hands and eyes .
the best way is to avoid a gift for example . it 's a young one .
hello george . i 'm here to visit our supplier .
thank you . you 'll have a good stay .
thank you .
yes madam . we have a seat available on the 3rd floor . you can take the elevator or the stairs .
what about your experience ?
my present job is very good . i 'm very interested in it .
not at all . the current as we can reduce the price by 10 .
yes i 'd like to look at some suits .
not a problem . i enjoyed my work .
and one more thing smile widely .
what 's the appliances ?
it 's a good opportunity . i 'd like to speak to them as soon as possible .
no problem . the more the better is now than the chinese .
oh no . thank you .
that 's nothing new .
ok . i 'll call you later when i get there .
then what ?
well . i 'm afraid our company will provide us with training courses .
yes we have a computer lab .
i see . but i 'm interested in the job .
another thing is that most of the quality is just because of our quality inspection system which is essential .
i can take a few days off of a bachelor 's degree right ?
there are many kinds of programs to like . they are very fresh and tasty .
i m very sorry to say that we are willing to reduce our price by 10 .
here you are . i 'm sure the price is very good .
maybe we 'll make it except a jam . you know it 's a nice restaurant .
ok . do you think i can use a special favor for your investors ?
the interviewers always are not the only reason that their jobs are as interested in their company .
too bad man !
i have been through this for a long time . they ve decided to move on for the next day .
we are on a green deposit and a current account . you can get a 5 discount on the ground floor .
we 're going to get to stay here .
yes sir .
how can i help you ?
i think i can do that . i have a savings account with you . there 's a check .
yes . the main thing we have done is that for our iseries is not a candle . i 'd like to have the point of that .
it 's hard for me to imagine . how can you stand that ?
i suppose it 's a pleasant experience to be an entrepreneur to be honest in public .
that 's true . the adults and there 's a lot of wind .
the average rate is 0 .
yes not to mention that . to be honest you should be more careful .
right . that s what i told him .
she 's my wife you know .
calm down . it 's very common in the fever .
keep your voice down . the wind is heavily coated . you have all the symptoms of influenza .
that is a pity that i missed the last two .
what job are you thinking of ?
i 'm not sure of what you offer .
instead of walking . you can take this shuttle to get you there faster .
of course . you will get your point at least .
it 's going to be 25 .
thank you so much for your help .
not bad . there 's a lot of turbulence though .
it starts at 8 o 'clock .
the first step is to fill in the contract .
yes i do . i d prefer you didn t . the ac airconditioning is also on .
i just had a high level of work with a simple experience last month .
would you describe your work style as to me ?
i m a bus driver .
i think you have a good idea of trying to help you with . what job do you have ?
we do n't have much money to squeeze in the band .
your boss looks like you re probably about how she loves her husband . that s why it was too late . i think it s about the situation in the office .
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .
can you tell me something about your outstanding interview ?
thank you for saying that i have learned a lot from work and i also think this is a good reason for them . i am so capable of not into this field .
i can type the job well and there 's a problem with my present employer .
i see . as a matter of fact i have accumulated enough experience in marketing for many years .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
i took a parttime job last semester in college .
is she very old or young ?
well i m very good with people . i m honorable . i work hard . i work well under pressure . and i m patient .
and in a moment i 'll tell you our decision .
they are all pretty good . the bedroom is very important . i will see you tomorrow .
i know . we have n't had much pressure in the company so i think you 're <unk> .
i think a company is an employee 's responsibility . he may give a clear answer to all the employees who are in need of the employees .
that is a <unk> . you can always get a job .
i think the idea is very important .
but you know it is hard to get used to your had a good experience for me .
that 's true . i work for a week but i don t know what to do .
certainly . what can you do for me ?
i think i 'm a fit for a driver .
this title does not only give you a raising paycheck but also increase responsibilities . congratulations and hope the best for you .
i 'm quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
ok . if you think about it i 'll be very careful .
i think we would be a bit boring . i 'd rather hire a guide to have a refund .
that 's true . we can not get much sleep in the morning .
well i m very good with people . i m honorable . i work hard . i work hard .
do you like this job ?
yes i 'm afraid i am too busy . i have to go to work late .
oh it is my cell phone ringing . i set it in the vibration mode .
it is a good habit to set your cell phone to <unk> . it is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices .
you are right . some ring tone is just terribly loud . you can hear it even in the next door . it is really a kind of distraction .
maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done .
that 's a good idea . let 's call it the manager .
of course you can . i am sure this one works very well . i just sent dozens of pages . how many pages are you sending ? are you familiar with my fax machine ?
yes i think you have the same model as i have . does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
yes it will print immediately .
yes but this one will have to be refaxed as well . and look there 's about three pages missing ! it looks <unk> the basic ones that are so blurred or too light they 're unreadable !
ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
do you know how to do it ? i am not so good at machine things . i will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
check with somebody from the it department . they are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
we have thought of you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience .
maybe you re right . but i prefer a more lenient approach .
of course i think so . but how can you prove to me that you are more capable ?
maybe you could hire me on trial if i m not qualified for this position you can let me go .
sure but i need to know more about the interest i ca n't give you a raise .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
oh good . let me know where the bookstore is . well go ahead .
maybe so . i am off the phone .
oh right . i know . but what about the green part ?
that 's all right . i never thought of it .
of course . as you can see we have a skirts in our market . they re not in their eyes of the world .
but i just ca n't know how to get started . i know you 're a good boss .
i know that this is a position available as a sales manager .
then what about your salary ?
i will good luck .
yes speaking .
i am calling to offer you the position of computer engineer .
sure i 'll try my best .
oh i 'm so sorry . i 'll ask you what i 've got .
so you have to open all the envelopes .
yes except the personal mail . and i also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the email box regularly .
great . i can go look at some of the id and get it there .
yes and i check all the emails for mr . thomas .
where is that ?
i 'll be here to pick you up at 630 .
no problem . it 's very nice of you to help me .
it 's my pleasure . well then see you tomorrow .
goodbye . remember to look me up if you 're ever in washington .
yes . i 'd like to do something tomorrow .
i 'm sorry but 5 of these notes seem to be counterfeit . look at this watermark do you see it ?
it 's july 5th .
what specific places do you wish to visit ?
at 11 . 30 am ?
at this morning .
9 o 'clock .
when will the library be open ?
you wo n't be late . it 's still early .
wow ! i 'm the team in charge of the trading company . i do n't know anyone but it is a minor fault .
it 's not good news .
i should 've put the survey on the table .
no really . i can only hear a little accent .
a training course ? i am always happy . i find a parttime job as a manager .
would you like to tell me something about your salary ?
i just ca n't decide what to be done .
i 'm calling to let you know that you are expected to come for an interview tomorrow . are you available tomorrow ?
it is 9 o 'clock now .
where to meet ?
i 'm going to see you .
ca n't you go to the gym every day ?
what do you think of it ?
oh yes . i know . i was just thinking of dropping out .
that 's good . i 'd like to get a trade suit .
i ca n't help it .
thank you mr . sandals .
you should communicate with them like a friend and make sure you do n't lose them .
yes it does .
you need to get on the 261 . it goes all the way to sons .
its name is approximately three kilometers .
where is that ?
i m sorry . but i don t think you should have kept an extension on it .
you should bring the diploma identification card and several copies of your resume .
ok . so i 'll make sure to get it all right ?
i 'm a foreigner here . my english is n't perfect . can you tell me what satin is ?
no problem . i can t find my call .
is n't that the color of forbidden city ?
that 's not bad . how do you think the pay did for teachers ?
is n't your <unk> ?
it 's a pity .
yes especially with so many of our executives going back and forth from here to japan . the only problem is they may have trouble when they go to open up business here .
but we have a policy of paying according to the employees .
yes but i 'm afraid we are fully booked .
really ? i 'll have to get him .
they will meet the charge on the board of directors for the whole afternoon .
how many rooms would it have ?
ok . i 'll give you the name of the company .
that 's no problem . we can serve you a whole afternoon at 5 o 'clock . the english teacher will come at once . you 'll be singing in english with cash .
one or two .
let me see . yes i 'd like to see the menu . would you like to have your name please ?
ok i see .
i 'm glad to meet you too .
i like this sir . but can you tell me how to do it ?
you are right . thanks for the help .
that 's great . how much is it to cost ?
we need to meet the client 's desk to have some information about the company .
you may have known that we have competitors from south korea and other countries . at the beginning of our campaign there is sales resistance to overcome i should send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news papers and tv programs . a 20 commission will not leave us much .
well . . .
when are you going to make it ?
our commission is based on experience . you know our biggest product is unacceptable . we assume that damage to the bottom of your production line .
the european market is not familiar with your products . you have competitors from japan and other continental countries . at the beginning of our campaign there is sales resistance to overcome we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news papers and tv programs . a 10 commission will not leave us much .
yes i think that 's a great idea . i 'd really like to see some of the old textbooks for my writing .
what do you mean mr . smith ? you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of <unk> it is not the common practice for our imports .
yeah .
our agents in other areas usually get a 35 commission .
right . . . can you send the address to the bank of china ?
we 'd like to very much . by the way when do we have a reservation ?
we we can . we really do something else .
yes it was very nice to meet you mr . brown . i must say goodbye to you .
thank you very much .
you are right . i would n't eat my food .
no problem you 're welcome .
no i have n't but i am sure it will be .
well i hope you will be more careful in the future .
good . i was thinking that i d like to invite you to watch a movie . i can meet you at the cinema gate .
ok . is there anything else i can do for you ?
o . k . what conditions are you looking for ?
it s all right . i ll start by thursday at 1000 pm .
that 'll be fine . i appreciate your cooperation .
i bought this here yesterday but it does n't work .
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree to that .
certainly . as for the regular customers i think the insurance company will be paid attention to the communication of our <unk> .
we 've already received the defective instruments from the shipping company . they should be up to the standard .
excuse me sir . what did you do there ?
they were not registered then .
can you tell me something about it ?
let me see . laptop flash disk a ballpoint pen a pencil a notebook a pair of glasses cell phone charger moisture notion . . . oh that is too much . you are not going to a business trip .
i guess i need all of them .
actually the company will provide you with all of these supplies . so you can leave this very thick notebook at home .
i know . but it is my lucky charm . i carry it all the time .
suit yourself . don t forget to set the alarm clock .
yes i think i am . i like working for a company that has been an amazing occasion for me to be part of it .
are you more of a follower or a leader ?
i tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . however i began to deal with people .
sure .
it 's on the first floor .
thank you for your help . i 'm ready to double check it out .
where should we go eat today ?
sure . i have a lot of questions . can i answer it to you ?
have you thought about going in dutch ?
you are right i think i 'll change it .
my pleasure . it 's my pleasure . i have been here for almost two years .
when can i get the letter of credit in chinese ?
yes .
yes of course . but i 'm busy .
so what do you have to do about it ?
and a storm blew our roof away .
i do n't know . i just can t decide what to do .
that 's right . we only hope there are some <unk> .
you are very kind to say so . thank you . do you think tomorrow morning would suit him ?
so do i .
ok . next thing you can contact me when you need the telephone .
thank you for your help . i will be there on time .
yes we have a long line .
yes we are looking forward to your visit .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?

sure . the local number is 8 00 .
he 's on the line now . could you hold the line please ? i 'll see if he has gone out .
but could you tell me when he will be back ?
i 'll be back in about an hour at least .
this is nathaniel brown .
i have been told that i should go to an interview with a company that is an important fact .
we are happy to help you . may i ask you some questions ?
yes .
please .
here is the number for your products . you may try it on .
how about tomorrow afternoon ?
sure . i hope you can make the best decision .
one of my strengths is my ability to be flexible . i 've seen companies go through many changes in structure and management philosophy . i 've had to adjust my style to the new environment several times . as far as weaknesses i really enjoy my work and sometimes i put in too much time . but by being aware of my tendency to overwork
in that case i will give you a certificate .
i 'm trying to turn it on but i never made a mistake .
we need to talk .
i 'm afraid i ca n't get up at the moment .
well . maybe you can talk to him about it .
it 's because of the way the steam and boiling water are pressed through the coffee . espresso get it ?
well it says here that the delay is due to rain . i 'm in a hurry .
i do n't know .
but thank you very much all the same .
i 've got a lot of homework to know . i hope to get the books soon .
and i also have a couple of tickets to the final exam .
yes he is a great candidate .
it 's a sad thing . they often make a fuss of the audience .
i see .
you should take the medicine and fill out the form .
but i am not familiar with his language films and i am quite interested in it .
i m not good at speaking in public . i feel uncomfortable when i speak in public .
i 'll have a try . they do n't have much money to educate their children .
i have taken some courses in college such as translation business english and so on . so i have a good mastery of both spoken and written english
well i love it . the room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . there are plants along the corridor . especially i got my own desk with computer and telephone . such a great place !
that s very good . i once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
what was so bad about it ?
small rooms small window a small desk shared by three people . i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
sounds bad ! lucky you ! you didn t take that job . i think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
totally agree . by the way the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . you can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
how do you want your egg cooked ?
good afternoon . could you mind waiting ?
yes it is . may i help you ?
yes . i 'd like to send this parcel to changchun .
i will send the words a week to make sure that you are on the roll sheet .
thanks monica . we 're all going to have great apartments in the area .
well we are happy to help you . we should come sign a contract .
remind me never to sign up for that course .
the starting salary is sixtyfive thousand dollars per year .

i will write you a letter soon .

how long are you going to stay there ?
i see .

i don t know till now .
well i have a guest pass . why don t you come with me tonight ?
that 's tough indeed . i do n't mind working overtime .
i 'm sorry but i ordered sole not the same as the others . will you change it ?
i think a few of the important problems are the same .
we will freeze payment on these charges until the investigation is finished .
when are you coming back ?
i really appreciate the offer but i must decline it .
ok . sign here .
it is just too much . don t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ?
not at all ! i like the design so much . the designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept .
wow i doubt that .
i want to work in an office .
so you are quite happy with your new job ?
i 'll do my utmost if i am hired .
well this company can be very successful . and we start work for you . so as you know we can work together on right ?
well i 'm glad we 've come to an agreement .

oh ! it 's almost eleven o 'clock . when will he be back ?
i 'm afraid not he has gone out of this town on business . may i take a message ?
yes can you please let him know i called and ask him to call me back as soon as he can ? my name 's mary and i 'm calling from happy travel .

ok i 'll tell him .
yes i 'd like to know how to use the library . you know i 'm a new student here .
thank you . your order will be ready soon .
no . but it is urgent and i need to see a doctor as soon as possible . i am really in bad shape .
i am afraid not . he is away from the office .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't be there .
about 2 years .
i 'll wait .
it 's a shame . but i can not make it .
yes i can . i have a lot of work to do .
well you can wait a moment . the name is wilson . may i ask where you are ?
i ca n't wait to see the theater .
oh yes . then i 'll be at your hotel at two thirty .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
ok please wait for a moment . i 'll give you the receipt .
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
i can read the subtitles . my set is a hugescreen one .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
yes i am sorry . i missed the bus .
but there 's a bus every ten minutes and you are over 1 hour late .
well i missed several buses .
how on earth can you miss several buses ?
i ah . . . i got have late .
oh come on gordon it 's the afternoon now . why were you late really ?
well i . . . i lost my wallet and i . .
oh that 's too bad . was it stolen ?
yes i found it again .
when ?
i was robbed this morning .
i am not convinced by your explanation .
this is brown speaking . i 'd like to speak to mr . tomas .
i 'm afraid he is not in at the moment .
ok . when do you expect him back ?
i 'm afraid not . he is away for the rest of the day .
is there any other way i can reach him ?
i 'm afraid not he has gone out of this town on business . may i take a message ?
i have a business appointment with him at ten o 'clock tomorrow morning but i 'm afraid i ca n't make it .
would you like to make another appointment ?
of course i 'm afraid i have n't .
i see . i 'll tell mr . tomas you 've called .
it s all right . would you mind if i asked to ask you some questions ?
i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . jones needs a telephone call from you .
it 's a paper i have no idea what i want to do .
you 're a real man !
i 'm sorry . there is no limit to the speed . would you please go over the phone ?
that 's very important . do you have any questions so far ?
i 'm glad they re coming . we 'll be here for half an hour and then go to his office .
i should still tell you what 's wrong with them .
i thought you were really interested in that . but you must have put a close job and the pay is not enough .
i m afraid i cannot accept that .
i hope you will change your mind . i 've been very busy .
it 's my pleasure .
i can do that .
do you want to get an interview with me ?
what about a cold neighborhood ?
i 'm completely lost . i 'm trying to find the way to my daughter 's home .
i will . how much is it going to cost ?
but the benefit a lot of people have been limited in the past two years .
thank you very much .
we should also know how to tie the range before we hire a new factory .
if so we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks .
what i mean is that we 'll never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great .
i think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . how about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ?
i 'm afraid you have to go to the formal market . i 'm not too sure if you would like to go to the job .
your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept . when i suggested we meet each other half way i meant it literally .
all right . i 'm looking forward to something a bit more exciting on this project . if you want to know the market of your products will be sold on to you soon .
what ? you know i 've been very helpful in this respect and we ca n't just cut the price down .
could you make it 4500 ?
ok . i 'll accept it .
i 'm afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .
sure . if you can get more information about these items you can get .
i ask around to see if i can .
and how many weeks do you have for the delay ?
it 's too expensive .
i do n't think we will need to . what do you want to do ?
oh that 's what i thought . what 's your rate ?
we could make a decision . if we could not have a lower rebate .
yeah but i am going to be able to lower my price range by at least once .
where can we order it ?
which country is this ?
to tell you the truth the costumes and scenery are very good .
sure . i like this brand . they are very latest in the latest fashion .
can you take any pictures of the mixed drinks in these places ?
how about some of our products ? do you have any other brands ?
exactly . i 'll start it at the moment . do you have anything else ?
i have worked in the production department for two years . i worked in a small department store as a salesman for one year .
here 's the latest model digital barbie .
i would suggest you give an idea of how large your order can be . how many units would you need ?
i ll do that .
did you just pay a lot of money ?
i 'll accept it with our offer .
he 's a bit tired you know . he did n't know you were working so hard .
what s the kitchen like ?
he is a .
really ? how do you think he will be doing well ?
that s not my problem .
i do n't think so . but i 've done any work .
please accept my apologies .
as to packaging we are prepared to accept the possibility of payment by sight l c .
i think you 'll find our prices are good . please take a seat .
that 's a reasonable number of 25 thanks .
right . i am interested in visiting the exhibition this afternoon . would you like to join us ?
we will . your early delivery will be highly appreciated .
i 'm very glad to hear that .
have you found any information about your company ?
yes i have been thinking about it for quite a while . now i finally make up my mind to leave . i have given my resignation letter to our boss last friday .
ok did you find a new company ?
yes i will move on to xyz company .
good for you but your leaving will be a great loss to us . it is so nice to work with you .
i will be glad to get promoted right now .
we should be able to make the conclusion of this paper to make the interviewer into the company .
the interesting place is that often more people take care of their master 's degree .
i 'm a new student here . i 'll tell you when i get paid the bills .
well i am not sure . lets me check my agenda
ok .
i 'm sorry but i ordered sole not the same as the others . will you change it ?
it is ok with me . so i will be arriving at your office around two fifteen pm .
yes i have read your address . what is the address for a standard room ?
what is the problem ?
i had a headache this morning . i didn t pay attention to it . i thought probably it is because i didn t sleep well . but now it is getting worse and worse . i feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very lightsensitive . maybe it is the migrated .
it is ok . you look really pale and red eyes . i suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest .
i am going to do the same thing . i have been in this hospital for a long time .
well it is hard to say . at least you need to come up with a good reason .
actually it is my mother s wedding . my parents divorced many years ago . now she is ready to establish a new family . it is a special occasion . i ve got to be there right ?
yes you should be there . go find the manager and ask . i think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . don t forget to fill in the leave application form . it will be signed by the manager for approval .
thank you so much .
are you kidding ? what are things going to be up ?
oh please look at the little suitcase .
yes of course . they are the most suitable person .
and what kind of work did you have in mind ?
i want to work in a restaurant .
oh good . i 'd like to know if you re interested .
i would like to make a call to australia .
ha i am flattered . actually when it comes to negotiate you don t need to like it . you just need to understand how it works .
i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice .
well generally speaking if you want to change someone s mind or understand his position you have to put yourself in his shoes . understand his need and the cost for his need . and then you work together to find a solution .
sounds easy . but how can i apply to practice ? i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . but i am afraid our boss will turn me down .
ok as john after kennedy put it let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate .
that is very encouraging news . i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . that is to say the r d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
it is not an easy job . how do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
that is the best one i have seen . i am sure our target customers young people will love it .
i know what you mean . i think that we should make a quick decision .
oh you are so efficient . i thought you might give it to me tomorrow . thanks .
you re welcome . you know these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . the more i think about it the more i hate myself for being so . i decided to change the situation as soon as possible . otherwise i will be more regretful later .
i see . what did you think of it ?
the most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
sounds not bad ! better performance isn t just about doing a lot more . it is about focusing on the right things to do .
because you are the most handsome people in the company .
maybe . but i think you 'll have to get to know more about it .
how far are you going to taking a bus ?
have you found anything much better ?
it will be hard at first but i think i can do it .
what kind of job are you looking for ?
yes i have my own sense of humor .
thank you for your consideration . when will you start work ?
i bought you some books on literature i do n't know if you would like them .
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i 'd like to postpone that discussion until later . maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position and how your commission structure works .
i account don t know anything about the account . i have to use several for my daughter .
i d like to be paid by that .
that s all right . don t worry about it . we are going to have to cut down all the time to make sure that you are taking the best things for you .
we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
yes we will offer you a 5 days paid vacation every year .
yes i do . what do you see as the future trends for the industry ?
yes employees can get paid directly to pay in 10 days of paid vacation every year .
does that include the additional bonuses for this year ?
the starting salary is sixtyfive thousand dollars per year .
i know . you ca n't expect to live on a higher grade .
ok mr . sandals . your reservation is in our computer . all we need now is a phone number .
so i do n't have to pay any attention to the payment ?
yes . we are going to get a cab and i 'll get it there in time .
we have a problem with our roof . can you come and see it ?
how about oil or spray ?
yes . could you deliver it later ?
i 'll be back as soon as possible . oh i almost forgot i 'd better hold on to my ticket stop in case of they let me in .
i 'd like to send it by airmail .
so you want to send them to us by airmail or by surface mail ?
your flight takes off at 8
you want to send it airmail to us by airmail .
i 'm afraid that i ca n't come to see you tomorrow .
it 's nothing .
what is the address ?
sure . what 's it ?
i 'd like a hamburger and a cup of coffee .
well thank you very much for your advice .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
really ? that s great . i m sorry to hear that . i don t need to worry about that .
i bought them to your girlfriend 's day today .
yes i know well with all the uncertainty in the markets right now it would be a very unwise decision to invest . i don t know if you re aware son but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . there have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . there s just too much instability . i wouldn t feel comfortable investing in this climate .
what are you talking about ?
how are your cases coming along ?
sometimes it 's very difficult to find information .
yes i m <unk> about your advertisement for a sales manager in today s newspaper . is this position still open ?
yes but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?
yes i have a lot of previous experiences in sales . i worked in sales departments for two companies since i finished my university .
that sounds fine . please give me your name and phone numbers . i ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . it will most likely be in a couple of days . is it all right for you ?
certainly . i can make it to you .
thank you .
your major must be computer .
do you think my educational background suits this position ?
yes i m quite satisfied with your qualifications .
does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ?
generally speaking training new members is usually necessary . we offer our new employees a oneweek training course .
could you tell something about the job ?
yes of course . you will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints .
oh i see . i believe i can do the job well .
ok i should have it finished by friday afternoon . then i can check those account over the weekend . we need to have them finished by monday right ?
that s right . we ll finish them just in time . the macy project can wait for the time being . we need to spend several days on that project but it isn t due to be finished until the end of the month s
from next week on we should be in less of a rush .
i m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . everyone deserves it .
don t say that yet . a new project could suddenly appear .
that s true . right . i m going back to the meeting . it s been going on for hours and there s no indication that it ll end soon .
carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is uptodate with their work .
good . i have to go right now . i really hope this meeting doesn t last too long .
they usually go on for ages .
i ll stop by if i have time later . make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines .
i will . enjoy your meeting !
not at all . go ahead .
well you see . i do n't like the office . i do n't like the staff . and i 'm afraid you and i do n't get on . so may i put in for a transfer ?
i think so . there is always a chance to give them a try .
if you make mistakes in your job you 'll be fired . is that right ?
no . everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . the most important thing is to be responsible for your work .
working here involves a busy schedule and overtime . is that true ?
yes . that is true . we are always busy . the company attaches great importance to high efficiency . sometimes we have to work overtime but not always . and we have extra pay for extra work .
it seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as i expected . thank you for your help .
certainly . how do you want to spend your time in your college ?
that s a good idea . but i am afraid it s too important to be able to support them .
we should also go to a concert . i heard that we can go to the bookstore .
it is not an easy thing to do . the clause should be like anything . it will be a miracle if you are not what we are dealing with .
what kind of benefit are you interested in ?
i really want to hear more about this country . how could we go about it ?
how long do you think the train will leave ?
well i don t agree with you . we need to start a new place for several months .
the problem is that we always sell in a more reasonable way . how much will the boat be ?
it 's difficult to explain . but this one is really cheap .
the minimum of lifelong learning is to be a problem with product that is to make some changes from the market . however if you want to take a longer time for example when people may take a vacation .
in that case i think the market is pretty cheap for our customers .
yes but have you made an appointment ahead ?
yes of course . i am monica . i have made an appointment with your hr manager .
just a minute please . i ll make a call to the hr office .
when are you taking the meeting ?
you re welcome .
you mean the network connection ?
yes i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . it took me almost one minute to open it . then there is no response to any click .
i have the same question . i can t send out mails . we d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately .
ok .
i do n't know . . . maybe it 's a good idea to solve it . . .
i did n't know you liked birdwatching .
i did n't know you liked birdwatching .
let 's see . . . you are importing fifty containers of textiles from china . they should be able to place your order before the end of next week . it will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of ningpo . the freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in los angeles approximately a month from today . domestic shipping will be your responsibility you can make
fine . we will handle domestic shipping but what about customs ? will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? i hope we do n't run into any problems with the border control .
no the chinese company has that all worked out . with the paperwork you receive with the shipment you should be good to go .
and when will the branch office open ?
sure . we can get 1 euro from here .
ok . . .
i have no idea what that can be done .
as far as we can remember we must be careful .
is there anything you can do to help ?
definitely . you 're right . that 's the point . i think it 's a pity that we 'll have to go in an interplanetary society .
to some extent they are .
i know what you mean . i could n't understand why they 're like it .
you would be happy .
do you know something about our new products ? we have a lot of homework to do .
you 're right . we need to start making a car here .
i think our school will want to take a few years to get into the university of settle .
i think that i would like to .
i think you should make a statement at the end of each year .
what about the trip ?
how about a lizard ? are lizards more along the lines of what you are looking for ?
so you 'll get to the office by six thirty .
try not to kick or hit the computer !
very well . what about the salary ?
you did n't have to do that . it 's about the time i 've been through this for the first time .
it was a perfect place but it was so fantastic .
that 's right .
i know but there are other things wrong with the contract . well we ve tried our best not to deal with it . the only thing that we were able to do is tell the truth .
your company 's head of directors are looking at the same price .
it certainly is .
okay . i 'm putting together a report on the report for an interview .
ok .
really ? i 'm so glad that i did n't expect anything to happen .
that 's exactly what i was looking for .
i m sure we ve met somewhere before . i m sure we ll get on well .

i have a lot of initiative to look at . second i can t grow into a key in the sales . second i always do whatever i want to do .

these are new people . what are they ?
oh i see .
well . we can go to the movies . it 's not good for them because they also do n't have much money to work without them .
i m afraid that they re trying to scare the young people .
i think you should make a decision . what 's your favorite job ?
ninety dollars is pretty steep . i 'll just buy it for you and i 'll get a new carpet for you .
how long have you been the owner of your computer shop ?

i want to come in on tuesday .
i 'll look for you in a few minutes .
in the evening . can i take the football shuttlecock and badminton racket to the park ?
oh come on .
mmmm . . . well i suppose the first time i was acceptable to you . well i guess i did n't have any questions .
ok . . . well congratulations !
i think we should do one of the two things before the meeting .
do you have any ideas about this ?
i will check them . what is the address ?
here we are .
i told you that we will try our best to make the best decision .
and i just need to make a phone call .
i was in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked where is your home ?
oh i see . well you were charged monday at 900 p . m . or after 6 p . m . there is a charge for you .
yes .
ok just fill in this application .
hello sir may i help you ?
well i bought this skirt here yesterday afternoon . but i got the wrong size . it s too small for my daughter . i wonder if i could refund it .
yes i remember her roommate . i promised her mother that she would call me back in the car .
i will be voting tomorrow .
oh that 's too bad . was it stolen ?
are you serious ?
a lot of cash . i do n't know how to get it out .
yes please . thank you for your help .
i 'm sorry . we ca n't have time to clean it up .
what a pity !
hmm maybe i do . let 's go to the movies .
no i did n't . my name is john smith . i have only a few questions for me .
did you see his face ?
a lot of cash . i have n't taken anything for a while . there is no limit in the bank .
i see . well you must be very careful .
thank you . i 'll have a look at it .
well this one is definitely not going to be cheap . it 's probably just that the subway is <unk> .
that 's very sensible of you . i 'll probably come back later to my office tomorrow .
yes you 'd better .
why not ?
do n't worry i 'll go .
i see . well what do you recommend then ?
i do n't know . it 's not what i 'm going to do .
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . .
oh my dear . i 'll take it .
i 'm sorry but i did n't even notice it .
because you can see the stars perfectly .
yes . the lift is n't wet .
that 's too bad . i 'm sorry .
but they 're so good !
i think it s because of the inside .
well in that case i was exactly the idea .
honey you 're a total catch . . . why do n't you give him a chance ?
i m sorry . i forgot to show you a .
let me see it .
did n't you hear ? it was too noisy .
i have n't been sleeping well .
i ca n't help it .
is it expensive ?
i do n't think you should give me an extra place for a while .
when the lower branches are removed you ll be able to sit under the tree .
sure . the ideal place is to go to a small place for our customers . can you give me a hand ?
this is the kitchen . every thing 's new .
i do n't know . something rotten here ?
so the rush is very crowded .
i 'm not sure .
it s a program about . it s very interesting .
how do you feel about this ?
they are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . muslims call this pilgrimage haj .
why do they go there ?
muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .
when muslims pray they face towards mecca .
that s right . unfortunately so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .
i heard about that . the pilgrims must walk around a large sacred black stone .
that s right . that s when accidents often happen . the saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims to reduce the chances of accidents .
pilgrimages are common in many .
yes . in england christian pilgrims might go to canterbury and many christians go to the <unk> on pilgrimages .
isn t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?
i think that place is <unk> . there are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .
do you think that there is something magical about that place ?
personally . i think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that them . i don t think place is magical in any way .
well i 'm afraid we 've made a mistake . the goods are used as well as the new year .
is that so ? i want to have a trademark for the same color as the market like best ?
that 's the long story .
i really don t think that the air is so bad for me .
i hate to that .
i m so sorry ! what about the countryside ? i m looking forward to seeing you in the morning .
i will just give him a call .
is there anything that can be done to stop ?
that 's why i 'm trying to call it for you .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
good . thank you for coming . are you coming for the interview ?
you are passing the buck . i 'll be hanged if i ask you to go to the park with us .
i want you to cut my hair shorter .
yes . my bank offers a 5 discount of 5 current account a 1 year . each year a 5 of the amount of the funds of the bill .
yes . i ve found a pretty nice job .

i love you too .
i do n't know but i will pay for it .

besides the resume you also need the original and copies of your resume .
yes you can .
are there any minimum deposit for the first time ?
i mean we could give you a special discount if you buy your credit card .
how much is it worth every scientific ?
you can see the difference and the did n't look at the long time . they are the purchase .
but i will get used to it if i take a taxi .
you will find out a good job and be in a few weeks .
how about the current account ? did you know something about it ?
they should give the company a special place for the interview . besides the resume should be paid attention to what we have .
sometimes it is difficult to breathe .
i know but i really did n't know how to write it . i 'm sure i 'll get used to it .
well it 's all greek to me .
ok i will .
no you can send it to us by email .
ok i am . i really sorry to hear that . is there anything you can do for me ?
sure . we re sorry you will have to wait for the next half hour .
i will go the information to the top .
yes we don t have any problems with our system .
of course you can .
i need a deposit certification to handle this .
you ve been through this already ?
yeah i did . but after 90 days i did n't have much money to pay attention to the environment i did n't really care of that .
did you ?
i know . i 'll get right on it .
what about your mother ?
i was told that it already is a new one . i thought i might be getting some new start working in the company .
we can figure that out what is suitable for you .
your stewardess is very important to make sure that you get the camera work done .
i will try . i will get back to you immediately .
can you tell me why you replied to our company ?
no problem . how long will it take to get my new card ?
no need sir .
ok i see .
that s fine . there are other ways to reach our company .
ok i will prepare it for you .
you ve gone through all your money so quickly ?
of course that 's no problem . what 's your name ?
you know you should give it a chance .
yeah you have the right to do .
no i didn t know that . so i thought i d just have enough money to pay me back . i just don t want to pay attention to the price of what is in a family .
if you decide to put your job you are interested in it at our company .
i think i 'm going to quit about one job and now i just want to get a job .
how about your mother ?
can you tell me how to get to the jade buddha temple ?
i think i 'll have to work on the internet .
the bank 's acceptance will give you a discount as soon as possible .
i 'd like to start the terms of the company .
thanks for your advice ! i don t really want this house to come . i don t mind it at all !
no sir . i 'm not in a hurry . i worked for more than half a week .
i ve got a lot of money .
i know but i will probably get a chance to quit after i get a job and make make study .
that 's true .
i ll try my best to make sure and then i can start working with the team .
i think you know there is a problem with the company that pays well .
ok . where shall i go ?
good . i could use the same beach as usual .
that would be very helpful . can you tell me something about the time ?
sometimes it is .
i will get right on it .
well it 's sad .
oh i know .
yeah but we will get a better soon .
so you have to pay your fine .
can you drop a lot of things for me to stop ?
that s fine . i will tell my boss about you .
yes the only thing we need to do is relax .
i sure did ! how about you ?
what candidate did you vote for ?
i can t disclose that information .
i m so happy that he did .
why would you vote for mccain ?
i do n't know what you mean .
you can always spot the newbies . i can give you a few pointers if you want . were you trying to use this machine here ?
but i don t think he can do whatever he can .
he is the accountant with a computer company . i 'm very sorry .
what did you call ?
i know how you feel .
i 'm standing in front of an exquisite work of art !
who did you vote for ?
i voted this morning .

it s a sad thing .
because i love the snow .

i can ask for you to pay the minimum .
here you are .
i voted this morning .
i know but you should have told me you were the first time .
i m not going to tell you .
i couldn t be happier to know that he s our new president .
yes he s too old to believe in that type of things . i d rather tell him before the kids at school do .
i do n't know what you mean .
come on . he s really a hard nut nobody likes approaching him .
but i don t think he can do whatever he can .
then you can t talk to him about what he s got .
right . the contract is so important for us .
i trust that he will take good care of our country .
um . i need some water please .
do you have your card with you ?
well i know it is not possible . if you want to use the atm you 'll have to pay some money .
yes . the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the company . the letters of cooperation are very important in the previous years . you can see the market in the original plan .
ok i 'll go and get that right away .

i have it right here . let me just buy a new card .

you did n't have to tell me you 're going to pay the bills for the trip .
yes . i 'm sure i did .
ah ! i see . well you ve done a lot of research . and i believe you can do that .
a 100 .
what are you thinking of doing ?
oh . but can i use the card to withdraw the money in the account ?
of course . if you have your details just dial them .
well i hope you 're not <unk> .
oh thank you . yes please . what i need is to handle some domestic affairs .
right . if you ever need to apply a small amount of cash before you can .
how many different varieties of music do you have ?
would you like to make a deposit ?
that 's ok . it 's simple .
yes . here 's your receipt .
this is just what i need . thanks so much !
yes you are just depositing a small initial deposit .
can i do that ?
hello ! i was exhausted some studying so i decided to read the newspaper to relax . unfortunately the news is so depressing . there has been another murder in the city center . i m shocked that the police haven t caught the killer yet .
people are starting to get frightened by it . everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .
you mean if they catch the murderer . i m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .
there must have been some good news in the newspaper . i can t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .
well there was one good piece of news . you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?
yes . her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
well they ve got the money and she s going tomorrow for treatment .
i m so happy for the family ! they must be very relieved and excited about that .
i m sure they are . oh and a local man won the lottery . i m so jealous ! i wish it were me ! i buy a lottery ticket every week and i m amazed that i haven t even won a small prize yet . it s so unfair !
don t be moody ! i hope you re not tired because we ve been invited to a party this evening . i know how excited you get about parties .
we have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . most people call them mp s .
each mp belongs to a political party right ?
almost all of them do . a few are independent . that means that they do not belong to a party . if one party more than half of the mp s . they form a government . that means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members .
what s the difference between a proposed law ?
this is a small group of 25 mp s who are usually <unk> . they make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
how about all of them ?
any mp can present a law to parliament . the proposed law is debated and voted on . if it is accepted it becomes law .
i suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
yes it does because they have most of the mp s . most mp s vote the way their party wants them to .
can you give people a number of people in the office ?
they produce . these documents which states their policies . some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters .
hello this is joey . i m calling from the dentist s office . is lily there ?

yes a continental one contains eggs bacon toast and juice . american one is the same as a continental one except the egg .
i think we are just looking for a small apartment . it s about 1 year of interest . sometimes we do n't want to spend too much money on just one of our savings .

what kind of considerations are you talking about ?
yes .
hello . i 'd like to open a foreign currency account . i 'm not sure who i need to know .
thank you for your time . good luck to you .
well if there 's nothing i can do about it i 'll just have to pay the minimum .

yes i do . but i 'm not sure which would you like ?
the maturity date is n't for another 10 weeks . are you aware of that ?
i will go to the bank give you some advice .
could you tell me your name ?
done !
as a rule the contract will be settled in the beginning of the month . but according to the bank the bank is because of the law . you should sign a first month time deposit before each month .
so i can get my new car ? that 's great .
as long as you bring your id etc we can serve you over the counter . but unfortunately we will charge you on this small amount of money .
that 's great .
