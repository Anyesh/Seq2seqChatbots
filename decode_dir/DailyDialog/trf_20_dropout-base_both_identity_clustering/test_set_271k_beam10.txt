you are right .
sir when i deleted the 10 the program automatically added a 2 service charge .
how much do we have ?
what ? who does that mean ?
yes ! i thought it might be .
you said you were going to window shop !
she asked me about it .
oh sounds great . why do n't you try it ?
i do n't know . she said she was a good girl .
is n't that the way to make it ?
i did n't have it .
cool down harry ! what are you really mad about ? did you get ripped off ?
yes . last sunday i went to a nearby market . it was on <unk> fair . i chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot without even trying to strike a bargain . i paid one hundred and twenty . and just
is that so ? i am afraid people will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . it 's the norm of free trade . the seller sets
i 'm afraid not . but i ca n't believe it .
of course that 's something really irritation . and the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . i recommend you to consult the price tags in the superb

i guess you 're right . i 'll just have to go to bed early .
you see ? we have already arrived .
you look so fast .

i go to bed at ten and get up at six .
that 's helpful for your health .
that 's what we should do .

i heard that . thanks a lot .
let 's go !
who would you like to talk to ?
yes . can you have her call back later ?
o . k .
80 yuan .
here it is . and how much is it ?
sorry . i 'm afraid we do n't have this color in right now . we need a new size 8 .
i 'm so glad that i helped out .
this is supposed to be your vacation we 'd like you to just relax .
cooking makes me feel relaxed . so what are we cooking ?
ok well we 're going to make a pan of lasagne a salad and some garlic bread . here 's the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?
sure . we should probably preheat the oven right away too .
that 's a good idea . can you set the oven to 200 degrees celsius ?
that 's a bit high for lasagne . i 'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there .
fine . i 'll just get out the casserole dish the <unk> the salad bowl and the baking sheet .
you know i could do this myself .
i do n't think it 's broken .
well if it 's not broken then you need to learn how to vacuum better because it does n't look like you 've vacuumed for ages !
fine . i 'll go vacuum . let me know if you need any other help .
yes . but you know where to go .
do you let me know where to get off ?
you have to go to the national park avenue .
thank you . please get back to work .
take your time .
thank you i will .
it 's a fortyfive minute to an hour ride .
how much does it cost ?
you 're welcome . i hope you 'll be more comfortable in your new room .
of course . is the dinner still on ?
yes i was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .
we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .
that 's what i thought you would do . listen i live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . it 's just down the street from all the bars . you probably do n't want to be walking around after dark .
it ca n't be that bad .
i wish it was n't but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .
really ? i never would have guessed . the criminals must only come out in the evenings because i 've never noticed anything strange when i 've been at your house in the daytime .
do me a favor and take a taxi . it 'd make me feel a lot better .
ok we will . how do you get around in the evenings ?
when i first moved in i walked everywhere . but within a week i had my purse stolen just a block away from the police station ! now i always take public transportation .
has anything else happened to you ?
nothing else has happened to me but i have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close .
well we 'll be careful . thanks for letting me know .
really ? what s the problem ?
are there many accidents in the city every day ?
you ca n't miss it .
that 's true .
that 's pretty bad .
how about meeting a taxi ?
it was my pleasure . if you have a good idea do n't be afraid to speak up .
my colleagues quickly get promotions while i always get sidelined . i do n't know what to do anymore .
i am worrying about you .
i love doing it with me .
then may i see your ticket ?
i believe that i did get hurt .
do we need any water ?
why do n't you call them ?
what happened ?
they 're incredibly selfish . whenever they go to the park they do n't have enough time to waste .
yes sir . may i help you ?
where to sir ?
yes ma 'am . when would you like to go there ?
thank you . you helped me a lot .
we can wait a few minutes to get there .
that 's wonderful . thank you .
no problem . do n't worry the taxi is faster than the bus .
you wo n't be late .
you know i hate shopping more than anything else in this world .
i know . but we could get some exercise in and we could get some errands run too . windowshopping won t cost you anything .
what kind of errands do we need to run ?
well we could go to the newsagent s to pick up the sunday paper go to the butcher s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner and to the chemist s to pick up your prescription from the doctor .
i ll only go if we can stop at the <unk> to pick up something to drink for tonight .
fine . we ll do that tonight .
sounds good . you have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . i know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms especially if the stores have special offers .
i promise . we re only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven t had time for .
ok let s go then .
at the zoo wow ! this zoo is really huge .
no . i don t have to pay cash .
some of my grappa will cure your shyness .
you said you were only going to window shop !

i was just thinking about someone i went to school with this boy i was quite friendly with in third grade . we used to hang out together he lived next door but then my parents moved and i changed schools and never saw him again .
i beg you pardon ?
video tape breaks down after fifteen years . so if he collects a lot of tapes after fifteen years they will all start to rot .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
it says no smoking .
sorry i 'm very near sighted .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do it again .
try to be more careful in future .
how can i solve it ?
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> .
i am not surprised you eat too much .
and i suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office does n't help .
no i would n't think so .
i do wish i could lose weight .
well why do n't you go on the diet ?
i 've tried diets before but they 've never worked .
perhaps you should excercise more . why do n't you go to an exercise class .
yes maybe i should .
that is just an excuse . you can always find some time to exercise .
but i work hard all the time for long hours . often i have no time for lunch . yet i am still getting fatter .
bill you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . and skipping meals will not help you lose weight . in fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals .
i know you 're right but what can i do ?
how about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ?
but i 'll miss the news . it 's important in my business to keep up with events in china .
i know i know . have you got a portable radio ? you can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time .
uh . . . yeah ! you 've never had the first time .
just calm down .
what specific duties would you like ?
i really like the kitchen .
well we have some ice cream .
we 're scared .
ok . i ll try them .
mom what are you talking about ?
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
well i swim and run every day .
now tell me what do you eat ?
well i do n't eat any meat but i do eat fish and eggs .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
oh yes and fruit i love fruit .
what do you drink ?
well i never drink alcohol coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
what do you drink ?
you too . have you lost some weight ?
yes i took off 4 kilos . i am glad you notice it .
not some crazy diet fat i hope .
no no i just changed my eating habits . i eat a balance meal . and i eat less than before .
sounds reasonable .
ah yes that 's cool .
hello madam . what 's the matter ?
hi this is rose .
do you have the starting salary ?
if you don t mind me asking .
no thanks . i have had enough .
actually you have n't had much .
to tell you the truth i am on the diet .
that sounds ridiculous . why ?
well i am gaining weight these days and i have to watch my calories .
no do n't try to tend me . i 'm becoming chubby and i have to slender down .
come on . i do n't think you 'll like it .
i do n't think so . i know i 've put on weight this winter .
so you are watching your weight are n't you ?
yes to tell you the truth . i am on the diet .
where are you heading now ?
i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road . it is very close to your house .
is that the university next to the teachers college ?
i don t know . but it is .
well i 'll see . sometimes the stores do n't have some of the new kinds of cereal .
yeah . if we share the cab it 'll be cheaper . besides that your chinese is better than mine . the drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though i practice my pronunciation carefully .
well . don t worry about it i will be happy to share the taxi with you .
it 's by the oatmeal and breakfast bars .
all right . it 's unnecessary .
i m in let s go !
ok sir . would that be ok ?
there 's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
thanks for taking care of it .
i 'm completely lost . i 'm trying to find the way to my daughter 's home .
here 's your change . thank you .
no . if you ca n't break it keep the change . but can you give me a receipt ?
here is your receipt . thank you .
yes they all stop at this corner .
i want to go to broadway and 82nd street . can i take any bus that comes along ?
you can take any bus except the number 9 .

they run about every five minutes .
fine . how long does it take to get to 82nd street ?
about fifteen minutes . it 's not far . are you a stranger in new york ?
yes i am . i arrived only three days ago .
how do you like new york city ?
i like it very much but it 's a little confusing to me .

yes . go straight ahead till you come to the traffic lights turn left there and it 's the first turning on the right .

thanks a lot .

yes i was using a cell phone . i just bought it so i decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it . while i did that i also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs and um . . guess i had too many distractions .

no but i ca n't imagine that a girl like you would wonder to see a war movie .
don t worry . that s just a part of being a teenager .

that s great ! i m glad to hear that pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . is pear still interested in having those ?
no we re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . we were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
surely . let s get started by drafting a new contract .
sure what kind of shoe are you looking for ? we ve got <unk> sandals sleek high heels edgy pumps or if you re looking for something a little more practical we ve got mary janes ballerinas .
i like high heels .
ok right this way . what color did you have in mind ?
black . classic .
of course . we ve got this style here that is very popular . because it s an opentoe shoe you can wear it any time of the year . they look great on everyone .
umm . too shiny . and i wear pantyhose with my shoes so let s look for a <unk> shoe .
ok these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a twoinch heel so they are very comfortable .
i don t like the pointed toes . let me take a look at what else you have . too high . that one looks like the back would cut into my heel . i have a high instep so i doubt that one will fit properly . i don t want bows . i find <unk> very uncomfortable . those might as well be stilettos . too modern . ah finally this is what i m looking for .
i don t think anything can do .
size 41 .
do you own your own <unk> ?
hmmm . not good . they re too tight . the length is right but the shoe is too narrow and it s pinching my toes . and there d be no room for my <unk> . you know what ? i don t think i have the patience for this today . they just do you know what ? i ll come back another time .
have a nice day ma am .
why not ? come on ! just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
i will ! i ll feed it bathe it and walk it every day ! we can get a <unk> or a german <unk> !
what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus our apartment is too small for that <unk> of dog .
ok . how about we get a cat or a <unk> ?
we re planning on having children soon i don t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
fine ! let s get a bird then ! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! a parrot would be awesome !
i ll tell you what i can get you some hamsters and we ll take it from there .
<unk> !
well since we are getting up so late i decided to make a big breakfast !
nice ! brunch !
kind of so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
wow ! you really went all out ! did you make any coffee ?
yeah just the way you like it ! i also put out some cereal and <unk> if you feel like having something more light .
looks good ! i ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
get the jam and butter while you are in there ! oh ! and don t forget the syrup !
what ? you don t know the first thing about gardening !
on the contrary i have been reading a lot of books about the subject .
oh yeah ? tell me then smarty pants how will you go about setting up your garden ?
well first i need to buy some things such as fertilizer seeds and tools .
what type of tools ?
you know the basics . a rake shovel spade and a hoe .
right . well it seems like you have all your bases covered . what s next ?
i ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . i ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! gardening all done !
well good luck with your garden especially considering we are in the dry season and it won t rain for the next three months !
no thank you i am not interested .
please ma am if you could spare five minutes of your time i am sure we could find something that interests you !
i wish i could but i have to walk the dog and finish cooking so if you would excuse me .
we have a great variety of magazines all about cooking ! this one for example is a bi monthly publication with recipes from all over the world !
wow that would be kind of useful do you have any other cooking magazines ?
sure do ! this one is a quarterly publication but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas !
wow this is nice ! ok sign me up for both publications .

i think i might have a look at something important to eat .
you actually think it looks nice ?
it is in the suburbs .
generally speaking you can pick it up .
the complaint rate for our new product line is very high almost eight percent .
could you tell me more about the price ?
how beautiful !
no . . .
please call me .
we will try to have it again .
do you think so ?
i like it but there is one problem .

yes it is nice today .
that would be perfect .

that s great . i d like to make an appointment right now .
i 'm sorry but there are several minutes available now . how about tomorrow afternoon ?
it sounds perfect .
i 'll see you then .
but i think i can help to fix it .
yes . i like it very much .
so is it ?
just get over here !
how much problem ?
when i asked how people were going to dress dr . <unk> said it was casual .
i see . is there anything else wrong with it ?
how beautiful !
you should check the connections .
yes that 's great .
we apologize for the inconvenience .
where s your apartment ?
i m happy to hear you say that .
what are your plans now that you re getting out ?
the rent is 725 each month .
that s way too much .
that s true .
i do n't know . i 'd like to buy a few more souvenirs .
can i pay by card ?
that s what i charge .
what will you be paying ?
does that include utilities ?
what would you have for a la cane ?
first i need to share what the purpose of a home inspection is .
i had a home inspection before .
for a home inspection is a little expensive but it will not be expensive .
you re right . i ll call you back later .
your offering price is fairly high .
i didn t remember .
your owners might not be aware of everything wrong with the house .
can i pay by private check ?
i had a very good idea of the house .
yep . when is it available ?
are you kidding ?
make sure that you transfer the utilities to your name and tell them when you will be moving in .
i want to paint the walls a different color .
how much do you mean it ?
that 's good .
what style are you going to have ?
that would be great . i will go bring it here .
do n't worry .
yes . which one is the brake again ?
the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas .
i m glad this car is an automatic . i do n't like having to change gears .
automatics are very simple to drive . the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver s seat !
very funny . next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . can you see out of them ?
i can t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . could you move it forward a bit please ?
sorry i m not sure what you re doing .
it s a very good idea .
check your petrol situation .
the tank is almost empty . i guess i ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up .
that s a good idea . put your keys in the ignition start it up put the car in reserve wait for the road to be clear and then back out of the <unk> .
i got it . i ll get you there in one piece .
remember no honking this time . the horn is only for emergencies !
why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ?
i 'm not quitting yet . you know my favourite slogan do n't you ?
yeah i know . shop till you drop .
right !
and that 's it . you 're done .
what kind of food do you want ?
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
ahahah and i thought you were tired .

do n't worry mary i 've got you covered .
thanks jeanine you are a real pal . let 's go in .
eyes you sent them to new york right ?
that 's right . i thought i 'd come back to buy a few more souvenirs .
what do you think of the pamphlets with beautiful pictures ?
give me a short haircut .
we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . the same designs can be found on these posters .
posters are difficult to travel with . i think i 'll just buy the postcards . i heard that you might also have some of the <unk> that are made in venice .
yes we do . they 're on the wall behind you .
how much do they cost ?
not much at all . i think it 's about 100 dollars .
yes i think i 'd like the green mask in the middle .

how much money were you going on ?
i feel bad about it .
you . thank you very much .

is there anything else you need to do ?
are you willing to play table tennis ?
ok . teach me how to do it .
oh . i am not his fan .

i 'm going to stay here .
well i really like being with her .
ok we can wait a minute .
i 'm ready . let 's go .
i agree that it was bad service .
yes that ford .

it 's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances .
not to me i would n't be caught dead in that .
i love that kind of stuff .
yeah you seem to like those styles .

this one looks really expensive though .
i do n't care how much it costs . i 'm rolling in it .
lucky you ! i ca n't buy anything else . i 'm flat broke .
i got a replace my party outfit i trashed it last week .
why did you drag me into this ? i 've spent a week salary .
are you on the level ? you 're the one who called me remember ?
just joking t . i 've got some wonderful clothes . let 's go and have a close look at your outfit .
you can buy the bubble wrap here but you ll have to stand in line over here to post your package .
i hope it s a really long line .
it takes about 3 minutes per person so it ll probably be about an hour s wait .
can i buy stamps here ?
sure . how many would you like ?
i need 30 for my christmas cards .
are you sending them abroad ?
twenty of them are going abroad to china and america .
do you have any going anywhere in the eu ? if you do those are less expensive .
i am afraid not . i do n't have much cash with you .
what did you do last night ?
and the bubble wrap ?
that s another quid .
thanks a lot . you ve been very helpful .
i want to buy a sweater .
what kind of scent do you like ?
she usually does n't wear anything but a few drops of chanel no . 5 . but i 'd like to buy her a new fragrance .
ok here are some of our most popular perfumes .
which one would you recommend ?
del is the best choice .
that smells great . i 'll take one bottle please .
would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
it 's ok . she normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder and i do n't know what shade to buy .
how about some lipstick ? every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick .
she does n't usually wear lipstick . she thinks it makes her nose look too big .
how about some mascara ? that will make her eyes look bigger .
no thank you . she has big enough eyes as it is .
i know what she would likesome whitening cream .
no thanks . western women usually try to make their skin darker not lighter .
will that be all then ?
that will be all . you 've been very helpful thanks .
yeah i 'm glad that we did n't have to wait long . i 'm starving !
let 's take a look at the menu so we can order . do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?
what would you rather have samosas or poppadoms ?
i heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .
well let 's get a plate of those then .
sounds good . what are you going to have for your main course ?
i think i might have a dahl .
what 's in a dahl ?
it 's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .
that sounds nice .
ok . how about some lamb kebabs ?
that 's my favourite . do you want to have some wine or beer ?
i think i 'll have a beer .
ok shall i flag down the waitress ?
i would n't recommend it . i think we should wait until she comes round .
you 're right . that might seem a bit rude . it 's a good thing i 've got you with me !
what would you do without me ?
what kind of clothes do you want ?
i think we have the red one .
i think this would be a good idea .
that model is ok . anything else ?
that sounds like a deal .
i do n't think so .
straight ahead is n't that will be ?
i ca n't afford it . how can i do that ?
me too . do n't worry about it .
i like the brown one . i think that one fits me well . can i try it on ?
okay . i see .
the style is all right but i 'm not sure about the color . let me think for a while .
i hope so .
why do n't you have a cause ?
i like seafood on my pizza .
you can get a burger or some chinese food . or maybe you can get some mexican food .
yeah right ! i m serious ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
would you like me to buy one ?
i don t know what to say .
which kind would you like to have ?
yeah right ! i think it s really good !
yeah it is easy !
once you want to go to the supermarket where you might like to go .
i 'll try it .
yes can you recommend some steak ?
come on you .
here is the menu . hold on please !
sichuan food is usually hot . you have to try that .

i have no idea .
i have just finished .

i really appreciate you doing this for me .
you 're welcome

which one would you recommend ?
the cream form is very popular .
del is better than dialup ?
yes much better . watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . what was that ?
what exactly does that mean ?
i mean you .
that means that i ca n't use my phone and the internet at home .
you wo n't have to pay anything on your phone .
i have done some washing clothes here .
go and get it done .
i can learn it now .
yes . thank you .
ok . i 'll wear them .
yes but can you tell me how to get it ?
no . they are n't .
i have to go to the police station .
i 'll try .
i feel bad .
i 'm happy to hear that .
i 'm not ready yet .
the early bird gets the worm .
i really need to get my license right now .
i 'll see you tomorrow .

can you eat the seed ?
no some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
i can teach you .
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
oh i guess you 're right .
some of my grappa will cure your shyness .
i know . you 're right .
where do you want to buy a mangoes ?
where are they ?
most of them in this store are from mexico .
it is take about 20 minutes to get there .

we can get started as soon as you fill out this form .
i hope you can make the new cards just like my old cards .
you wo n't be able to tell the difference with a magnifying glass .
. . . okay i 'm through . here 's the form and my old card .
very good . you can pick up your order in one week .

i have never heard of that .

oh thank you for your advice .
right then .
of course . i 'm in a bit of a hurry .
what was the matter with you ?
i have no idea . let me take it .
so what am i going to do ?
english . i 've liked english ever since middle school .
what was the greatest strength ?
yes i was born in college .
how did you do this semester ?
i do n't know .
excuse me what is it ?
i think he 's ok .
i agree . probably it 's difficult to say .
they decided to look around .
do you know what you mean .
i did n't believe it .
it 's a bit stiff . what do you think ?
then i would like to fix it .
i agree with you .
i 'm just relaxing today . i 'm going to rain tomorrow .
i do n't think so .
ok . what about you ?
ha really ? it does n't matter .
thank you . professor donald .
it will be nicer soon .
do you think i will do a good job ?
i am going to england .
got it . good luck !
i 'm not sure . i ca n't agree with you .
really ? how long does it take ?
let 's have a look at it . is there anything else ?
i mean you .
you have never thought of you did a good job .
i could n't say that . what do you do to lose a job ?
i like them very much .
i 'm still jealous about it .
well . i think it makes a good idea .
yes it sounds good to me .
that s fine . what is it ?
sounds like you should study hard .
nice to meet you lvan . my name is alike . i 'm from japan .
nice to meet you too .
a second language is always difficult .
true but english is harder than most . it s a crazy language .
a crazy language ? why do you say that ?
one letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .
i think you say english is a crazy language .
not bad . i didn t feel bad about it .
what really ?
i have to take a driver 's course .
but how much was your family ?
to be honest i like most of them except for my chinese teacher . she is quite young but her class is too boring !
i think so too . i do n't like him either . well who do you like best ?
oh there was a foreign teacher .
she s a teacher .
she 's in the hospital with my dad .
i ca n't agree more . what about your family ?
i was thinking of her off .
i think it s not a simple thing to do .
i think so . i have to go .
and do you need anything else ?
basically a swim station is like a treadmill except instead of running you swim .
what are you talking about ? what are you doing ?
thanks .
i hear we ll have a new english teacher this semester .
no . she was a writer 's teacher .
are you kidding ?
who was the first child ?
yeah i think so .
she likes to golf dance and eat foreign food .
what a shame .
i learned a lot from panda express .
but it 's unfair .
i only need some help .
i will feel better soon .
no but she was in a hurry !
i see . so what you need to do then ?
i know her .
do you think she will recover soon ?
of course they are .
you mean armistice day ?
she 's sitting under the tree .
that sounds like fun .
yes my roommate likes it very much .
that s a good idea .
what about you ?
you ca n't help learning when you 're using it all day . you ll see . a few weeks study in the school will have a similar effect on you .
what makes you feel that i should do ?
oh she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use english throughout the class . she does n't mind your making mistakes though .
you know speaking in class is a very good chance to put your english to practical use .
that 's the new teacher .
what do you think of the teacher ?
she 's very nice .
what does she teach ?
english of course .
is she your teacher ?
yes . she teaches our class three times a week .
can she speak chinese to her students ?
not very much .
it 's a good thing you can speak english !
yes i finished last friday .
you sound relieved .
well yes . i do n't mind admitting that i am . i enjoyed school but i did object to having to go in every day once we 've done all our exams .
well what are you going to do now ? have you made any plans ?
yes i intend to go to university . that ll be in september . but it all depends on my a level results .
you mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your a level subjects ?
not really . i bring your hobby with me .
five days a week too ?
actually five and a half . on saturday we have classes only in the morning .
gosh !
that 's too much for us really .
i 'm so excited . finally we have done a good job .
to the beach
when do you start school ?
i 'm going to register right now .
what account do you need to wait ?
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
in the meantime he 's a bit conservative .
i have never thought about that .

in addition to a public school or a private school .
it 's better for some private schools .
well in most private school school students only go to a private school or public school .
what kind of job do they offer ?
we send our kids to private school but that s good .
it 's better for the environment too .
we don t have any children so i d like to use .
there are hundreds and hundreds . english is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions .
can you give us an example ?
i 'll look up the rate . to look up does n't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . it means to search for and find some information .
what about the expression goodbye ? is that an idiom ?
that is just a natural grammatical english expression . it has a direct translation in other languages .
this is interesting ms . parker .
i need to open a second account .
give them here .
yes i have it .
how much altogether ?
i know i did .
yes and not expensive either .
what if i can t meet that requirement ?
190 yuan .
i won t be able to pay that right now .
i m going to cancel your account right now .
i ll see you then .
i need to withdraw some money .
ok sir . here is your bill . that s 1000 all together .
what do you want me to do next ?
what do you want to know ?
when i were you born ?
ok it 's a date then !
then what do i do ?
would you like cash back ?
okay . here you go .
do you have a credit card with us ?
oh i have it . thanks .
well i 'm looking for a job .
you will need to apply for one .
oh . i think so .
well you can leave your name and phone number .
i d like to do that .
ok it 's a date then !
what do i have to get done ?
every option you can choose will appear on the screen . that s about it .
when will my passport be ready ?
not long . they 'll be ready in a few minutes .
i do n't have it .
do you need a spot here or off campus ?
i have both but i usually use my car to get to school .
where 's your car ?
i am not sure what a handicapped spot is .
the handicapped logo with blue means that you are not to park there unless you have a handicapped permit . will you mostly be parking during the day or the night ?
i park in the daytime .
be careful about the time limits on the streets . have you seen the signs for time limits ?
no i have not seen the signs .
pay attention to what the signs tell you in terms of time limits and what days you can park there . do you know what the curb colors mean ?
what curb colors ?
just remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means loading and unloading only . i think you 'll be good to go !
then you can call it by the card .
then i 'll get back in a few minutes .
i needed you to be done and finished an hour ago .
certainly it is easy . i need to get my license .
good . now just complete this form .
actually i ca n't help it .
of course . i can help you .
okay thanks . i 'll take care of it .
which one interests you sir ?
that will be fine then .
no it may be worse than it seems . how 's it feel ?
how about going to be ?
yes how can i help you ?
so what game do you want to go ?
thanks professor .
what was your speed then ?
sure . how do you like it ?
i would also like a bag of chips .
is everything ok ?
sorry i have no problem with that .
so you can use it .
no i did n't .
are you going anywhere ?
i guess i could give you the wrong information .
you can take me there ?
how about you ?
remember that you are in college now not high school .
which account do you take in ?
how long will that take ?
have you ever been to class before ?
but i ca n't believe it .
these days .
what about the class ?
he 's in his class .

no i think i can afford it .

i spend a lot of time studying .

may i look at my bill ?
i 'll teach you if i can .
buckle up .
where can we be ?
what do you need to do ?
well what kind of classes would you like to get ?
yes it 's useful for me to find a job .
we hope you will recover soon .
yes i 'm looking for a sweater .
i m sorry . it s for reference only so it must stay in the library . but you re welcome to look through it .
yes i have it . here you go .

i feel dizzy .
let me think about it .
the lecturer is dull too .
i feel he 's like a talking machine .

i see what you mean .
leave me alone .
love me !
but he 's not good at .
dad ! i do n't know what 's wrong with her .

he s not easy to learn .
that 's funny .
yes i used to be happier .
what is good for you ?
what a pity .
yes . if you think so ?
i ca n't help him with that .
because i m crazy about you . . .
it 's better for me .
he ll be too angry .
he was having any trouble with it .
that 's great .
when you take something out of the stores you need to update the stores database so we know when to <unk> .

no i did n't . besides it was excellent .
it 's really good .
i do n't think much of the film .
i think it is the worst one i have ever seen .
oh i 'm not sure i agree with you . it was not a good one but it was not the worst one . actually it was n't too bad .
i ca n't think the same .
what 's more some scenes were good much fit for the children .
i could n't agree with you .
yes sir . how may i be of service ?
you did n't know ?
never mind .
i 'm a little worried about my host family . you know in the agreement i have to do some cooking for them .

yes . he s already got the passport and visa .
fantastic ! please send him my congratulations .
thank you . he s very lucky indeed .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
not at all .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
because i love history .
no you know the roses .
what do you mean ?
is that true ?
it 's true .
it 's a big deal .
i 'm sick of it too .
i 'm going to the store would you like any pesto pistol ?
it 's no use complaining . if we had got enough money we could n't put up with it and would have moved out .
let 's happen then . i am just looking forward to everything with you .
how could i feel easy ? i m really pissed .
but you should avoid <unk> when you haven t got the real facts .
ok . i ll try my best to calm down first .
oh i am very sorry hans . thank you for waiting for me . you must have been here a long time already .
it s all right .
i was caught in the heavy rain or i would have come earlier . i am sorry i kept you waiting .
i was in a comfortable place so really it s no problem . i am happy to see you . did the rain hold you up long ?
yes . when i came out of the subway it was raining cats and dogs . and i forgot my umbrella . so i had to wait for the rain to let up .
i totally understand .
she didn t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day s hard work .
poor girl !
not much except that my motherinlaw is driving me up the wall .
oh that 's terrible . i do n't think about it .
i have a dentist appointment .
my motherinlaw used to do the same thing to us . if it was n't disciplining them enough then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them the schools we sent them too and everything else under the sun .
for example some countries restrict imports by <unk> restriction .
no i ca n't see that happening . i know you 're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
it 's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .
my motherinlaw used to do the same thing to us . if it was n't disciplining them enough then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them the schools we sent them too and everything else under the sun .
that 's true .
no but i didn t know .
i 'm sorry to hear that . she 's gone .
hi . steven .
but that s not the first time .
thank you for saying so .
that s fine with me . i could go with you .
that s ok .
i ve thought it over .
no way ! how s on tomorrow ?
no i can t tell you .
ok i ll talk to you about that .
what s wrong with it ?
first of all you want to learn english well ?
a vegan . i do n't eat or use any animal based products . i do n't know what to do .
that case is good too !
maybe . but can i expect him to help me ?
wow ! i 'd love to !
thank you for the chinese think .
i m sure you do miss that type of cooking . but can t you try to get used to western food ?
i have tried . but americans like butter bread sugar and cream too much .
i suppose you re right lee . maybe that s why so many westerners are overweight .
it s interesting that americans work very hard at their jobs do not take naps during the day and yet they can be so heavy .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too much fast food and that food is very fattening .
why don t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy being outside working during the day ?
what do you suggest ? i can t afford to quit my job until i get a new one .
maybe you have two choices . you could attend school during the day or you could get a position that provides training .
really it 's so beautiful .
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
you must n't pick it in this place .
where it is ?
it 's a private garden .
terrible !
i would like to buy some help .
of course . i will get right on it .
yes . you ve made a mistake .
what does he say ?
i bought it last week .
will that be the sixth of september ?
yes . i would attach your baggage receipt to your ticket .
thank you . ah ! but this is in french . would you mind giving me the english menu ?
there is . i love animals here .
you mean that you need to read the books ?
i know .
i 'd love to . but i 'm not really sure what i should do .
just alive ? what do you mean ?
but you must feel disappointed .
yeah i suppose i should .
what happened to me ?
in whom would you like to talk to ?
no i 'm not interested in your apartment .
are you really ? how did you do that ?
i do n't know . well my contract here is for one year and i do n't know what i should do after that . maybe going around for a while .
well have you ever thought about learning some chinese ?
actually i am learning that now . but it 's too hard for me . you know the four tones and the stuff . it really <unk> me out .
do n't worry . all things are difficult before they are easy .
you hit the nail right on the head .
well are you invested in some <unk> program ?
no . this is my first time to buy some .
it only has 4 beds and 4 writing desks but it is spacious and bright .
awesome . i 've been giving this a lot of thought . when can we do this ?
how about this sunday ?
ok cool .
good . i 'll give you a call tonight .
thanks . goodbye .
i would also like a bag of chips .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
i am not in the mood .
why are you feeling depress ?
i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . it 's a real letdown .
i do n't think she would do such a thing .
but she did and it made me disappointed .
oh cheer up ! a girlfriend is not everything .
but she means a lot to me .
then forgive her mistake .
oh . i just can t forget it .
do n't you have to know anything about stocks ?
yeah they do .
i have no idea .
i agree .
well our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive . i have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages .
yes i like . but i ca n't play it well .
what do you think of it ?
oh sorry mom . thank you mom .
but where ?
do you have an appointment with him ?
where would you like to go ?
good . you really know how to play the game .
i 'll meet you later .
i like that but i still love her .
which one do you mean ?
so what kind of music do you like ?
but i do n't know how to handle it .
i wish it was n't too bad .
i 'm very interested in the hero .
we still have a lot of choices .
yes it helps me to keep fit .
what 's your parents opinion ?
tell me what you were interested in .
i guess i will .
no that 's it . and i 'd like to see it .
let 's do it .
thank you . i 'd like a glass of orange juice please .
sure no problem . may i see your id please ?
ok then what would you like to have ?
which dish do you like ?
i am sorry too . i know we 've been talking about this beach trip for a while . i should have told bob i was busy this weekend .
do n't be silly . you guys should spend as much time together as you can . besides we can go to the beach anytime .
thanks for understanding .
well that 's what being friends is about is n't it ?
hey what if the three of us go to the beach together ? besides you and bob have n't seen each other for a while . i do n't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers .
nah i would n't worry about that . but i do n't want to be the third wheel . you two should have some quiet time to yourselves .
i know bob wo n't mind . you can bring a date like that guy from the bar you keep talking about .
maybe . . . i 'll think about it .
well last night i had a big argument with ann .
terrible . it must be something serious . you two are such close friends .
now that i look back at it it was n't that big a deal . i should n't have lost my temper .
i 'm sorry . maybe they can do something wrong with it .
i told you to get this consignment out last week . we ca n't very well run a light bulb conference without any light bulbs can we ? what am i going to do with you ?
that 's pretty harsh .
i know but i was so upset . i mean come on ! does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ?
you know she probably feels just as bad .
well i think i was being a little selfish myself . i know they do n't get to see each other very often .
well in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding . you should n't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . after all you can go to the beach anytime you want .
yeah i 'll call later to patch things up .
that 's very kind of you to say so . let 's try some <unk> wines .
great . sweet wines are my favorite . they always make a great finish to a decisions meal .
do you prefer brandy or ports .
port please .
excellent choice . i love its smooth flavor .
the port is quite exquisite . it must have spent years aging in barrels . am i right ?
yes . you always have a good nose for wines .
next time we are about to dinner we should try some canadian ice wine .
oh what 's that ?
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
why not ? it sounds great .
ok here 's to your health .
thanks . cheers .
cheers .
of course i do n't .
how about yours ?
i 'm sorry . i forgot .
yes sir . we have your reservation . could you fill up these forms please ?
no it won t be a problem . i d like to but i m not sure myself .
what 's wrong with him ?
i have no idea .
alright . but i 'll come back later .
yes flexible aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department .
that 's too bad .
he 's cute .
how did this happen ?
i bet he was disqualified .
what happened in your birthday ?
yeah . what is he like ?
what s wrong ? that was a great goal .
yes but i bet 200 dollars on the cougars !
looks like you re going to lose out on this game then .
i can t believe it ! i thought the cougars were going to win for sure .
what were the odds ?
20 to 1 in favour of the cougars !
too bad .
what is it ? what happened ?
i think someone is stalking me .
no it ca n't be . really ? who ?
i do n't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking but staring . he just kept staring at me . he did n't stop .
if you do n't know what else he might do .
when i entered the room i forgot to close the door .
did he leave when you left ?
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .
i do n't think you can do anything .
that 's about five blocks . and around corners too . so he was definitely following you .
yes he was . i 'm not imagining it . finally just when i got home i turned around and looked at him . he was just standing there . he did n't smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious . what should i do ? i 'm so scared . can i call the police ?
actually i do n't think you can call the police . not yet at least . he has n't done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it . but if anything happens again then maybe you should call .
why ca n't i call the police now ? he was definitely following me !
of course you can call the police if you want . that 's not what i mean . i 'm just saying that they probably wo n't do anything .
i suppose . what can they do ? i do n't even know who he is .
listen carol . do n't let this bother you too much . probably it 's nothing . just keep your eyes open when you go out . if you see him a third time and if he follows you again then i think we should go to the police . but for now just try not to worry .
alright . and i wo n't go to that cafe for awhile .
more or less . there 's just one thing bothering me .
oh ? what 's that ?
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
what gift ?
it 's an egyptian carpet . the student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . seeing what gift was i was really uncomfortable . i mean it 's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor
you refused the gift ? that 's terrible .
i know but i really ca n't accept such an expensive gift . i explained to him why but he seemed really upset about it . i think he might have taken it the wrong way .
perhaps . he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
that 's what i am worried about . i do understand the respect attached with the gift and i am honored . but i really do n't think it 's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . i think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
can you tell me how to get to the jade buddha temple ?
i ca n't skate well . i 'm afraid it 's still too hot .
i agree with you .
have you received it yet ?
sorry to hear that .
that 's hard to say . if it is n't too cold for a while .
oh come on . why do n't you grill them ?
they said that i would spend a lot of time waiting . see you then .
what kind of apartment is it ?
bring me your id please .
i do n't know what you mean .
i told you to get this consignment out last week . we ca n't very well run a light bulb conference without any light bulbs can we ? what am i going to do with you ?
are the post office ?
yes i 'm very sorry to hear that .
are you a problem ?
you mean the one with mexican restaurant ?
let 's sing it together .
it 's so oldfashioned .
maybe you can start by then .
i guess they 're in luck .
a vegan . i do n't eat or use any animal based products . i do n't know what to do .
hmm you mean it is fun .
oh by the way it was terrific .
it 'll be fun !
you know sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . they may insist they are sick when they are not .
thank you for telling me . it doesn t look like a gift .
you 're in luck !
mom you 're right . how much is the fare ?
my birthday comes next month . i want to hold a birthday party too .
is there anything else available ?
then i came back here . i worked for about three years to get some experience .
that 's fantastic ! i just got back from bali .
yes i remember what you should do .
am i ready for what ?
i guess it will be . i 'll miss you for the invitation .
what is it that you need to do ?
i love you too .
what time are you leaving ?
i 've got it all taken care of .
oh really ? that 's too bad .
how much do that ?
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
how do you think of it ?
i think it 's better for you .
maybe they 'll be back in ten minutes .
hello steven . how 've you been ?
i do n't think i have .
no i thought .
oh kate . . .
how about you ? when are you leaving for berkeley ?
yes and not expensive either .
great ! and when you hear it change that means you have an outside line .
well i would say that i m just drifting here in the pool .
that s wonderful . i thought you had been in town .
well our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive . i have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages .
have you thought about graduate school ?
i recently graduated from college as an english major .
what did you do last night ?
you got me .
now listen ben . look i think it s a very good thing that a young man after he s done some very good work should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself and lie around and drink beer and so on .
i think that 's what i can do .
i like chinese food . i do n't know something about chinese food .
what are you going to cook ?
what 's the matter ?
pretty good sam . only the awful weather you know .
that s right . i ve never really liked it since i got here .
me either but i m dealing with it anyway .
well i ve got some papers due .
really ? so what s the news ?
not too good yet . better than i was though .
what 's the matter ?
he 's from the fridge .
maybe we did n't get started .
sure !
i do n't know .
it 's thursday i think .
you did n't know what ?
you did .
what did he do ?
i 'm planing to go <unk> tonight . tomorrow i was hoping to see a movie . what about you ?
i like the novels of dickens very much .
so are <unk> and many others .
no it is just hard to tell them .
can you tell me something about it ?
how did you get it ?
i agree . i really do n't like it .
sure . it 's one of the biggest classical music events . have you ever been to the live show ?
yes i did .
how was it ?
that 's for sure . you know i had the greatest time ever .
what are the odds ?
oh speaking of the conductor he is indeed a genius . he did a perfect job . his name is menuhin a descendent of russian american immigrants .
trust me .
oh i hope so . bye .
but let 's do it .
depends .
that 's why i did n't listen to it .
he lost his kids college money day trading .
what terrible !
as long as you can try to go there .
which country is that ?
yes . the scenery there is so breathtaking
ok . let 's go to the station .
i feel that i have a thorough checkup .
i really ca n't agree there .
i like it .
it sounds like it 's environment .
do n't worry you 'll find the way .
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
let me see . what 's the problem ?
after a while crocodile .
ok what 's your name please ?
i have apple pie ice cream chocolate cake and fruit cocktail .
how about the tires ?
what kind of deal is it ?
yes . see you then .
alright wait a minute .
it works for you .
can i help you with anything else ?
the closest garage . what 's the charge ?
okay . i 'll take you .
it 's convenient and cheap .
it 's still a popular hobby .
that 's very kind of you . how much is it ?
i bet you can buy a parttime job now .
i agree with you .
i think you should try the best . what do you want ?
thank you so much . is there anything else wrong with that ?
you 've got to choose . do you have your id card ?
i know i could learn that .
that s kind of boring . i like playing basketball .
me too .
i used to play basketball every day . it 's a great pity .
do n't worry .
no i do n't . i prefer to watch it .
what was it ?
maybe you are right . i should ask them more .
it is such a nice place .
sure what would you like to discuss ?
wait bye !
i know . i ca n't agree more .
are you sure ? how have you been with her ?
yes it is . let 's go .
no you ca n't .
i learned to be patient and i have a look .
where did he go ?
yes . the first three years ago .
so why do you choose it ?
do you remember it clearly ?
it 's so special about chinese culture .
that 's interesting .
when do you find out ?
that 's great .
he 's going to the office now . maybe he does n't know anything .
trust him .
maybe you can speak english and japanese .
can you think of a job that is what you want ?
never mind . i appreciate it very much .
really ? it 's huge .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
i 'm a little worried about my host family . you know in the agreement i have to do some cooking for them .
what 's the program ?
it bears a great many of advantages but also some weak points .
is it ? i 've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
for instance the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .
that 's true . some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
actually it 's not the fault of the mobile phone . but people should have a proper attitude towards it . mobile phone is a tool serving people not the fetters restricting them .
really ? how come ?
i know . i do n't feel bad .
you 're kidding . why do n't you ask them to go out ?
yes i guess . are you kidding ?
oh no ! i 'll get it .
what else can i do ?
that should be no problem .
yeah . water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues .
but what are the sources of water pollution ?
they could generally be divided into two categories direct and indirect contaminant sources .
you 're kidding .
yeah . they are emitted directly into urban water supplies .
but what about the indirect ones ?
indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater .
i see . for the sake of us all we should be an active participator in the prevention of it .
sure . it 's an issue asking for everyone 's participation .
okay let 's call it a day .
well i do n't know .
she might do well .
you mean what 's happening ? well constable i 'm trying to get out of the windowand fred here is helping me .
how did you feel about that ?
i told you to get this consignment out last week . we ca n't very well run a light bulb conference without any light bulbs can we ? what am i going to do with you ?
which is better ?
this job provides full medical dental and disability .
it sounds like a great idea .
i think most of it .
i do n't know .
this is for sure . i am on the street .
when you take something out of the stores you need to update the stores database so we know when to <unk> .
i know several of them .
then what 's the problem ?
yes sir . why do n't you call me to the gym ?
how about 6 o 'clock ?
sounds not good . i wo n't take it .
in front of the train station .
when did you say ?
how about you ?
ok . bye !
i think so . i bought a new apartment .
i 'm sorry to hear that . what 's the problem ?
well i 'd better go to another car .
i agree with you .
i 'm sorry . i did n't know that .
well i 'm not into the mood .
good afternoon ! sit down please . how are you ?
could you do me a favor ?
you know in china we usually do n't open presents until the guests leave .
you are welcome bob .
yes . i have decided to take a look at it .
where did you work at ?
thank you very much . what 's the number ?
a korean film called friends starring sang donggun .
did you go to the top of it ?
how did you like the movie ?
i thought it was pretty good .
really ? i ca n't say i agree .
is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ?
it 's romantic .
i guess it could happen .
is this a promise ?
is n't there anything else ?
well do n't worry about it .
thank you for telling me about it .
yeah it 's impossible to forget .
and what movie will you do ?
no . come on .
yes sunday sounds fine . what time ?
what ?
i ca n't wait until tomorrow night .
friday is ok with me . i would like to come back tomorrow .
how about seven o 'clock ?
hi angela it 's dan .
no that 's 4479626 .
what would you like for a drink ?
hold on please . let me check out the tickets this evening .
in that case will be fine .
no i m sorry . i 'm going to meet some friends tomorrow evening . and i 'm in a hurry now .
yeah . thank you very much .
really ? how many people are you planning to pay ?
my name is luo gang and the phone number is 5133284 .
it is wait a moment .
how about the lyrics ?
what is your greatest weakness ?
and the other words ?
it surely is .
how much is the winter ?
i 'm not sure what you mean .
i 'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the conference . i do n't think we should continue with the tv advertising .
seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? that 's a good idea . let 's go !
i do n't think we can afford too . what kind of food would you like ?
i am so sorry for bothering you .
i 've got it . i like the sound of stepping on the snow very much .
yes . very wonderful .
do you smell the sweet scent ?
how big is it ?
no it sure did n't happen again .
okay . i 'll do it .
are they sure ?
of course ! i have n't taken it yet .
then how much happened ?
he had a mask on me .
when did it happen ?
i went to the movies .
that 's a good idea . the theater was always a little crowded .
i d like to go swimming .
can it be a gift ?
let 's go .
neither . the game ended in two all .
but i still think ac milan's defence seems better organized .
but the brazilian is tougher .
do n't worry . he s really young too .
he 's over sixty .
have you ever heard of teenagers ?
i think i will like them too .
how about the subway ?
ok . i think it 's worth that .
oh yes . what kind of music do you like ?
what can you do ?
so i ca n't bear it !
well i personally do n't think . what i 'm going to do .
is that true ?
sports .
oh certainly . what kind of stamps do you like ?
you know what kind of music is best for .
i like doing aerobics in my spare time . it 's good for my health .
what is your favorite sport of all ?
yes i like it .
let 's go out tomorrow .
that would be lovely . when shall we go ?
not much . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .
oh that 's exciting . what 's this guy like ? is he hot ?
well i did n't think so at first . but as we started talking i found his extremely funny and witty . i could n't stop laughing at his jokes ! we have so much in common . we like the same teams music a
that 's really a good idea . you will see the advantage of it .
there 's nothing definite i think . i do n't have a list or anything but when i first meet somebody i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have radar h
well that 's something i 've never heard of . but if you ask me what i value most in a friend i would have to say honesty .
that 's exactly what the problem is .
yeah i know . a friend in need is a friend indeed . i do n't need fairweather friends either .
i like doing aerobics in my spare time . it 's good for my health .
that must be a popular hobby .
i like popular music best .
how about samba ?
yes . playing chess is a very aggressive experience . all the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . whenever i start a chess game i ca n't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all <unk> stand ready to kill .
i ca n't agree with you .
yes it 's right . i 'm going to help you relax .
fantastic . i like all kinds of things .
oh that 's nice of you .
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is really cute .
oh it 's love at first sight .
he did n't say but he said he would call me .
maybe he is busy with his work . just wait and try not to think about it too much !
oh steve . stop it ! i am a bit nervous ! what if he does n't call ?
come on mary you 're a total catch . i bet he will call you . do n't worry .
thank you steve . you 're always so encouraging .
that 's what friends are for .
thank you li mei . come into the dining room . i 'm going to cut the cake soon .
what do you want ?
she 's betty .
we are lucky to see you .
let me tell you the story . in 1892 patty smith hill and mildred hill wrote a song called good morning to you . but later someone added the words happy birthday to their tune .
you 're right . are you sure ?
i couldn t believe it .
i do n't like it .
i think i 'm in the mood for a visa .
what is wrong with you ?
i learned in college .
great ! how much do you like it ?
i suppose i would try it on .
i 'm in the mood for a few minutes .
yeah it s pretty nice but its so red because of air pollution .
wait a minute . it 's an accident .
wait . see you later .
maybe you can come around for a very long time .
really ?
great ! let 's go !
i 'd rather have stayed in it for a while .
yes i 'm free . but i ca n't wait to see them .
the kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . hide away yijun !
it 's gorgeous .
i think i 'm really cool .
oh no ! we 'd rather go out to the game .
i heard that .
ok go ahead .
ok boy .
yes sir . where do you want to go ?
i 've been talking to webtracker .
i 'll have to get that down to you .
let me guess .
that 's exactly what i was thinking .
but you did n't have to slow down .
tell me how you feel .
perhaps i 'd like that .
i 'm going to get back to you .
okay let 's go out .
i got it .
well i 'm meeting some american friends next weekend .
did i go to the station ?
he lost his kids college money day trading .
what happened ?
no they got engaged .
what i think that it 's going to rain .
it s terrible .
i 've got a cat .
it 's sad .
i ca n't believe this .
why do n't you give me a hand ?
there is a traffic accident .
i 'm sorry . what a pity .
what happened ?
are n't they cool ? i like the settings .
he did n't know that .
he took the money and tried to get away .
then he is really lucky .
it gives me a lot of pressure and i feel depressed .
to be honest i really ca n't agree with you .
really ? i ca n't believe it .
it seems to be perfect .
fine just a little tired .
and you look so nice .
no i love life .
he must be able to find a parttime job .
it 's lucky to be true .
that 's good . where did you stay ?
well we 're having a birthday party .
sounds like fun .
no . okay i want to be in touch with you .
what 's wrong with it ?
i do n't know what to say .
oh really ? so far ! how was it ?
well . john had promised to be my date but he stood me up . i waited for a full hour in the cold wind .
what 's your problem ?
are n't they cool ? i like the settings .
ok it 's unbelievable . i ca n't believe it .
when i entered the room i forgot to close the door .
very nice of you .
i 'm a nurse .
where did you walk ?
what time do you think of it ?
what 's your flight number ?
how dreadful !
if that 's enough i guess .
no . i 'm excited .
needless to say .
that sounds like fun .
i totally agree with you .
it 's half past seven .
what 's wrong with it ?
no i have it already .
we have a meeting with you .
no . i 'll be back later .
i 'll never turn it on .
i think so . i 'll come back for lunch .
and when will you stay ?
no . you need to learn something new .
of course . i ca n't bear it .
looking forward to meeting with you !
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
i see . they were terrible .
which one interests you sir ?
where did he come from ?
so how about another coffee ?
well why do n't you go to help me ?
jeez . tourists .
you 're right .
no ah . . . single sellers .
yeah it 's really a good idea . but let 's go .
you re in america now my british friend . we just call it football .
oh right . so i can t quite follow what s going on . . . who s winning ?
the giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked but the <unk> have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone .
wow ! what a hit !
yeah he tackled him so hard his helmet came off .
is he ok ?
it looks like it he s getting up .
i guess he hit him too hard the <unk> just called a penalty on the home team .
the giants ?
yes i do . he looks like a good job .
what are you going to do about it ?
what happened ? why did everyone get so quiet ?
the <unk> s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . we re losing again .
yeah i just got them . i started playing ice hockey in a community league . so i finally got myself new skates .
what position do you play ?
i m a defender . it s a lot of fun . you don t have to be able to skate as fast on defense .
yeah you re a pretty big guy . i play goalie myself .
oh yeah ? which team ?
the rockets .
really ? i think we play you guys next week . well i have to go to practice . see you later .
all right see you later .
we are going to climb a cliff on the colorado river .
how hard is the climb ?
it is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .
what did you do last week ?
we rappelled down the side of 300 foot cliff . it was very exciting .
wow ! that sounds like a lot of fun . i m sorry i missed it .
well you should come this weekend . i think you could do the climb .
yeah i will . see you then !
o . k . see you .
i 'm just watching some television .
i 'm so bored . i do n't know what i 'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning .
me too . do you think we are boring people ?
i do n't think we are boring . it 's just that we do n't have any hobbies .
that 's right . what do you think we should do as a hobby ?
that all depends on what you like to do . for example i like to doodle on the notepad so i 'm thinking about doing some real drawings .
i like to play the piano for fun .
yeah . that can be a good hobby .
hobbies are great . i 'm going to make a list of all the things i like to do .
that 's a great idea . i 'm going to do the same .
awesome we went to australia and new zealand .
that must have been wonderful . do anything interesting ?
well . we went bungee jumping when we were in malaysia .
wow ! isn t that dangerous ?
a little but the rush was worth it .
come on .
oh he 's 14 and in the past few months he 's become quieter and a bit secretive . he locks himself in his room and i think he 's running around with the wrong crowd .
500 feet ! i would never be able to do that .
yeah it was scary but exhilarating .
really ? how are you going to do that ?
yes . he loves the girl very much .
no i ca n't .
then is it ok ?
sometimes .
congratulations . that 's great .
i think so .
i see .
that 's why it is n't .
how could you tell me the truth ?
sounds like a good idea .
thank you . i will have that .
what kind of things do you want to listen to ?
yes . the hotel has just started .
it is a good idea .
they go to the cemetery to pay their respects to the dead .
that 's good idea .
when they re ready i must go .
i 've never been to either so i was thinking of going to disneyworld for my honeymoon .
ok thanks .
will mary and her husband be ready to leave for their honeymoon ?
they do n't always be so happy .
maybe you have fun of that .
well i ca n't say .
let s go .
wow . sounds fantastic !
i think it sounds a shame . just keep going all the time .
great . i 'll try .
no problem .
how amazing !
no problem . in fact the contract must be delayed .
that 's fantastic .
we try my best .
well let 's have a look .
i think so . i ca n't believe it .
you 're right .
yeah i could also look at the schedule .
no . there are only some seats left .
in that case please have a look .
i hope you will be there .
do you have any change ?
really ? where did you go ?
i believe it will happen .
i sure can .
what is that ?
of course not . he has big problems among others .
all right . here 's the money .
well i want to change .
anything else ?
thank you . can i have your ticket ?
hmm . we really need to go .
that s the point .
what about shoes ?
do n't you know that ?
so the answer ?
that 's true . i gotta see you later .
i 'd like to pay for the monthly sticker .
you ca n't i ?
maybe not . just bring me a bottle of wine .

are you kidding me ?
you are welcome . please don t mention it .
ok bye !
in this case i am not sure if i can do this .
i 'd love to meet you here .
i see you later .
excuse me miss .
keep in touch . bye !
sure . have you got anywhere in mind ?
i 'm starving so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .
that italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . do you want to go there ?
i 'm not really in the mood for italian actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy .
if you want spicy food then i 'd recommend going to a thai indian or chinese restaurant . how about that chinese buffet on <unk> road ?
i really like that restaurant you get a lot for your money there . but they 've westernized their food so it 's not actually that spicy .
you 're right . most of their dishes have sweet sauces . we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us .
the taj ? they 're a bit expensive but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
the taj it is then .
shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
they 'll still charge us a corkage fee .
that 's right . it 'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .
do n't worry about money . i 'll treat you tonight .
are you sure ? we could go dutch .
no i 'll pay . it 's my turn anyway . you paid last time .
i wo n't argue with that ! let 's go !
have you got any idea of it ?
thanks . see you then .
have you ever seen the house ?
okay mum .
i m waiting for you .
thanks ! these are beautiful . you should n't have !

it was great . the director took a lot of care while <unk> . they say be has good chance at winning the oscar for best director . also i like the actors some really great new young actors .
it was fantastic .
do you have a history of stomach pain ?
my boss gave me a big project . i had to have it finished by this morning . it was so difficult .
she s hot . well how about him ?
he 's over sixty .
i thought it was .
no it is . it 's an express .
that 's great . congratulations .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
he prefers suits to jackets .
judge from his look he 's a very serious person .
as a matter of fact he is .
do n't believe him . he 's a liar .
we cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
yeah . he is going to be a good father .
they have moved to chicago .
why do you say so ?
well our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive . i have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages .
i don t know . what about 50 ?
go ahead . how much will it be ?
it 's only about 300 dollars .
what about the deposit ?
i see what you mean .
i understand your position .
i 'll try a double room with a bath .
i 'd like to go to the movies .
what time do you have in mind ?
i 'd like to go somewhere else .
it 's fine with me but can i tell my friend about it ?
oh i didn t get enough sleep .
well the gaining day is month .
how about going in the city ?
thank you for reminding me .
yes thanks for coming .

good afternoon ! sit down please . how are you ?
i 'm very well thank you . how are you ?
very well too thank you very much . isn t it a lovely day ?
yes it 's beautiful but it 's also very hot .
i really do n't think this weather will last .
what would you like for a drink ?
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
is there any difference ?
i live in haitian district where there are lot of universities .
here . near this school .
i 'm fine thanks .
just fine . how have you been ?
just press this button .
good to see you too !
i like spring best .
how about summer ?
well our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive . i have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages .
i like spring too . we can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air .
i told you to get this consignment out last week . we ca n't very well run a light bulb conference without any light bulbs can we ? what am i going to do with you ?
do you want me to go talk to her ?
wait a minute .
do n't worry . the bus tour is really worth while . you can enjoy the whole city in a single day .
uh . . . yeah right .
we 'd better go out for a walk .
i 'll wait for you .
i like spring best .
how about summer ?
i dislike it most .
i do n't think that they have their act together .
well our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive . i have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages .
but sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
what will you do if i let you do ?
i really hate this weather .
you see that makes it .
it 's . . . oh it 's the 1st april april fool 's day .
you forgot all of about it did n't you ?
on 20th may 1963 .
do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ?
27th day of the fourth month .
by the way could you tell me when the film will begin ?
it will begin at five thirty .
by airmail ?
it will be 5 o 'clock .
i do n't want to miss it today .
oh by the way it was terrific .
what did you say ?
you know sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . they may insist they are sick when they are not .
i know what the view is . it really makes me understand .
i felt like it .
mary you 're right . how much is the fare ?
then i came back here . i worked for about three years to get some experience .
that 's great . what about you ?
yes i remember what you should do .
me too . recently i 've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them .
do n't you think it 's a sheer waste of both time and money ?
i 'm afraid not . to me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
it s all right . thanks very much .
i hope someone will be there someday .
they are . actually i 'm not good at the moment either .
when did you start worrying about your weight ?
crazy !
how about your summer ?
what else can i talk to ?
how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look ? i remember there is one in the gym .
that 's a good idea . i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
me too . what did you have in mind ?
i have n't decided yet but i think the olympic mascots are a must .
i agree . they 're very lovely especially huan huan huan .
that 's true .
the five dolls are sold together as a set and they 're priced according to the size . the bigger they are the more expensive .
oh i see . if i buy more than a set can i get any discount ?
i do n't think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now .
any other ideas ?
there are lots of things such as postcards key chains posters and various arts and crafts .
it all sounds great . we can go there after the match . i ca n't wait to see what they have .
i haven t decided yet .
great !
do you like it ?
if you like it while do you live in beijing ?
every option you can bring into a deposit certification to handle the pyramids .
that 's not too bad . but i should take it .
you can check out the number of every day .
not really . i did n't think much of them .
you mean you careful ?
thank you . where should i send your final phone bill ?
i love it . i think i 'll take it .
how can you solve them ?
no . i haven t been here long .
wow . tell me what you have done .

i m sorry . i don t like that .
thank you for your call .
i m sorry to hear that . what s the matter ?
what was good about it ?

this is unfair .
yeah we were so critical .
congratulations . how do you feel from your family ?
of course i missed you too .
i ve got a fever .
do you think you have any symptoms ?
i really do n't think i should .
do you eat any weight ?
yeah thanks for inviting me .
joe ? i do n't know what you mean .
i remember you are in love .
oh i took a shine to him when we met for the first time . but it comes and goes .
it 's greek to me .
so the reform can not be carried out well .
the government is making efforts to change situation .
i can t believe that .
he is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
what ? it s only 9 p . m . now . why today he went to bed so early ?
he ran four miles and came back dead beat .
he happened .
i 'm tired of your cutanddried opinions . who do you think you are !
how dare you speak to me like this .
hang on a second .
ok i 'll go after i get around for you .
don t worry . just check in your bag before entering .
you are so thoughtful .
why ? take it easy .
it must be dreadful to grow old .
it sure is . he has no one to turn to very miserable indeed .
have n't you heard that he is in prison ?
what ? beg your pardon .
john is in prison now . he was copped outstealing .
i just can n't believe my ears !
i ca n't deny that . she is so beautiful that i fell in love with her at the first sight . i wish i knew more about her .
but i heard that she had a threeyearold girl .
i can not belive that . it must be cooked up by someone .
of course i wo n't chill out . opportunity knocks only once .
you should strike while the iron is hot .
you 're right . i will have a talk to her about that .
really ? i thought he loved his wife very much .
yeah . but his relation with sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife .
he deserved it .
sorry i can t .

i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
that 's sounds great .
well i have a guest pass . why don t you come with me tonight ?

i 'd love to very much .

i know . i always hope for the best and prepare for the worst .
then you will be in line for a doom .
could you do me a favor ?
everything is fine . do you need any help ?
no . i have actually .
what did it say ?
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
we could n't have done it this time .
neither of us is that way .
oh i am sorry to hear that . i thought the truth was caused by the end of this year .
yeah . i know that .
i don t know that .
i 'm afraid it 's too hard to wash off the stain .
it 's really no wonder .
maybe such a good idea .
oh i do n't know .
but you did a good job .
do n't worry . everything will be fine .
how awful .
i agree with you . i m afraid he won t be elected .
i have thought of me .

oh my god . i feel terrible .
not bad . what about you ?
really ? i 've never heard of that before .
no . i 've go enough for it .

i hear that something is wrong with your mother .
i mean you .
how much did she cost ?
come on honey .
come on . you look really lucky .
well sounds like you have got everything .
i agree with him .
but he must be used to it .
i 'm not sure yet . who else ?
well our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive . i have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages .
there are lots of things to do .
i want you to miss her .
are you sure ? don t worry . they are going to be fine .
that is just what i mean .
that s a good idea . did you think of anything to eat ?

i d rather you typed it .

i d rather you told her .

ok . here 's the key . take care .
i will . thank you dad .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do it again .
try to be more careful in future .
i feel i really stupid .
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials ignite it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .
i did n't really like it .
mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
i found it very disappointing .
she liked the acting too because that 's what she wanted to see .
i was n't happy with it .

great ! how about it ?
no wait you will be too cold without mittens .
it s a pleasure . thank you for your help .
thank you . i hope i feel better .
thanks for your help . i 'll bring it back to my office tomorrow .
sounds like you 've done a good job .
sorry i certainly am .
i went to yale university .
did you ? and what did you study ?
i have a b . a . in economics .
would you mind telling me how old you are ?
i 'm twentyseven .
and could you tell me what other jobs you have had ?
yes i have worked in a bank for the last five years .
and what was your salary at the bank ?
i got 500 a week .
thank you . good evening mr . dean .
would you tell us your name please ?
i 'm helen baker .
glad to meet you ms . baker .
glad to meet you too .
where are you from ms . baker ?
i 'm from new zealand .
what do you do for a living ?
i m a sales manager in a publishing company .
thank you for coming ms . baker .
what kind of fun for you ?
good come over at ten o 'clock and we will start at the shopping center the one around the corner from my house . they have just the shop we need .
yeah let 's go together .
i do n't know where to go .
will that 'll be the sixth of september .
i m sure you can ask me . i ll be happy to see you then .
thank you . can i cancel my reservation ?
may be some other time .
today ?
i m sorry to hear that . shall we meet again ?
fine . thank you for your help .
what s wrong with you ?
no i have n't but i 've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper .
so you should go to the library right ?
i want to find a job in which i can utilize my experience .
you have n't had any experience in either of those fields .
i know . but i 'd like to try . look here are some advertisements that i 've cut out .
i was turned down again . it s frustrating . i guess you ve got to teach me some skills .
me ? i m even less experienced than you are .
at least you know what american women generally like in a man .
believe it or not i guess american women like a man in good shape which chinese women may not care about so much . that s my honest opinion . i know you have been trying very hard .
american men are naturally taller than chinese men . so even if i exercise there aren t many chances .
no that s not true . i ve met two american women who were married to chinese . but those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is jacky chan ? he s small and short . but i bet he can have any american woman he wants .
you know that s going to be a tremendous change for me . because i never exercise .
why don t you try then ? even if it doesn t help you find an american girl you could still have a stronger and healthier body . you won t lose anything by doing that .
hi don . what a surprise !
yeah i saw someone walking like you but i wasn t sure . we haven t seen each other for how long ? almost three months ? but you look quite different now .
have you noticed what has changed ?
oh you look quite slender and more <unk> . what have you been taking ? are you on a diet ?
yes . i m on a diet but i ve not taken anything . i just eat less and exercise more . and it really worked in the past three months . i ve lost twelve pounds .
wow ! that s great . i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals but it s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . also you know old habits are hard to break .
what kind of exercise do you think i do ? i just go to dance everyday after work . i m taking an amateur dance class . i dance two hours everyday .
dance ? you only go dancing ? that s not hard . i can do that .
sure . join my class next week .
excellent ! but i 'd love to .
and she 's good at sports too . she knows how to play tennis and basketball .
i m sorry .
gee . i am terribly sorry .
ok will that be ok ?
then you must be joking .
really ? have you got enough money ?
wait !
yes i hope so . but i want to get a master 's degree .
excuse me miss . now i ca n't believe it .
yes what do you think about this ?
wow !
you are a good student .
what ? i think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction .
let 's go ahead .
yes i 've been busy lately .
i know . but what 's wrong with you ?
listen to me .
oh i 'm worried about you . something terrible .
give me a break .
well why do n't you use a local sim card ?
oh i sometimes .
that s not a problem .
i have no idea !
no i 'm an engineer .
coming .
i want to see mine !
that 's smart !
checked it is . it was a tradition . . .
sounds like a good idea .
my pleasure ! i 'll bet it 's interesting .
wow . that sounds like a lot .
that sounds interesting .
i see . what kind of wine do i take ?
did n't you know that ?
yeah . i overheard your mom and my mom talking about me !
huh ?
make sure you buy what you need .
no not really .
really ? i can t believe that .
really ? how do you feel ?
i 'm afraid that i 'm very ill .
i think you know .
can i sit down now ?
it 's 24 .
in that case how much can i pay ?
don t worry about it . it s expensive .
i know . last year .
you need to print your name on this list .
that s what i need . thank you .
okay . i ll pick you up around 6
now we what is over there ?
it was a cake walk .
what s wrong with that ?
i can know that .
when you take something out of the stores you need to update the stores database so we know when to <unk> .
i 'm glad for the information .
all right . please fill in this form first .
no thank you for inviting me .
it 's a service charge .
i see .
you can never believe what he is going to do .
so what kind of backgrounds have ?
well it 's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . so unfortunately you 'll lose this 50 rib . we 'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .
i see . maybe you 're right .
really ? i 'm sorry .
yeah . i wanna go anyway . thanks .
so what 's the rush ?
i told you to get this consignment out last week . we ca n't very well run a light bulb conference without any light bulbs can we ? what am i going to do with you ?
could you tell me what the roses are for ?
aright . see you later .
yeah it really was nice talking about you .
i would n't agree with me .
i have n't even told you about it .
well in the case i think we will be more careful .
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
oh how do you do ?
thank you . here 's a present for you .
nothing thanks . i think i could be a better job .
you don t have a car ?
do you have any suggestions ?
fine just get it !
oh it looks great . everyone told me about it .
really ? come on it 's not far from here .
where will we hire you ?
it 's a recruiting agency .
yeah . but you won t be able to speak it well .
they have a good taste !
that is a bit lower than i expected .
yes it is . there are a walkin closet .
when is the bathroom ?
so how s it going to be ?
the day after tomorrow .
let me have a look . well . . .
when will you give me a raise ?
it could be interesting .
of course otherwise you ll just have to wait for hours .
i think in some way it is an act of god but in another way it just is caused by us .
what happened to us ?
for example some countries restrict imports by <unk> restriction .
oh i see . fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things .
really ? that 's a straws in the wind .
i think so . maybe he 's fallen for her .
yeah . they suit each other . a perfect match between a man and a girl .
how much do you mean ?
oh you know . . .
let me have a look .
i just want to thank you for the encouragement .
alright . i know how to spend your food .
what else do you eat ?
that sounds okay .
what are you doing ?
i apologize . i do n't eat any food .
the restaurant is rather good . what about that ?
fantastic !
beefsteak very much . have you tried chinese dishes ?
does he have a crush on you ?
that makes sense . chinese food is so important to me .
really ? what is the price ?
that 's fate .
i feel sorry for her .
maybe this is god 's will .
we have two cleaning ladies . but both of them have received little education .
most cleaning ladies are illiterate . but some of them do a very nice job .
but i actually dislike another lady . she is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . but the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . she would tell you what to do and where to put things .
well i am a little bit out of shape . i think i should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ?
but it 's fun .
your daughter is a wonderful student .
we provide uptodate training on state of the art equipment .
thank you for doing that .
well we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . the trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the workout plan .
that 's great . thanks for your help .
they may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you ?
that 's a good idea .
it depends on what you mean .
perhaps one month . i 'll just have a try at first .
that 's right . i do n't know anything about it .
yes . i 'm fond of playing the chess and i 'm very keen on playing cards .
oh that s interesting and but what kind of things ?
several things for example various coins stamps stones and so on .
stones ? i know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?
yes stones .
well i can t just image it .
i am glad to see you .
i do n't know . but i hope you will do a good job .
i do n't know how to help you .
well good luck .
oh don t worry .
i can hold it over for you .
so have you been on the bus very long ?
oh it 's been uh . . . fifteen minutes .
come on mom .
oops !
i know .
pcc is wonderful !
i like science .
yes a little breeze for a while .
what ? i thought you liked patricia .
that 's what i think .
do n't worry . no big deal .
perfect .
really ? i ca n't believe it .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
i 'm looking forward to it . but can you tell me why ?
what else can you see ?
we could learn more . in fact i do n't understand that .
that 's a great opportunity . i 'm sure you can do better .
oh it s easy to learn .
do you bring your id ?
i do n't think you 'll find it .
i want to go and find one .
thank you for your compliment .
maybe you 're right . i will try it . but i just ca n't stand it .
i 'm okay .
anyway it 's easy .
damn i had to watch a movie .
really ? that 's very important .
i hope to study english literature .
by the way if i can help you prepare for it .
alright i will try my best .
can you help me in english ?
what ?
so you can buy it now .
really ? but it seems like the weather .
they will be advertising .
sure . but you know that i ca n't read any chinese characters . what do they say ?
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
it 's interesting and i want to buy one home .
let 's get started .
oh yeah . it deserves its name .
sure . how about take a look then ?
darling i know . what 's wrong with it ?
i believe it 's interesting .
great ! let 's get started .
i know . let 's go to the library right now .
yesterday ?
i am grateful for your advice .
do you have any other questions ?
sounds like a good idea .
do you mind if i fill out this form ?
great idea ! how are you going to do it ?
good . thank you for your advice .
good idea . let 's do it .
do n't you have any hobbies ?
you can get a rabbit .
the only way is there ?
oh i see . by the way did you read it ?
they do .
ok i will never do that .
it must be very convenient and pretty quick .
let 's stop talking about it .
i ca n't see it .
you like the food there ?
maybe we could find a book .
the food there ?
yes . but i could n't believe it .
we can sit down here .
no . i saw him once .
yes you can find it at school .
how about the lyrics ?
do n't worry about it .
sounds interesting .
for fun yes .
thanks . goodbye then .
by the way how many companies do you need to know ?
hmm . . .
video tape breaks down after fifteen years . so if he collects a lot of tapes after fifteen years they will all start to rot .
i can ride myself .
yes . it is one of the biggest cities . many countries have from all over the world .
what would you like for a drink ?
is friday good ?
what is it ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
i like all sorts of movies primarily drama and science fiction .
the taj ?
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
i care what you mean .
what 's that movie ?
is it going to rain soon ?
bill and betty have already grown up .
do n't worry . i can do it .
look at that big tree over there .
yeah oh my god ! it s still there . we have our first date right on there .
do you know that i fell in love with you at the first sight then ?
you seemed to be dull at that time .
but you agreed to go out with me at last .
smile i can t believe this for it s been 20 years since we got married .
what 's available ?
no problem . but i 'm afraid it 's time .
i feel that way .
that 's great .
oh really ? that 's nice of you .
what other kind of food do you like ?
oh you know there 's nothing .
good luck . i want to see it .
the name is excellent for me .
that 's true .
sounds like what you see .
yeah . what time ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
the change is no . 14 .
it sounds good . i 'll see you then .
oh right . he is not a fine wether friend who could sell you down the river .
i was thinking of her .
i ca n't agree with you .
it 's martin <unk> . you liked his film the departed did n't you ?
where is he ?
you did n't he ?
certainly .
i love him too .
there s so much i want to do . i ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . i just ran a search for music to download .
i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
thanks . that would be very helpful . i ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . there s too much information on the net .
when you sent your emails did you attach any files to them ?
yes i did . there s an antivirus programme with my email account that <unk> all attachments so i m sure i haven t sent anything nasty to anyone .
when you use the internet be careful not to give out your email address very often . if you do you might get a lot of <unk> email form companies trying to sell you things .
that s good advice . i should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself such as my password and credit car number .
that s right . another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time
how do i do that ?
take this web page for example . press the keys control and d together . click on favourites at the top of the screen . there you are . it has been added to you favourites list . if you click it you will
that s useful to know . thanks . i ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .
really ? i m not sure that i would like all the attention . there have been numerous cases of paparazzi <unk> with star s private live in recent years .
i love being <unk> ! if i were famous i d do interviews for all the top magazines like cosmo and elle .
i wouldn t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice but it would get tedious after a while . imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you .
noone really believes gossip columnists .
i think you ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . you d also have to be very careful about every word you said . if you <unk> on a chat show and said something silly it
i think you re right about that . i d need a good manager to be my <unk> . i could do a lot of charity work which would help a lot of people .
that s a great idea . which charities would you support ?
i love children as you know so probably a children s charity .
you d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity so you d really need to be very careful . anyway i d be the first to buy your posters and i d attend your first book
thanks but i was hoping i could ask you to write my biography .
yes it is . thanks . i m just surfing on the internet .
here ? in this cafe ? how can you do that ?
this cafe offers a wireless internet connection . that means i can get on the net for free while i m here . of course i have to buy a cup of coffee !
that s great . can you do it anywhere ?
no . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . there are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
so what programs do you have on your laptop ?
i ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs .
i know you are keen on photography . it s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone anywhere at a
it s wonderful isn t it ? would you like to see some photos that i took recently ?
yes i do . i also use an antispyware program and a firewall . there are so many <unk> on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . you have to be very c
how often do you run your antivirus program ?
i usually run it every few days . it finds a virus about half the time .
which antivirus program would you recommend ?
have you tried this one ? it s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . you can also download updates for free .
that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ?
just a minute . . . go to this one . i ll send you an email with the line in it . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the set up procedures . but they are not complicated .
what do you use your computer for ?
i use it for several thingssurfing the net word processing and creating presentations . i don t play many games on my computer but i do a lot of work with photographs . using a computer program you
computers are great aren t they ? i should download some programs and learn how to use them .
i use it almost every day but i usually only use it to check my email . i don t often surf the net . you use the internet a lot don t you ?
yes . i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . it can be frustrating when the connection is poor .
so you re online eight hours a day .
yes i like the job though . sometimes i help other people in the office if they re having trouble online .
how useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?
i think it s fairly useful but there are two big problems . first a lot of the information you find online is false . second when you buy something online you don t see it until you actually get it .
how do you solve the website problems when you re buying something online ?
what i do is find the website of shops . then someone from our company <unk> the shop and buys when they re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .
i d say the main reason is poverty . countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . if their neighbors have some resources they try to steal them by military force .
it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end .
how do you think they could be ended ?
i do n't think they 're right .
so if the cause is poverty there should be a programme to make the country richer . if the problem is resources share them .
it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality it 's harder to make peace between countries .
yes . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .
the problem is that many poor people might suffer .
would you like to live in the country ? i m not sure i d like it .
i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that for me each advantage has its own disadvantage .
but there are a lot of choices .
when you take something out of the stores you need to update the stores database so we know when to <unk> .
i agree with you . people in the city life seems to be quiet and peaceful .
people can t have it both ways . if you live in the country it is often less convenient . if you live in a city it is noisy buy there s more to do .
i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they re so much better to look at than concrete rows of parked cars and tall buildings .
i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . when the wind blows in the city you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .
the view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . there s so sign of pollution . the village looks so peaceful .
just remember that in that village there s nothing to do . there s not even a pub or restaurant . there s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .
you re right . i would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . i would hate living in the country !
come on . it 's not my fault .
sorry . i m a nurse .
are you kidding ?
you know you do n't like it ?
have you considered the gift ?
but the ads don t feel so bad .
for example some countries restrict imports by <unk> restriction .

why not ! it s a classic in fact it s one of my favorite novels .
but it s so old .
don t judge a book by its cover . do you kwon what it s about ?
no not at all .
first of all it s a romance novel set in the early 19th century .
i didn t realize it was a romance novel .
it s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .
why does he want to do that ?
since he doesn t have a son he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . that way all of his daughters will be cared for .
won t they get his inheritance ?
no that s the problem . though they are welloff once he dies his house will go to his cousin . so when he dies the girls will have nothing .
i see . this sounds interesting !
so are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
there s movie ? my teacher didn t tell me that !
that s probably because she wants you to read the book first .
it would take a lot less time . .
how about this . when you finish the book . i ll get the movie and watch it with you .
ok . that sounds like a deal .
i only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . i don t think that tv is bad for kids . i think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes .
perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first .
if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch remember to have something else for them to do . if you don t they ll get bored and misbehave .
they could go out and play with their friends .
sure . you could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time .
perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . he watches too much tv too .
that s a good idea . remember that if the parents watch too much tv the kids will probably follow suit .
i like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . but i don t like traveling to work waiting for buses or . . .
or getting stuck in traffic jams when you re driving .
i think something must be done .
it 's gone with the wind .
why do you like it best ?
i enjoy the various characters and the plot .
well . i like the thorn birds best .
have you got a sample ?
sure . i like the writer 's language too .
if i have a chance i 'll enjoy the book .
would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
that 's a good idea . let s go !
it 's the best seller everyone 's been talking about for the last six months .
how in the world did you get a copy ? i 've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i 'm still waiting my turn .
i checked it out of the rental library . it only costs five cents a day .
is it really worth paying for ?
i ca n't tell yet . i have n't got beyond the first chapter .
if it 's any good i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
not a great deal .
i 've just been reading an article about them . they ll be used for all sorts of things now .
for accounting system and things like that you mean ?
yes but they are used for other things too . do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to paris .
wait a minute . i can take the bus .
i was just thinking about someone i went to school with this boy i was quite friendly with in third grade . we used to hang out together he lived next door but then my parents moved and i changed schools and never saw him again .
of course his machine must have been connected to a computer .
i did this .
really ? i have been working too hard .
that s a good idea . did you think of anything to do ?
when you take something out of the stores you need to update the stores database so we know when to <unk> .
it 's true .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
oh what s he like ?
well he s got dark hair and brown eyes .
when did he wear glasses ?
what would you like for a drink ?
um that s good .
yes but he s got a wife and 3 children as well .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .
what happened ? you look so pale .
it 's the end of the world for me .
is there anything else you 'd like to drink ?
well i just need to make and receive calls and it 's quite reliable . i find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong you know ? i mean this camera function for instancehow often do you use it ?
oh that 's too bad . work harder next term .
b i 'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me .
do n't lose heart . everything will be fine .
are you sure ?
yes of course . this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
i m glad you re enjoying it .
thank you for the invitation .
it s my pleasure . can i get you another glass of champagne ?
yes please . thank you for everything .
sorry i can t .
tomorrow night then ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
that s sounds great .
ok . how about give me a ring then ?
no . i d better not .
isn t it ?
video tape breaks down after fifteen years . so if he collects a lot of tapes after fifteen years they will all start to rot .
i m looking at my horoscope for this month ! my outlook is very positive . it says that i should take a vacation to someplace exotic and that i will have a passionate summer fling !
what are you talking about ? let me see that . . . what are <unk> ?
it s a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign . you have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . i was born on april 15th so i m an aries . when were you born ?
ok january 5th .
let s see . . . you re a capricorn . it says that you will be feeling stress at work but you could see new exciting developments in your love life . looks like we ll both have interesting summers !
that s bogus . i do n't feel any stress at work and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
no it s not your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . see ? it says that an aries is energetic and loves to socialize .
well you certainly match those criteria but they re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ?
a capricorn is <unk> and practical . she likes to do things in conventional ways . that sounds just like you !
ok ! how about <unk> ?
no no a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . i m going to describe someone s face and you guess who it is !
are you sure ?
and that 's it . you 're done .
our cousin pete ! my turn !
aunt rose ! that mole is so huge ! ok my turn . he has a crooked nose and full lips . he has quite a few freckles and an oval face . oh he is also bald !
your future husband !
not funny .
i 'm trying to learn new skills . it makes me more qualified for a good job .
mumm . no .
it s only the day when the world s biggest sporting event is kicking off .
i will be . heard that it s time for the national olympics .

that s both fortunate and unfortunate . it s the united nations in my class ! we have people from all over the world ! there are three germans a pole a scottish two french an american a brazilian

well i think you re pretty lucky actually . you ll have the opportunity to learn so much about asian culture .
i guess so but i think it s going to be hard to relate to my classmates especially with the language barrier . i think i might change classes .
don t ! stay the course ! your spoken chinese will be eternally grateful . i bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice .
i highly doubt it . your girlfriend is chinese .
well there is that yes .

i 'm not sure what about you ?

not bad . what about you ?

it 's been a long time has n't it ?
it 's hard to say .
brian . how are you ?
thank you li mei . this is so nice .
and what would you like to drink ?
i haven t thought about it for a long time .

i will .
good idea ! i have to do something to help my company .
let 's check out the fruit section first .
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
i hope so .
yes .

i love the fish . thank you .

i was thinking we should go to the movies .
coco lee .

i like to play computer games .
non please .
what would you like to have ?
just today .
i have n't . i 'm still working on it .
i 'll think about you .
really ? i have a try .
hi john ! i have n't seen you for ages .
yeah i 've been out of town .
so how have you been ?
great ! work is really busy now but it 's fun .
it 's true . don t worry .
oh i 'm glad you came .
of course sir . but we 'll pay you back as soon as possible .
i agree . let 's go .
hey andrew . how 's everything with work ?
ok i guess . my boss has been on my back recently .
really ? what 's he been doing ?
you know just giving me lots to do . i 'm really busy right now .
are you ? what are you busy with ?
oh lots of things . mostly training new people .
yeah ! we ca n't live together .
by the way ?
i 'm the excellent team . what can i do for you ?
you know . . .
good idea . what about you ?
let me help you .
good luck out there .
at 10 o 'clock .
how about football ?
thanks for saying that .
ok ! let 's call it a deal .
that 's great . let 's go !
yeah i think so . oh by the way i need to ask you something .
like this ?
one of our qualified teachers will interview you so that they can find a class that suits you best .
sure . oh that reminds me . could i borrow your black leather boots ?
my boots ? er . . . sure ok .
we 'd like to go to tianjin .
are you sure she will be happy ?
yes we used to . that was wonderful .
it sounds great to me .
forget it . she s a beautiful girl .
are there any of them like that ?
thank you for the warning .
in what way can you tell me ?
george how can we ? vacations cost money . and this month we don t have much money left after paying the rent .
well lili we can visit different places in the state in our van . we are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . trust me it won t cost much .
where will we sleep then ?
in the van .
what about other expenses ?
let s see . gas food recreation we won t spend much . come on . don t hesitate . we need to get out of the house once in a while . we have been working hard haven t we ?
maybe you re right . when do you plan to go ?
the sooner the better ! i can t wait !
oh i don t know where we re going yet .
as long as we re going you can decide where to go . i trust your <unk> . i know you miss chinese food so we can eat at a chinese restaurant this time .
let s go to chicago . we can have lunch in chinatown . then we can go to a ball game at <unk> field !
that s a good idea . you can try it .
i found the ideal position . i m working for a plumbing company .
are you serious ? you studied mathematics at college for four years and now you have a job working with your hands !
plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge and creativity . i love this job .
i can see that . but i didn t know you had experience in that line of work .
i didn t but i applied for an apprenticeship and since i studied math and i have a good attitude 4 my application was accepted .
congratulations ! you do have the right attitude .
did you have something in mind ?
oh it 's just the cows that are grazing over there . we can milk them later .
that s a good idea . i m sure you can find a nice view of the park .
do n't be silly .
i have nothing to do .
really ? how could you say that ?
oh really . i like playing basketball .
you ve got a fever and playing football isn t a good idea .
and she 's good at sports too . she knows how to play tennis and basketball .
yes i 've read it carefully .
i think i m pretty good at networking . are you crazy ?
well i prefer to play basketball .
really ? how do you play tennis ?
i know . why ?
what else can i do ?
palmistry ? what is that ?
it 's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future .
oh you mean palm reading . i 've seen that before but i do n't believe in it .
are you sure ? i 've read a lot about palmistry and i 've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . do you want me to take a look at your hand ?
really ? you 've read books about it ? ok then . but only if you want to .
ok let 's see well you 've got a long life line which is good and the love line is strong . . .
what else do you see ? will i be successful ? will i make a lot of money ?
hmm hard to say wait yes it looks like you will do well in business and your ambition will help you a lot but . . .
what ? what is it ? what 's the matter ?
you seem to have a large gullibility line . you believe everything that you 're told .
they 're cute .
no not really . why do you ask ?
because i want to tell you about the time that i saw a ghost .
you saw a ghost ? when ?
it was many years ago when i was a little child . it was the middle of the night and i went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . i walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs when . . .
so that 's where you saw the ghost ? in your house ? what did it look like ? was it hideous ?
it was a big green thing that looked like a person . it was in the kitchen and it slowly moved towards the stairs . . .
what 's the kitchen plumbing like ?
when i entered the room i forgot to close the door .
until what ? what happened ? did you see it clearly ? did it attack you ?
it moved slowly up the stairs step by step and i could hear its approaching footsteps . when it finally got to the top of the stairs i realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . he had gone to get a late night snack .
i just found out that my husband is cheating on me .
you mean mark ? he seems like such an honest guy .
that 's what i thought . it seems that he 's been seeing someone else for about two months .
two months ? how did you find out ?
i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . i picked it up and a girl asked to talk to mark . she then asked if i was his sister and i said no i was his wife . she hung up immediately .
so you asked him about the girl who called ?
yeah he first said it was someone from work . he gave me a lame excuse and so i pressed him on it .
what 'd he do ?
he kept trying to make stupid excuses and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion .
i 'm so sorry to hear that .
three months .
it is sad .
i think my husband would be better .
thanks i did n't notice it .
exactly what is it ?
are you sure you enjoy your workout ?
why you have that ?
i think the most important thing is that you should do is fair .
well i feel that you have a lot of homework .
no i haven t . but it s not for me .
ok i ve got it .
actually i do n't like playing basketball .
nothing much .
it 's important that it has a good idea to eat chinese food .
good idea . i 'm always willing to help .
it 's 14 .
i ca n't agree with you .
it 's painful because you can go to school tomorrow .
yeah i love it .
is there anything else that we can do ?
how do you pay for it ?
i 'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments .
tell me if you need help .
no i am not eating there anymore . i have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . the food served in the cafeteria is not my type . i am a total meat lover . but the chinese cabbage
that s fine with me . i don t hate vegetables and i don t eat much during lunch .
well then the cafeteria suits you best . but anyway if you like to have a lunch outside the company feel free to join me anytime .
i 'm going to graduate this summer .
where are you going to work then in australia or back in china ?
i 'm planning to return to china after graduation .
why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad .
well i think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment .
yeah china 's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country .
of course ! it is the no . 1 <unk> in my life . you know job stress has become a very common problem these days . so we must learn to cope with it .
totally agree . what is your solution ?
well there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress both we and the companies should do something . for me i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know all work and no play make jack a dull boy .
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
but i don t think we can change our working condition . anyway we are not the bosses .
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them like <unk> <unk> deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
no he might . sometimes i do n't understand .
so you wo n't have a problem with it ?
no they had no reason for arresting me .
but what ?
what about the employees ?
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is really cute .
yes next march .
vacation time .
hold on . what 's wrong with you ?
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
saturday night ?
me too . i guess we 'll just go to the movies tonight .
great . let 's go .
your usual shirt and shoes .
why do n't you try it on ?
i agree . but let s go .
the style is all right but i 'm not sure about the color . let me think for a while .
let 's go out for a moment .
so what were you calling me about ?
i 'm going to call you .
i 'm serious .
all right . next time you will treat .
great ! i 'll take a walk .
you are right . to prepare it a sichuan food chef first fries some chilli until they turn <unk> .
well thanks . i know that it 's interesting .
i 'll take friday then .
i don t care . give me up !
i am afraid that i have made a mistake .
follow me . i love it .
thank you for your advice . i do n't think it 's boring .
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda .
oh i do n't think you 're right .
i had my first cigarette when i was 17 .
that sounds reasonable . i 'll ring you then .
it 's just the cows that are grazing over there . we can milk them later .
that 's easy . i do n't know what she likes .
supervisor . open the door .
let 's go and have a look .
what would i do ?
sure . i 'll be back soon .
have you got a temperature ?
why do n't you go out to eat ?
i would n't mind a burger .
i do n't suppose i could .
i don t think i d like to go to bed early . i do n't know what i should do .
how terrible !
yeah like it very much .
well because you did n't have any problems . what ?
no . not at all .
yes . he usually did it .
how sweet ! !
what do you say ?
that sounds like a good idea .
something important ?
i have no idea .
what dress should i wear ?
sorry but he 's busy then too .
i ll try him .
what did you recommend ?
i like spring best .
i prefer summer especially the summer evenings . when the sun comes down it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . after a rain shower the smell of the air is refreshing . it is also a best reason for icecream .
how do you get through the stuffy daytime ?
well i have to hide in the airconditioned rooms . anyway it is all worth just think about the cool evening time .
fantastic ! i enjoy clubbing especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad full of smoke and the music is too loud so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
how did that happen ?
a wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . if i had drunk enough and i would have had the bold to punch him in the face .
sounds cool ! but that is not what a lady should do . people are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk .
oh that sounds great !
why don t you work overtime ?
that seems like a good idea .
yeah i did . i saw a science program . it was quite interesting .
what are you going to do about it ?
they did .
really ? you don t look very chinese to me if you don t mind me saying so .
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
wonderful !
anne ! i have n't seen you for ages . how 've you been ?
hello i 'm fine . i 've been out of town . i just got back from london .
not bad . it really is great to see you again . w here have you been ?
i 've been busy lately .
better take the subway . it s faster and more convenient .
en where do we pay the fares ?
we have a rather comprehensive subway system here . you can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy .
it could be that .
we should go to the ticket office .
i see . how much does that cost ?
cash credit card or debit card ?
yes of course . it 's quite far from here .
i have no idea .
you wo n't have to pay the fine .
is that so ? i did n't know it . can i possibly borrow a jacket and a tie ?
i am sorry you ca n't borrow a jacket and a tie .
then we 'll return to the hotel and come back will you change the appointment ?
certainly what time will you come back ?
at 7 please .
here 's ten yuan .
a party of 13 .
that 's wonderful .
er . . . hum . . . got it .
then open that window . yeah that one .
right !
and that 's it . you 're done .
i see what you mean . that was pretty easy after all .
no it is n't .
oh . thank you .
you are welcome . i hope you have a good trip .
oh he s a terrible guy .
i just lost my job . my boss just told me .
that 's unbelievable . why did this happen ?
i do n't understand of myself . it seems they have to save money .
i cant't believe it . you 've worked here for years .
it 's true . don t worry .
oh i 'm glad you came .
of course sir . but we 'll pay you back as soon as possible .
i agree . let 's go .
not yet . what 's the matter ?
that 's terrible .
i just don t want to play table tennis any more .
emm . . . yes . but i was n't too impressed . i found her a little stuck up .
you are kidding but she 's so helpful .
tom . . . you are her boss you down . of course she 's helpful to you .
come on . she 's like that with everyone .
i do n't think so actually . she never even says hello to me .
thank you . but a number of things have been going wrong lately .
that 's too bad . what problems are you having .
oh the whole house needs repainting for starters . the carpet in the living room is worn out and i 'd like to put in new walltowall carpeting . last week i had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . anyway all par for the course when you own a house i guess . i think i am going to hire an interior <unk> to look the place over .
i 've studied home decoration as a hobby .
sure . that s a problem .
open your mouth and show me your tongue . say ah . . . you have a bad cold . so you must stay in bed for a week .
that 's a great idea . thanks for the suggestions .
you are welcome jack . glad to be of help .
oh i did n't know it .
that s a good idea . why did you ask you a couple of months ?
i do n't think it was the director of the movie .
maybe you are right .
hi angela it 's dan .
please allow me to introduce myself . my name is tom .
pleased to meet you . my name is alice . did you just move in next door ?
yes i did . have you lived here long ?
me ? i guess so . i 've lived here for about six years now . have you lived in america very long ?
no not really . when i left vietnam i came to america and i lived with a cousin in dallas for two years . where do you work alice ?
i teach mathematics at a college . what do you do ?
i am an accountant at a company .
well tom . it 's good to meet you . i have to go now . i am teaching a class this evening and i need to get to the college .
it 's nice meeting you too alice .
see you around !
goodbye alice .
thank you . it 's a pleasure to meet you .
a pleasure meeting you as well the flowers are for you .
thank you they are beautiful .
yeah i know . i 've tried hard to quit smoking .
can you trust me ?
ok . all right .
i 'm sure i can help you .
so are you worried about anything ?
thank you for reminding me . i do n't care about that .
do n't worry .
i think you 'll find it .
that 's very clear .
perhaps it sounds like a cold .
what s the problem ?
i did n't sleep a wink last night .
did you have something on your mind ? you look so concerned ! maybe i can help you .
well i 'm under a lot of pressure . my boss is very pushy . he assigned me two projects . now the deadlines are near and i still have n't finish one of them .
that 's very sad .
yes thank you . i am really far behind on this project . could you help me with the extra typing or xeroxing ?
a checkup . i had a really sore throat .
can i help you ?
he took all my things but he did n't hurt me .
oh shut up ! you do n't have to worry about me .
i was in it for almost a couple of days .
sounds like you had a good journey .
thanks for reminding me .
perhaps you d better go to bed then . we can go to the doctor and have a look at it .
no . i do n't . we can take care of it .
yeah the government really takes a bite doesn t it ?
no . it is .
yeah i don t mind it either .
yeah . it won t be much but at least we ll have a monthly check when we get old .
yeah . my grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive .
let s just hope the politicians don t figure out a way to spend it .
really ? i have never thought about it before .
well that was an odd change of subject .
what time was it ?
i wanted to be the monitor .
of course not help yourself .
well i think you should go to the movies this weekend .
laura .
do you like this place ?
i don t think it s very nice . and my father doesn t like it . but my mother likes it very much . so we often come here .
how often ?
three times a year at most . how do you feel about this ?
who s that ?
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
do you like swimming ?
yes . swimming is one of my most favorite sports indoors or outdoors .
that 's interesting i like being an editor .
it 's interesting .
yes .
why did you think of that ?
i need to think about that .
so how will you go ?
we re in luck .
why ?
you re kidding . i guess that s what i can do .
i understand .
waiter please .
hmm i 'd like to see it .
i think i 'll have a glass of orange juice please .
thank you . i 'll bring your order right away .
sounds good .
that 's ok . i think they 've done better .
wine please .
what about this dress ?
they are very simple .
where shall we sit ?
yes most of the time .
pretty good .
you look so nice .
sure do you know what you mean .
what kind would you like ?
then i owe you one .
i grow a variety of things so that something is in bloom all year round .
when is your garden at its best ?
it looks best in spring when the plum and cherry blossoms are out .
i 'm traveling . i will go to the city 's . what should i do ?
i hope i don t ever see you back in school .
i want to go to work .
oh how long will you be here ?
i think studying spanish would be better .
you 're right . thank you for your help .
tasha mountain ? it 's very famous in china is n't it ?
i 'd prefer a morning flight .
my house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture .
no wonder you look so upset . have you called the police ?
yes i have . but i have to wait .
i know what you mean .
well our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive . i have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages .
it sounds so beautiful .
i could but where 's the fun in that ?
when you take something out of the stores you need to update the stores database so we know when to <unk> .
okay i did n't think about it .
it 's beautiful . enjoy it while it lasts . it 's supposed to get cold tomorrow .
what 's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
it 's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there 's a chance of freezing rain .
that does n't sound pretty .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
well i was going to drive to birmingham to see some friends .
you might want to change your plans . with the cold and wet weather that we 're supposed to have tomorrow the roads are going to be rather slippery .
i suppose i should . i do n't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
i just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
if you 're lucky it 'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !
if that happens then i 'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
that 's fine . i 'll talk to you later .
it s a fun job .
english weather is even more predictable than i had previously thought .
yes ma 'am . i 'm really sorry .
so what about you ?
i 'm trying to learn new skills . it makes me more qualified for a good job .
how old is he today ?
it 's his 50th birthday .
well wish him a happy birthday for me .
sure thing . what are your plans for the evening ?
i was just thinking of going to a movie tonight .
well if you can wait until tomorrow night i 'll go with you then .
sorry i 've got people coming over tomorrow night .
sounds like this weekend just is n't going to work out for us .
sounds that way . maybe some other time then ?
sure . hey i 'm sorry but i 've got to get going .
yeah me too . it 's about time i made a move .
say hello to your friends for me .
likewise . see you later .
hi basil .
it 's beethoven . do you like it ?
i think beethoven's music is incredible . i 've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent too . do you believe that ?
i do n't know about that but i do think that it helps people relax .
what other kind of music do you listen to ?
actually i mostly just listen classical music . what about you ?
to be honest i think classical music is too complicated for me .
what kind of music do you prefer then ?
i like pop music . do you ?
not really . i do n't think pop music has much depth .
i see what you mean . i think that 's way i like it so much .
how long have you been in to pop music then ?
i 've always been into it . have you always liked classical music ?
not really . when i was little we did n't really listen to music at all .
so how did you become interested in it ?
well when i was about 10 years old i started playing the piano . i think that 's how it all started .
do you still play piano ?
yes it 's one of my hobbies .
what kind of movie is it ? i don t like many of his movies actually .
it s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead .
i like thrillers and i like julia roberts so it might be interesting . i read a review today and the critic didn t seem to be very impressed .
what did the critic say ?
he didn t say it was bad but he said that it wasn t as good as it could have been particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it .
the movie starts at eight o clock so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
good . dinner is nearly ready and i d like to watch the news before we go . the oscars were last night and i want to see the results .
i won t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . there were a few surprises .
i like current affairs programs and documentaries especially wildlife ones . how about you ?
i like those kinds of programs too . they re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
i agree . people often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence .
yeah . and that s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !
right . you can t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . they need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs .
i think i have time to go about the advertisements that can be shown . i think it s about six minutes per hour .
that s great idea . but don t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?
no . they don t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ?
not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! that s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv where you pay a fixed amount each month .
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country but people don t seem to keen to pay for their tv programs . besides the <unk> channels offer a good range of programs .
well there s a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes . shall we ?
it s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . i play the part of the detective . he has to catch the killer but there s very little evidence . it s a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes but i hope audience won t be too scared to go to the movie theatres !
did you enjoy making the movie ? we heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director .
i have had disagreement with every director . i ve worked with . we ve always <unk> in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . it was the same when i made this movie . i don t know where <unk> of my disagreement with rachel kelly come from . we got on very well and i hope to work with her again . i enjoyed making the movie very much .
that s what kind of critics are not good at the movies ?
not at all . the feedback from audience has been great . i care about what they think more than what the critics think .
did you own stunts in the movie ?
i wanted to but my insurance company wouldn t let me . all of my stunts were done by a <unk> . as you know i used to do my own stunts but i ll leave that to the experts in future .
thank you very much for doing this interview .
my pleasure . have you seen the movie yet ?
yes . i have . i liked it very much . like you i was very impressed with rachel s performance in the movie . she s going to be a star .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
why do n't you try doing that again ?
i love you too .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
yes i experienced one when i was in tokyo once . the tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over .
do you know where it measured on the richter scale ?
i do n't remember but it was n't very serious . have you ever been in an earthquake ?
no but i was in quite a few tornados when i was younger .
have you ever experiences a flood ?
i am still in xyz company this meeting took longer than i expected . say to it that the office manager knows i won t be in to punch my card .
did your house ever get damaged from the winds ?
most of the time we were lucky but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room .
wow that must have really been scary .
actually some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass .
have you ever experiences a flood ?
no but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
that sure did n't last long !
i 'm doing well and you ?
what happened to him ?
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
was it his first offence ?
unfortunately not . he was charged with a <unk> when he was in university .
what happened to him then ?
not much it was a minor offence back then . he got away with a fine of 500 .
did they take his license away ?
no they were really easy on him . the problem is that that was a long time ago . they are much tougher on crime now .
what do you think will happen to him ?
well he 'll definitely lose his license pay a fine and maybe even spend some time in jail .
that does n't sound too promising . does he have a defence lawyer ?
not yet . if we ca n't find a lawyer for him then the state will appoint him with one .
my sister is a lawyer . i can ask her if she can help him .
that 'd be great ! i know he 'd appreciate your help .
i think housing is a big problem . there are thousands of homeless people on the streets .
how would you solve the problem ?
i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .
it would probably be very expensive .
i think the government can afford it . besides there are many advantages . homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement .
it s not a bad idea . i think education is the biggest problem at the moment . schools don t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly .
if we are to invest more money to education we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn t be popular with voters .
most voters what everything bout ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things but without increasing taxes .
the government should show that it is using money efficiently .
yes . the government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly .
could n't be better .
i forgot to explain it in detail .
that 's why i like to do it .
i started to buy a new perfume for ten dollars .
i think it 's because .
i do n't know . i think the price is good .
yeah . i used to buy one home now .
i had no idea i ran out .
cash or charge ?
that 's true .
it 's possible .
i think the idea of that .
i think it 's a lot of dad . but most of my children would live in the city .
why not ?
i really ca n't believe it . i broke them all by one day .
well now you 're lucky . what can you do ?
then what would you do ?
what are you going to do ?
yes . i 'll just have a look .
who was it ?
well i didn t know that .
what exactly does the flight cost ?
but i should have aced it . i mean i finished the paper so quickly thinking it 's a piece of cake . but when i knew my result i was like what ? that ca n't be true !
it 's a bit expensive .
not really . but i ca n't afford it .
congratulations !
i m going to the cinema .
what kind of room would you like to have ?
no it 's a pity .
i love it .
yes of course . how do you want to know ?
nothing .
are there any bonuses ?
we had three kinds of dressings for salad . italian french and thousand island .
really ? you 're quite good . i 'll learn how to help you .
here you go honey fried eggs .
what 's he doing ?
the one smoking a cigar .
when did it happen ?
why did you attack the victim ?
person a comes out of the dressing room how did you like the sweater ?
when are you going to start ?
why do you prefer to ask ?
good timing ! i 'll tell him .
well . i ca n't know .
i need to make a statement at the police station .
calm down . i 'm not good at it .
don t worry . i ll call you later .
well if i were you i would go to the police station .
ok . i have to think about it .
believe me . everything will be ok .
yes that 's a good idea .
good question . i have to think about it .
good question . i have to think about it .
ok . i have to think about it .
what 's on tonight ?
so you write your name and member number at the top of the card .
one way .
no kidding ! we have only 5 bottles of beer .
that 's good advice . i have to think about it .
why ? do n't you ?
if you want to smoke you 'll have to prepare for it .
i feel uncomfortable .
no problem . give me one more time .
i feel uncomfortable .
what if there 's a problem ?
oh really ? i love it .
mom ! i do n't think of something . but i 've never seen a woman .
well they 're on sale today for only 1 each .
i think so . i want to buy something online .

let 's play other game .
oh no ! what did i do ?
why do n't you ask them ?
well i have n't been to the theater in a long time .
good question . i have to think about it .
yeah . but we used to it .
yes . i usually do n't care about it .
hi linda ! how have you been ?
yeah i 'm doing fine . i don t know anyone .
don t be sad . everything will be fine .
they have anything on sale ?
good . then can you tell me something about the college ?
you know what ?
it 's so interesting . what do you think of him ?
how do you get along with your boss ?
he is very angry with you .
to be honest i do n't mind helping you .
not bad . what about you ?
that 's nice .
4 persons .
i ca n't live with you .
i did n't know you were a brother .
did n't you ? what 's wrong with it ?
do you have anything else to do ?
i really like for one . i don t think that they re so young .
what is the matter with you ?
that 's a good idea .
very bad . when can we get him ?
thank you . my family has lived here for three years .
glad that you like it .
then let 's go into the shall we ?
were you ?
how about this one ? it 's quite fashionable .
i ca n't believe it . i 'm just glad to talk to her .
ma 'am ?
we can go .
well you just have to ask her .
i promise you what happened ?
why ? it 's good to say .
oh maybe i will .
well our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive . i have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages .
bye !
yummy ! yummy ! eat more !
yes i have another room .
let 's see . have you got it ?
i buy most of my daily necessities online .
what kind of things do you want to learn ?
i want to know more about you .
that 's fine .
we have a lot of friends .
what happened ?
you need to security .
yeah i think it seems that i will be better .
i 'm late . i 'm late .
who is that ?
i just got home tonight .
i wonder what happened .
it 's a job at a recruitment agency .
oh no . anything else ?
yes it 's not . but i 've got a lot of money .
do you have training program ?
that sounds perfect .
you should take good care of it .
bye .
well nothing special reading watching tv walking and so on .
there s a good movie in it .
i only think that movie is a good movie . so what 's your favorite movie ?
i like all sorts of movies primarily drama and science fiction .
well i am not a good movie .
i do n't agree with you .
yeah they look nice .
so can i speak chinese to you ?
i usually go to see a movie with my friends .
come on son .
it 's on the 9th .
thanks . i 'll give you a credit card .
sure . it is a most popular dish .
but i ca n't find out if he 's a good hobby .
sure . i ll show you how to use it .
is it a horror movie ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
hey how would you like to taste my fist ?
alright all joking aside what kinds of moves do you like ?
um let me see romance comedy . documentary action science fiction animated and so on .
that is to say you like all <unk> except for horror movies .
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
the notebook is this type of movie .
really ? i have n't heard of it .
well then this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . i bet you 'd love it .
ok . i ca n't wait to see it . let 's go !
i had a drop too much last night . i attended a banquet given by a chinese colleague of mine . and it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a chinese table .
you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or wouldbe friends is a way of solidifying friendship especially in northern china .
i just felt embarrassed if i refused to drink when people toasted to me . but if i keep gulping down one cup after another i 'm afraid i would feel unfit or sick .
you lose face by refusing to drink and the host might think you refuse to give him face . the right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . this will endear you to your friends .
a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night crying hoarsely and <unk> whole heaps of nonsense that i never understood .
then he must be opening his heart to the friends .
i got you . next time . i 'll <unk> a toast with a statement like i ca n't drink any more and then drink anyway .
really ? where did you hear that ?
i met with the supervisor just this morning . i do n't know but i am a little worried . who do you think will get sacked ?
i 'm not sure . . . well first it could n't be george . he is such a <unk> . he 'd wash the boss 's dog if he asked .
no it 's not going to be george . i do n't think it 's andy either . he is involved with the boss 's sister inlaw . and you know how whipped our boss is .
that 's true . what about lisa ? i bet there 's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
lisa ? no way . i 've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . you know rumors ca n't come out from nowhere .
well okay . then there is still michael . but he 's the boss pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . it definitely wo n't be michael .
no that would be crazy . but then who will it be ? oh dear it must be me . i should have known it ! why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . what should i do ? i 've got a family to support .
well it could be me too . but i am not too worried . this place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hardass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . it would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place .
it 's very nice . i have n't heard live music in a while . this is fun .
well then may i invite you for the next dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
do n't worry . i 'm not much of a dancer myself .
you 're dancing so well .
you dance beautifully too .
when did you learn to dance ?
in college . but i do n't dance very often . what 's your favourite dance ?
it 's hard to say . it depends . but i love the waltz .
how about tango ?
oh i like it . it 's such a beautiful dance but i ca n't do it well . what about you ?
tango is my favorite . anything but <unk> or the foxtrot . the music has stopped
thank you for the dance .
thank you for your compliment .
hurry up will be ready in a minute .
yes it 's not like what the radio said at all .
we 're really sorry for the delay . i 'll check immediately and call you back .
i feel it 's about 5 degree celsius .
is it expensive ?
it 's going to rain .
how do i find it ?
do you have some medicine ?
really ? i thought you would be happy to hear about it .
i m going to go home .
really ? how nice !
i am free tomorrow .
how long will it take to go there ?
really ?
i was n't feeling well .
i don t like it .
the one that stole a small plane ?
he 's in the middle of something .
i could n't stand it anymore .
do you have an appointment ?
um . i 'm sorry . i had to leave the office suddenly and wo n't be able to return until next week .
it 's really good .
everyone in the office ?
wow ! good for you !
he 's kidding .
what 's the matter ?
no . i thought it was online .
you should have asked me about it .
he has a jacked or a plage shirt .
what is it ?
i didn t know anything about it .
no i thought about that . but i got the promotion .
you mean it is no problem at all .
no the one you have on looks fabulous especially with your hair like that .
i was thinking about it .
what size do you wear ?
were you ?
yes you have good luck .
i m so sorry to hear that .
sure . a ufo is just a space vehicle from another planet . if you think about it our space <unk> are ufos .
i 've never thought about it like that before .
i 've seen photos of ufos in america before but they 've all looked doctored up .
do you think that there 's life on other planets ?
i think there must be .
i think so .
because you can see the stars perfectly .
do you think that there 's intelligent life trying to contact us ?
no but we 're trying to contact them .
i suppose you 're right .
i think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet <unk> will not become extinct .
do you really think that global warming wil destroy earth some day ?
there 's a lot of evidence that suggest it will but i do n't think it 's going to happen any time soon .
you 're in luck .
really ? i m crazy about him .
yes . we ve got a great favor . what are you doing ?
what does it do ?
why don t you just ask her to play ?
let s go .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
why do n't you try doing that again ?
i love you too .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
let me see . that one goes for 17 .
would you take 12 ?
no i can t give it to you let you have it for 12 . how about 14 ?
13 . 50 ?
sorry 14 is the lowest i can go .
i know what you mean .
me too . i ll come later .
that s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city .
really ? then i guess i won t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
actually you might because there s a big convention in town this weekend .
i m not too worried about it . i always seem to find something .
let me check . oh ! it s at 325 .
wow that 's cutting it close ! that means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! what gate is it at ?
it 's at . . . gate 14 .
that 's too bad .
ok so here s the plan when we land run to gate 14 !
i 'm be right behind ya !
i 'm a clerk in a shop .
you know what this job is all about .
it s a very cool job .
me too .
i work at the polling place .
yes . you can take some .
who 's the pair for ?
may i help you with something ?
read me the index number !
my grandpa is 36 .
that s right . most of the owners will be there in a few days .
because you can see the stars perfectly .
really ? have you ever had a dog ?
to tell you the truth i wish to keep it .
it 's inevitable .
my car broke down .
you ca n't believe what ?
i was there for almost a year .
why ? does he have a change ?
no . i have n't even told you yet .
i remember now . he must be divorce .
i 'm afraid i did n't .
it s true . you just did n't buy a new one .
almost two years .
what do you think about your family ?
he wo n't be surprised .
i couldn t agree with you .
as you know china has a singlechild policy . therefore there s just my husband my daughter and i . what about in your family ?
i have a large family . i have three older sisters my twin sister a younger brother and parents .
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
we 're identical . i mean we look exactly the same but we are complete opposites when it comes to everything else .
interesting . it must be great having a twin sister . are you best friends too ?
we used to be really close but that all changed once she moved to shanghai . how about your family ? you didn t mention to your biological father .
i don t know much about him . he died when i was just a baby . even though i do n't have a blood relationship with my stepfather and stepbrother i consider them to be my real family .
what about your stepbrother 's mother ?
no she also died when my stepbrother was little . my mother and my stepfather met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . they ended up getting married a few years later .
sounds like it was meant to be .
no i did n't know that . and i had a rest on it .
i think that 's too bad .
hey chill out ! i 'm just cannot understand .
it 's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances .
he 's a bit shy .
a wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . if i had drunk enough and i would have had the bold to punch him in the face .
did n't anyone know that ?
he 's tall and strong .
i see . it 's hard to say .
he was wearing a mask .
he must be .
he 's checking bags . he s an official in the customs .
yes i was born in beijing but i spent most of my childhood in london .
let 's see . where did you live ?
i had a pretty strict upbringing and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me .
were the parents ?
no . they live alone .
i see . so what seems .
i graduated with a ba in english from qingdao university .
it sounds like you have fun .
i am a journalist . i write for china daily .
cool . thanks a lot . i have learned a lot .
no i thought about it .
i see that s not a good time .
pretty well . i ve always been worked hard for 2 years .
okay . how could you do that ?
no . i 'm impressed .
do i know anything about the men and things like that ?
my husband and i have thought about it but we ve decided not to have any . they are just too expensive . besides with all the news about global warming on the news lately who knows what kind of world we ll have in the future . what about you ?
yes that 's true . i guess there 're also a lot of things to do .
for me growing up in a big family always made me <unk> for attention . i always wanted to be an only child so that i could always do what i wanted and so that i wouldn t ever have to share .
you would n't be happier !
no i do n't think it 's boring . what do you think ?
if china didn t have such a policy can you imagine how many people there would be in china now ?
that 's true . but as a woman i would be glad that even though i don t want any children i at least have a choice in how many children i have . on the other hand i can t imagine what china would be like if there weren t a onechild policy !
i agree . but a lot of people should do now .
i don t know what other people think but i for one envy only children !
that sounds great . i 'm absolutely starving ! what kind of food are you in the mood for ?
i 'd love something spicy . maybe we could get some sichuan hotpot .
you are a woman after my own heart . i do n't know many people who can handle spicy food . are you sure you are up for hot pot ?
i guess so . i do n't have enough money to eat spicy food at home !
ok so are you doing anything this weekend ?
well let 's stop dragging our feet and find a sichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner !
let me think about it for a minute . let 's see . . . oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! give me a second and it 'll come to me .
well . . . ? have you thought of it yet ?
no . . .
never mind . there 's an authentic tasting hot pot restaurant not far from the china world trade towers on chang an street . have you been there ?
that 's it ! that s the one i was thinking of ! i told you i 'd remember it !
you really have a big head do n't you .
i m not sure but probably about 75 years . how about in your country ?
about 70 i think . this newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . it s a problem that will soon affect most of the world .
i heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .
perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
did she ? that s great . however if we have too many children that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .
she was a worker but i didn t know that .
fine . thanks .
he ll be a teenager before you know it ! teenagers are often rebellious ! when do you think it is a good age to have a child ?
i had mine when i was 24 . that s a little young . i d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .
yes i think you 're right . i m thinking about having a child but not just yet .
what 's the problem ?
yes there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out have fun and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discourage them but they don t often succeed .
parents usually give their children more freedom in my country .
it s almost impossible to get the right balance . if you are too strict kids might ignore you . if you are too lenient they might go wild .
what did you argue about ?
he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back . he said he didn t have the money yet .
well he should pay you back . it s only fair .
yes but i got angry with him too quickly . he probably thought that i <unk> him . i shouldn t have got angry .
did you lend him a lot of money ?
not much . i had to pay an unexpected bill so i needed the money back .
well talk to him about it next time you see him . he probably feels as bad about it as you do . close friends sometimes have disagreements . it s nothing unusual . neither of you said anything really nasty did you ?
no we should patch things up . i guess you re right .
of course you should . you wouldn t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship would you ?
i m not sure . i guess i d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time .
would you like to go out some time ?
that is what the poll shows .
how gross !
so i .
but it is terrible .
i saw the movie the other day .
what else do you think that most ?
yes . you know what many people like .
i just make eye contact with him and nod my head . then i tell him when he comes over to the table . why do you ask ?
i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
that seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .
that s what i thought . i just thought i d ask you and see what you thought of it . anyway what did you do yesterday evening ?
well it was a warm evening so i stretched my legs . i walked along the canal for a couple of miles . actually several other people had the same idea . i saw bill .
did you ? how is he these days ?
he seemed ok . we didn t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . we just waved at each other .
i need to move some furniture . could you help me to lift it ?
of course . what do you want to move first ?
let s move the sofa . can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? i ll lift this end . i want to move it sideways in that direction .
no not very much .
i agree . i like his brother paul .
yes . they are completely different . paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother .
what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?
i think i m polite careful relaxed and shy .
oh i do n't think you 're shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party .
well . yes but those people always start talking to me . i never talk to them first . perhaps i 'm not as shy as i think . anyway you 're certainly not shy !
you 're right . i love going out and making new friends .
so you 'll be at my birthday party on friday ?
i 'll have to ask my mother .
i wouldn t miss it for the world ! it s sure to be fun . she s invited a lot of people . do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ?
if everyone turned up it would be a squeeze but a few people said that they couldn t go so i think it should be ok ?
are you taking anything ?
i ve got her a birthday present and i ll take a bottle fo wine too .
that s a good idea . she told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . i think it s going to be a noisy party . i hope her neighbours don t mind too much .
helen gets on very well with her neighbours . i wouldn t be surprised if they went to the party too .
i m ready looking forward to it . this party is going to be a blast !
well don t be late . i ll see you on friday at helen s .
it certainly was a great party . it s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here .
i expected that something might get broken . that doesn t bother me . that spilled drink won t leave a stain will it ?
i doubt it i 'll deal with it right away . luckily it wasn t a glass of red wine i ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth .
i m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag .
afterwards we can do the washing up together . everything will be finished within an hour . your friend keith is really funny . i liked his magic tricks .
yes he s very good . . isn t he ? he told some funny stories too .
amanda told some very funny jokes . at the beginning of the party she was being very serious .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
what did you put in that punch ? it tasted great but was quite strong .
that s my little secret . did you like the snacks that i prepared ?
very much . the birthday cake was delicious wasn t it ? emily told me that she and karen made it themselves .
that cake tasted so good ! it disappeared within minutes so i think everyone liked it a lot . how s that stain ?
all cleaned up . are you ready to start on the washing up ?
well first of all it s much bigger . it has the same number of rooms but each room is larger . we also have a larger garden which our dog loves of course !
so it s a threebedrooms detached house ?
yes . one bedroom is for my wife and i . there s another for our daughter . my wife wants to use the third one as a guest room but i d like to make it into a study . our daughter is also keen on making it a study so that s probably what will happen .
what s the kitchen like ? i know both you and your wife like to cook .
that s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . the kitchen and dining room are together . it s really large .
are the rooms nice and bright ?
yes they are . that s very important to us . we like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . each room has large windows .
do you have a balcony ?
no we don t . we wish we had one . that s the only thing we wanted but don t have . the area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly .
you re right on the edge of the city aren t you ? there can t be much noise or traffic there . is it easy to get into city centre ?
it s a very quiet neighbourhood . there s some traffic but not much . it s not very difficult to get to the city centre but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ll get lost . so when are you going to drop by ?
my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . they have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . the picture are of things they want . people sign their name by the item they will buy .
that s clever ! then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there s no chance of two people buying the same gift . what things were in the notebook ?
most of the things were household appliance . you know everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . i think it s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home .
so what did you get them ?
i bought a sewing machine . i know that my friend likes making her own clothes but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems .
that sounds kind of boring . how about the color of machine ?
my daughter s just banged up her knee pretty badly and i m going to have to take her to the hospital . i ll be about two hours late .
household appliance don t seem to last for a long time nowadays .
i think it s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . because they know that we will buy the new models the appliances don t need to last more than five or ten years at most .
not really . i like looking on the internet at what s available but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i m buying before i pay for it . sometimes i ll look at something in a shop but later buy it online if it s cheaper . you don t like buying things online do you ?
ok . i m a little worried about security . you never who s trying to find out your codes and <unk> . aren t you worry about that ?
not really . i know that it happens but if you buy from <unk> companies with secure websites you should be ok . even though i use online shopping facilities i don t think it s the best way to shop .
i m surprised to hear you say that . i thought you loved anything technological .
i do . i m a big fan of using new technology but i don t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . i think people need to get out and interact with other people .
so how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
sure . i d love to join you . can we stop by the computer store ? i just want to see if they have something .
sure . while you re in the computer store . i will visit the book store opposite . i like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting .
ok . i ve finished online . let s go . i ll just get some money and my credit card .
thanks for reminding me . i had forgotten to get mine .
yeah the food and pack some food and beverages .
that 's quite convenient .
yes . it 's really wonderful here the grass is greener and the air is fresher than those in the city .

sounds good ! what is the hotel that we will be staying at like ?
that is the best part . your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to accommodate a maximum of that is guests . you will enjoy an intimate and private time in this
it sounds like .
of course ! the hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail . you can also go fishing to the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard .
i m sold ! i want to book this trip . i don t care what it costs ! money is no object !
sure sir . you can take care of yourself for the key .
wait a minute pleasemr . wong i 'm terribly sorry . our delivery truck had an accident today . i 'm afraid your sofa wo n't be delivered until tomorrow .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
ok i ll talk to you later .
i 'm here if you need any more help .
no that way is longer .
i m very happy to hear that . my problem is the house .
i do n't think we have a swimming pool sir but we do have swim stations in the gym .
no you haven t thought about it ?
well the check is included .
that s fine . we d better have a try .
no i have no complaints . i hear there was many opportunities to move up in this company . is that true ?
do you have access to the internet ?
forget about it .
i hope you don t love me .
no problem . everything is fine with you .
thanks i don t know about that .
oh that 's good .
how long is it altogether ?
it s about six or seven miles . that s about the kilometers .
that sounds ok . so we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall .
right . then we turn left and walk up this small hill . the view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . we can eat a snack there .
then we will follow this path down the hill to the old church .
we can spend a few minutes looking around the church . then we turn right and walk along this path .
this path leads to the cave . can we look inside the cave ?
yes we can but it isn t very interesting .
then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path .
right . we have no choice .
you need to print your name on this list .
i think it will take about four hours including breaks .
that s fine . are there signposts along the way in case we get lost ?
yes there are . they tell use which way to go and how far we have to walk .
yeah i 've been looking for four years .
you must prepare your resume first .
i m afraid you can t miss it .
i see .
your passport and id card .
yes . you look so nice .
i believe they must have mixed hackers with each other .
that s wonderful .
we 've heard about that before .
i 'd like to book a reservation to huston for tomorrow .
could you wait a moment please ? i ll check the room availability for you . . . yes . there s a problem .
you see we are tourists whose requests are different so please tell me more about it will you ?
excuse me . may i have your name please ?
nonsmoking .
are there any discount ?
ok . here you are .
what s your problem ?
sure . please fill out this form .
what s this question ?
apparently you have unpaid late fees .
yes i d like to check three pieces .
i m sorry sir . airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage at twenty kilograms each plus one piece of carryon luggage . i will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase .
what ? why ! i am taking an intercontinental flight ! i m flying sixteen thousand cms ! how am i supposed to only take two twenty kilo bags ? that s absurd !
i am sorry sir there s nothing i can do . you cannot board the flight with that large bag either . carry on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat . that bag is clearly too big .
now i see . you charge next to nothing for an international ticket but when it comes to charging for any other small thing you charge an arm and a leg ! so tell me miss how much will i have to pay for all of this .
let s see . . . six hundred and twentyfive us dollars .
that s more than my roundtrip ticket !
good idea . thank you very much .
're right . thank you .
yes it is . are you in a hurry sir ?
i guess it will be . i 'll miss you for the invitation .
what is it that you need to do ?
i love you too .
are you ready to leave ?
i 've got it all taken care of .
that s great to hear .
how much do are you looking to spend ?
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
how do you think of it ?
i think you re right . i don t want to see a doctor .
thanks that was a big help .
sir according to your file you spent monday evening watching titanic .
well the file is wrong .
okay . may i have your name and phone number ?
got it .
what about a problem ?
you ca n't do that ! you ca n't charge me for a mistake that you made !
here you are .
i see . i 'd like to try this hotel .
i ate too much pork yesterday .
what kind of food do you want ?
we like it very much .
that s fine . take it easy .
that sounds like a good idea .
ok let 's go .
i like that idea i ca n't wait to see it .
i 'm sorry but you will contact me .
i 'll be happy to help you .
no not at all !
well it s better to tell you the truth .
yes . but is there anything wrong with it ?
by the way please .

i can make reservations for you if you d like .

i 'd prefer the filet but the porterhouse will do .

well i prefer filet but porterhouse is good !
no i 'll tell you the champagne will be good .
thank you but i just finished eating some chocolatecovered cherries .
thank you for helping me .
of course not !
i would also like a bag of chips .
we serve different styles of mind but i 'm not sure which one do you prefer .
i 'm afraid i ca n't sit down . let me have a look .
i 'm sorry . we have no more filet mignon . may i suggest the porterhouse instead ?
well i 'd prefer filet but porterhouse is good too .
i love apple pie too .
thank you but i just finished eating some chocolatecovered cherries .
but i do n't care for it .
fine .
open your mouth and show me your tongue . say ah . . . you have a bad cold . so you must stay in bed for a week .
just plug the ethernet cable into your computer and a prompt will tell you the payment options .
that would be okay if i had an ethernet port . unfortunately my laptop uses wireless only .
why do you have a virus on your computer ?
yes i 'd love to hear about the alternatives .

to tell you the truth i 'm not an only one who can do it .

i ll remember that .
you need to drink a lot of water .

the best product is <unk> and you can buy either the lotion or cream .
sounds great . which ones do you prefer ?
i 'd like to try mexican food .
this california weather is so uncertain it 's impossible to try .
you could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker .
i appreciate it .
you 're welcome . your boarding pass and baggage check please .
no problem . please wait a minute . she goes to the back for a few minutes . here is your medicine sir . take two tablets after each meal and once before bed .
i do n't think that is it ?

we 'll give you a second thought about it .
that 's great . thank you .
not at all .
how often do you drink ?
you really have no side effects .
actually i haven t been sleeping well .

no i have n't done that .
you said it .
i brush my teeth at most .
does it bother you when you eat something really cold ?
yes . i remember it last month .
fifteen years ago ?
i appreciate it .
have you had anything to do ?
i will choose the tonic .
count me in .
actually it 's a love story .
you could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker .
i appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching .
when did you find it ?
i ve been getting really short of breath and my coach wanted to have a doctor check me out .
calm down !
i 've been having a little trouble lately .
how long ago was that ?
no i only have one left .
will that be all for you ?
i just use a regular hard bristle toothbrush .
how long does it take ?
yes it definitely bothers me more when i do that .
is that all right ?
what should i do after that ?
some of my friends tell me that being a teacher the most important is the beauty of mind . you should n't pay too much attention to your appearance . you should appear frugal and prudent . your experience and knowledge will gain the appreciation of your interviewer .
do i owe you ?
that s fine .
well i hope you can keep it .
yes . thank you .
i 'm honored to meet you .
the closest garage . what 's the charge ?
what can i do madam ?
it 's <unk> it has a brushed titanium metal body and a rubber shockproof <unk> case with a belt clip .
thanks doc . i ve got a really bad toothache ! i can t eat anything and look my face is all swollen . i think it might be my wisdom tooth .
well let s have a look . open wide . hmm . . . this doesn t look good . well it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . we ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse and the crown probably needs to be refitted . i m going to order some xrays .
is it gonna hurt ?
no not at all ! just lay back and relax .
who 's winning ?
yes the pain comes more intense when the weather is bad . and the pain comes more intense when i walk too much .
have you ever had any trauma ?
yes i hit the spot .
well you have to wait for a computer .
yes it does . just like a needle prick . besides the place that hurts often feels cold too .
is that better ?
i do n't think so .
what would you like for a drink ?
by the way does acupuncture hurt ?
acupuncture may cause just a little pain but it also causes a certain feeling of numbness and distension . we ll try it every day for seven days . will that be all right ?
yes . let 's start today .
that 's good to hear . you 've had an ideal recovery from your operation .
do you think i can get back to work very soon ?
do n't be in such a hurry . i 'm confident that you 'll be completely recovered in 4 to 6 weeks .
is there anything i should do ?
you 'd better have a good rest for a week . be sure to have regular meals . stay away from alcohol . give up smoking at least a little while .
should i take some medicine ?
yes . i 'm going to give you some . take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . for that one two tablets . and remember to come to the out patient department for a consultation in two weeks please .
take it easy .
do n't mention it . it was the least i could do .
let me see . roll up your sleeve please . um . . . it 's swollen and red here . i 'm afraid we 'll need to take an xray to see if it 's broken .
what if it 's broken ?
then we 'll put you in a cast .
ok . where is it ?
i play the piano for myself .
when did you have your eyes checked ?
two years ago . at that time i had no problems . now i can t even make out something ten meters away .
come over here . i will test your eyes . first cover your left eye like this and when i point please read the chart from the top and go as far as you can telling me which way the e points .
how should i take my test ?
the hair stylist cuts the customer 's hair . almost done . i just have to even things up a bit . she shows the customer the results . will that do ?
well this one is worse .
never mind just read as far as you can .
i can only read the first three lines .
you ought to see a doctor .
what ?
maybe we could ask you some of them .
sorry ma 'am . we will have to get it fixed .
chill out !
no thanks a lot . i 've got to go now .
not long . they 'll be ready in a few minutes .
i guess i have a little heatstroke from being a while .
i 'm afraid it 's going to rain .
but how old is your thing ?
that 's pretty bad .
no . nothing special .
what 's your problem anyway ?
nine o 'clock .
consider yourself lucky .
i 'm worrying about it .
that will be right .
really ? it 's just impossible .
we will provide you with standby letter of credit established by bank of china .
my roommate always brings a lot of friends from <unk> . they stay in the room until midnight singing and talking drinking and playing cards while i have no place for study . i even do n't have the quietness to sleep .

you 'll find it very soon .
i think a company is a place to get work done . certainly friendly open relationships among all company employees is important and i think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a professional relationship with the boss .
i think a company is a place to get work done .
i have to know more about it and civilized manner in order to get a good marks .
how about your salary ?
overtime work is very common in companies . i can work overtime if it 's necessary but i don t mind working overtime everyday .
that 's good .
i think the most important thing is the nature of the job . one should never do anything one is not interested in .
this title does not only give you a raising paycheck but also increase responsibilities .
i would n't call myself extroverted . sometimes i enjoy being by myself very much . but other times i like sharing activities with others too especially during these last few years .
do you have another question ?
i think i m a grownup .
never mind . i just do n't understand him .
well i m very good with people . i m honorable . i work hard . i work well under pressure . and i m patient .
do you like your present work ?
i m afraid i m a poor talker . i m not comfortable talking with the people whom i have just met for the first time . that is not very good for business so i have been studying public speaking .
oh it is my cell phone ringing . i set it in the vibration mode .
it is a good habit to set your cell phone to <unk> . it is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices .
you are right . some ring tone is just terribly loud . you can hear it even in the next door . it is really a kind of distraction .
maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done .
how can i help you ?
of course you can . i am sure this one works very well . i just sent dozens of pages . how many pages are you sending ? are you familiar with my fax machine ?
yes i think you have the same model as i have . does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
yes it will print immediately .
it seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
do you know how to do it ? i am not so good at machine things . i will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
check with somebody from the it department . they are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
we have thought of you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience .
experience is indeed very important but don t you think capability is more important than it ?
of course i do . but not .
maybe you could hire me on trial if i m not qualified for this position you can let me go .
thanks that 's very kind of you .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
i believe it is ok .
what made you think are the best ?

no problem . thank you .
you can send your email address to the websites of job agencies for <unk> in their database .
that s great . could you tell me more about your educational background ?
you can put that on the scale .

yes that 's why they give you a call .
cheer up !

you can say your english is good enough .
i 'll be glad to help you .
no thanks . i 'd like to help you .
sounds good to me .
are you kidding me ?
i think i can take care of it .
i 'm glad to be able to help .
what 's the criteria like now ?
i think we can solve the problem immediately .
as the saying goes we have competitors from south korea and other countries . at the beginning of our campaign there is sales resistance to overcome we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and tv programs . a 20 commission will not leave us much .
i want to tell them about that .
once i contact the owners and confirm the times i will email you a schedule .
as a rule we do n't allow any commission . however as an encouragement for businesses we will allow you a 3 commission .
the european market is not familiar with your products . you have competitors from japan and other continental countries . at the beginning of our campaign there is sales resistance to overcome we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news papers and tv programs . a 10 commission will not leave us much .
what else is that ?
i 'll tell you what i usually do .
i yep . that way i can satisfy my craving for spicy food and you can eat hot pot without burning into flames .
by the way do you mind having a commission of ten percent ?
i see . and how much ?
thanks a lot . please sit down .
it 's been nice talking about you .
i am very satisfied with you in future .
i am glad you could say so .
i wish i could .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
yes i have passed but i will cook it .
if you miss this class you will have used up your quota for the semester .
what i think that it 's going to rain .
well let 's go over there .
that s fine . is there anything else i can do for you mrs . <unk> ?
i ll see . thank you for coming .
what else can you say ?
i was just thinking about someone i went to school with this boy i was quite friendly with in third grade . we used to hang out together he lived next door but then my parents moved and i changed schools and never saw him again .
i could go for that .
i am afraid not .
our goods are wellexamined before shipment . i 'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route .
quite right . follow me .
that 's excellent . thank you very much .
where can i find it ?
let me see . laptop flash disk a ballpoint pen a pencil a notebook a pair of glasses cell phone charger moisture notion . . . oh that is too much . you are not going to a business trip .

what qualities would you expect of persons working as a team ?
my children can never be obedient even if i criticized them severely .
cheer up ! it 's not the only thing you do n't need to worry about .
certainly . i 've got a terrible headache .
you do n't need to worry about it .
i 'm sorry for that .
of course it 's been a pleasure .
in my heart i think that 's why .
which one interests you sir ?
i ca n't believe it .
can you slow down ?
that sounds interesting .
i 'll tell him .
when can you tell me how to write the lessons ?
you should keep proper posture for yourself .
i 'm sure i 'll have taken all of it .
i m not good at speaking in public . i feel uncomfortable when i speak in public .
why not ?
i have taken some courses in college such as translation business english and so on . so i have a good mastery of both spoken and written english
well i love it . the room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . there are plants along the corridor . especially i got my own desk with computer and telephone . such a great place !
that s very good . i once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
what was so bad about it ?
small rooms small window a small desk shared by three people . i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
sounds bad ! lucky you ! you didn t take that job . i think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
totally agree . by the way the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . you can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .

sure i can .
that 's a good idea .
unfortunately i 'm leaving here unexpectedly and i may be away for several days .
it 's not available for me .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
yes i am sorry . i missed the bus .
but there 's a bus every ten minutes and you are over 1 hour late .
well i missed several buses .
how on earth can you miss several buses ?
i ah . . . i got have late .
oh come on gordon it 's the afternoon now . why were you late really ?
well i . . . i lost my wallet and i . . .
have you got it now ?
yes i found it again .
is it a twopin socket ?
at 10 o 'clock .
i am not convinced by your explanation .
this is brown speaking . i 'd like to speak to mr . tomas .
sorry i did n't hear you . could you say that please ?
i do n't understand .
i 'm afraid not . he is away for the rest of the day .
is there any other way i can reach him ?
i 'm afraid not he has gone out of this town . may i take a message ?
yes but i have a business appointment with him .
would you like to make another appointment ?
unfortunately i 'm leaving here unexpectedly and i may be away for several days .
i see . i 'll tell mr . tomas you 've called .
when do you want to come in please ?
i 've noticed from your resume that you majored in accounting at peking university . will you please tell me something about your related courses ?
well i 'm glad i did n't know .
tell me something about that .
yes i should .
yes what kind of individual do you usually do ?
i see . let 's go .
i have a fever .
thank you for your advice .
do n't be silly .
if you are such a good learner you must have made up my mind .
have you booked already ?
but i do n't know how to do that .
do you want to learn a lot ?
let 's see . . .
what 's your problem ?
i wo n't .
but the sales number is close to the predicted amount .
can i use the computer ?
cheer up !
if so we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks .
what i mean is that we 'll never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great .
i think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . how about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ?
what is the problem ?
i think to get the business done you should at least reduce the price by 20 .
well what do you suggest then ?
i think that 's the best way to go for a further reduction .
the best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . that 'll definitely be rock bottom .
ok i 'm next monday .
all right . we accept it . so what price would you suggest ?
of course !
i ought to make the most of it while i 'm here do n't you think ?
i see .
what 's the price ?
it 's the best price i can do .
ok . i 'll accept it this afternoon .
i think that 's a good idea .
that 's ok . but i always have the feeling that i feel better .
what can we have ?
are you kidding ?
i hope to solve the problem of them .
sure ! how much do you like this one ?
i 'm glad to hear that .
i see .
how much is the cost ?
i worked in a bank for several years .
well we 've just got some here .
well let me see . have you got an idea of what you want ?
to consider it a trial order .
how much money should we go ?
really ? i 'm looking forward to it .
she was fairly good .
what happened to him ?
i m sure you ll agree with him .
that 's exactly what i think .
well it is not going to be worth it .
you know very much about it .
when is it expensive ?
we should be able to do that .
it will be my pleasure to hear that .
no that 's too bad .
who made it from ?
very good .
i am so happy to be of assistance .
have you thought about it ?
yes i have been thinking about it for quite a while . now i finally make up my mind to leave . i have given my resignation letter to our boss last friday .
ok did you find a new company ?
yes i will move on to xyz company .
good for you but your leaving will be a great loss to us . it is so nice to work with you .
thanks . i had learned so much from you and our colleagues .
i think the most important thing is the nature of the job .
do you think about that idea ?
i 'm sorry sir . i do n't think the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
well i am not sure . lets me check my agenda
great let 's go ahead and get something to eat .
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
it is ok with me . so i will be arriving at your office around two fifteen pm .
i 'd like to see that .
that would be great .
i asked for a nonsmoking room and i do n't have one . my room smells like cigarette smoke . i ca n't stand it . could you change my room please ?
it is ok . you look really pale and red eyes . i suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest .
thank you very much . i am sure good rest will do indeed . i don t have this too often .
well it is hard to say . at least you need to come up with a good reason .
actually it is my mother s wedding . my parents divorced many years ago . now she is ready to establish a new family . it is a special occasion . i ve got to be there right ?
yes you should be there . go find the manager and ask . i think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . don t forget to fill in the leave application form . it will be signed by the manager for approval .
ok i ll try .
yes i understand . but i 'm busy .
i always love you .
maybe . we do n't like it either .
i 'm sorry .
i want to work in a restaurant .
perhaps you are a quick learner .
hello . i 'd like to make a call to australia .
ha i am flattered . actually when it comes to negotiate you don t need to like it . you just need to understand how it works .
i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice .
well generally speaking if you want to change someone s mind or understand his position you have to put yourself in his shoes . understand his need and the cost for his need . and then you work together to find a solution .
sounds easy . but how can i apply to practice ? i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . but i am afraid our boss will turn me down .
ok as john after kennedy put it let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate .
that is very encouraging news . i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . that is to say the r d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
it is not an easy job . how do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
that is the best one i have seen . i am sure our target customers young people will love it .
i do n't know the haunted house .
oh you are so efficient . i thought you might give it to me tomorrow . thanks .
you re welcome . you know these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . the more i think about it the more i hate myself for being so disorganized . i decided to change the situation as soon as possible . otherwise i will be more regretful later .
this is encouraging news good for you ! what is your solution then ?
the most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
sounds not bad ! better performance isn t just about doing a lot more . it is about focusing on the right things to do .
can you tell me something about your background ?
have you been there for a long time ?
of course . we have plenty of time .
i am glad to get that .
we can discuss them detailedly over the meeting and choose the best way to promote our key products .
what happens to me ?
thank you very much . i have got the flu .
thank you . i appreciate your help .
i bought you some books on literature i do n't know if you would like them .
i like to be paid more than that . hopefully 120000 yuan per year .
i do n't know anything about the post machine . it comes with the securities company .
yes .
ok . do you want to pay for it ?
we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
yes we do .
no . but the contract stipulates that i will teach 22 hours a week . will you have <unk> classes for me right away ?
certainly . when do you plan to leave ?
so i am sure everything will be settled .
our monthly salary is sixtyfive thousand dollars per year .
that 's nice but i 'd like to find a cheaper one .
great ! would you like a smoking or nonsmoking room ?
all right . i see .
unfortunately they do n't .
what 's that ?
but you have to pay the fee for refund .
why not ?
ok it 's a date then !
do you want it delivered ?
we usually do that for you .
your flight takes off at 8
i can do that for you right now .
i 'm not busy at all .
of course if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank or open new accounts with you .
well thank you .
what s an question ?
professor donald are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ?
really ? do you think i can make a reservation ?
what would you like for a drink ?
that sounds great .
certainly . do you want to talk about him ?
i appreciate what you know is something about this position .
i m not quite sure .
good luck !
i could n't agree more .
yes i m <unk> about your advertisement for a sales manager in today s newspaper . is this position still open ?
yes but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?
yes i have a lot of previous experiences in sales . i worked in sales departments for two companies since i finished my university .
that sounds fine . please give me your name and phone numbers . i ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . it will most likely be in a couple of days . is it all right for you ?
yes my name is brian and my phone number is 5294870 .
thank you very much .
your major must be computer .
do you think my educational background suits this position ?
yes i m quite satisfied with your qualifications .
does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ?
generally speaking training new members is usually necessary . we offer our new employees a oneweek training course .
could you tell something about the job ?
yes of course . you will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints .
oh i see . i believe i can do the job well .
ok . i should have it finished by friday afternoon . then i can check those account over the weekend . we need to have them finished by monday right ?
that s right . we ll finish them just in time . the macy project can wait for the time being . we need to spend several days on that project but it isn t due to be finished until the end of the month s
from next week on we should be in less of a rush .
i m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . everyone deserves it .
don t say that yet . a new project could suddenly appear .
that s true . right . i m going back to the meeting . it s been going on for hours and there s no indication that it ll end soon .
carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is uptodate with their work .
good . i have to go right now . i really hope this meeting doesn t last too long .
they usually go on for ages .
i ll stop by if i have time later . make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines .
i will . enjoy your meeting !
not at all . go ahead .
what s this sir ?
not really so long as you follow all the regulations .
if you make mistakes in your job you 'll be fired . is that right ?
no . everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . the most important thing is to be responsible for your work .
working here involves a busy schedule and overtime . is that true ?
yes . that s true . we are always busy . the company attaches great importance to high efficiency . sometimes we have to work overtime but not always . and we have extra pay for extra work .
it seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as i expected . thank you for your help .
i am not sure .
sure that s a good idea . anything else ?
i think that we can handle everything .
that 's what i want .
i heard that a lot of places did n't import ?
how long will it take ?
but you have a test right now .
you should .
i see .
it 's 1 of them .
that 's true .
that s really expensive .
yes but have you made an appointment ahead ?
yes of course . i am monica . i have made an appointment with your hr manager .
just a minute please . i ll make a call to the hr office .
ok . how about the meeting ?
how much is it for my hair ?
you mean the network connection ?
yes i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . it took me almost one minute to open it . then there is no response for any click .
i have the same question . i can t send out mails . we d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately .
so you have to open all the envelopes .
are you kidding ?
oh i had a great time .
i did n't think about that .
let 's see . . . you are importing fifty containers of textiles from china . they should be able to place your order before the end of next week . it will take 2 days for shipping to the shipping .
fine . we will handle domestic shipping but what about customs ? will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? i hope we do n't run into any problems with the border control .
no the chinese company has that all worked out . with the paperwork you receive with the shipment you should be good to go .
where will the seller be ?
all right . i 'll get the contract .
it sounds good to me . i have a chance .
i just want to think about that .
i 'll get together and have a look .
it seems that a good idea to me .
i do n't think so .
are there many problems there ?
it 's a waste of money .
you are smart .
the price of cpu is 260 dollars . you need a deal .
i suppose you 're right .
i am not sure .
yes i didn t think about it . thank you for all the best .
take it easy . we can go along with you .
what kind of room do we have ?
no thanks . how about you ?
how much is the room ?
nothing else .
i see .
i did n't know that . alright .
because i could n't think of that .
what 's the score ?
i did n't know that .
is the long run ?
that 's right . i know americans love it .
what about your name ?
fine . let 's see .
oh that 's easy .
that 's fine ! congratulations !
i know . i ca n't help it .
that 's right . would you like to be a millionaire or something ?
i think the job should make use of the professional experience i have obtained and offer me opportunity for advancement .
why do you think you might like to work for our company ?
i feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and i am very interested . what s more your company is outstanding in this field .

really ? i ca n't help them . i know how to use it .
what is their reason for this meeting ?
what would you like for a drink ?
well that depends on what you are talking about .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . they think that is must be poor quality if it s that cheap .
what you mean .
maybe they will .
good . i am going to miss the zoo .
that 's true . do n't worry about it .
i think most people believe that teenagers have personalities from their parents .

a vegan . i do n't eat or use any animal based products . i do n't know what to do .
it s raining .
i think i did .
you 're kidding !

but let me ask the old woman in that reception office .

it s a program about islam . it s very interesting .
wow ! so many people !
they are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . muslims call this pilgrimage haj .
why do they go there ?
muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .
when muslims pray they face towards mecca .
that s right . unfortunately so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .
i heard about that . the pilgrims must walk around a large sacred black stone .
that s right . that s when accidents often happen . the saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims to reduce the chances of accidents .
pilgrimages are common in many <unk> .
yes . in england christian pilgrims might go to canterbury and many christians go to the <unk> on pilgrimages .
isn t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?
i think that place is <unk> . there are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .

hello yes i hope so .
well you can withdraw some money from your current account .

your bill will put you in the slot or the card .
it 's simple . here is my card .
thanks . how much do you pay ?
can i get the bill ?
yes . here 's the money .
okay . i 'll buy the rate for the machine .
hello ! i was exhausted some studying so i decided to read the newspaper to relax . unfortunately the news is so depressing . there has been another murder in the city center . i m shocked that the police haven t caught the killer yet .
people are starting to get frightened by it . everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .
you mean if they catch the murderer . i m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .
there must have been some good news in the newspaper . i can t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .
well there was one good piece of news . you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?
yes . her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
well they ve got the money and she s going tomorrow for treatment .
i m so happy for the family ! they must be very relieved and excited about that .
i m sure they are . oh and a local man won the lottery . i m so jealous ! i wish it were me ! i buy a lottery ticket every week and i m amazed that i haven t even won a small prize yet . it s so unfair !
don t be moody ! i hope you re not tired because we ve been invited to a party this evening . i know how excited you get about parties .
we have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . most people call them mp s .
each mp belongs to a political party right ?
almost all of them do . a few are independent . that means that they do not belong to a party . if one party more than half of the mp s . they form a government . that means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members .
why not ?
this is a small group of peopleperhaps 25 mp s who are usually <unk> . they make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
can any mp make a law ?
any mp can present a law to parliament . the proposed law is debated and voted on . if it is accepted it becomes law .
i suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
yes it does because they have most of the mp s . most mp s vote the way their party wants them to .
how do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
they produce manifesto . these documents which states their policies . some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters .
hi ! this is jill . how come you did n't come in today ?
