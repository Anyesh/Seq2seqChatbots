do n't worry about it . where did you buy a new bicycle ?

it 's a little bit expensive .
the best we can do is to lower the price by 5 percent .
ca n't you make it seven weeks for the prints ?
i m afraid not .
thank you very much .
a stop !
yes . you need to pick up a lot of pressure from the office .
i am sorry . we can not do the dishes until the match .
you want to make it ?
left the next junction . ok . that s clear .
i 'll only go to the supermarket and ask them to put it in the kitchen .
yes but i m not sure .
do you need a transfer from that stop ?
no problem . would you like some artificial carnations ?
oh no . carnations are not very elegant . artificial flowers have no passion .

money is no object .
our most elegant flower is golden lily .

the desk is away from traffic noise .

i see . did you go to the cinema school or in the evenings ?
i 'm going to work in a publishing house .
i have some friends that i need to take .
i never go to places near the office .
what do you mostly do during your workout ?
i sometimes run through a week .
in that case you want to work with less weight . you can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . five kilo weights should be enough . now it s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .
about three times a week if i can .
i would like to cancel one of my accounts .
ok please fill in the form . how about this one ? it is quite fashionable and the perfume you want .
no thank you .

yes of course . the customer is a little different . well it 's not quite my fault .
do n't you think they have a little <unk> in the back ? our dog has a few scratches on her face .
well i have had a question with what we wanted and our local news say about ! according to the bill of exchange rate we have just arrived from the five years ago . it 's actually quite possible for us to double that the ma 'am has happened the right to a bill .

we need to get it fixed soon .

no this is the second time .

just the price of these things . the price is high .
oh ? what about saturday ?

yes . do you have any specials today ?
i 'll have them sent back to our office . do you think this one will be possible ?
right now you are quite interested in the job .
about a million dollars perhaps .

good evening . my wife and i would like a room please . is there any room available ? we do n't have a reservation .
ok . please arrive at seven fortyfive . we 're expecting you at seven fortyfive . we 're waiting for two days . is that correct ?
you mean you haven t arranged any car ?

let 's go check out the kitchen next .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
that is a good idea to make sure that we are together .
i do but it saves you a lot of time . you should have bought the new car .
yes i do . i am a student here .
where is it ?
how long until you contact the sellers with the house ?
where is that ? do you want to buy a new apartment ?
it would probably be very expensive .
where is that ?
it 's the basement of an emergency room .
because the hottest season is summer in a year .
where is that ?
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
i have n't seen that much of a movie yet . maybe we can try some other time .
sure . i will bring my textbook and a tape recorder . i would like to record some things so i can practice on my own .

how about your experience ?
i see . here 's my passport .
6 . 50 .
i see .
yes . it s on the fifth floor .
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it 's about a tenminute walk .
thank you very much .
you 're welcome .
please take me to this address .
i want to ask the apartment to rent .
good evening ! do you have any rooms available tomorrow night ?
it 's about two hours .
thanks .

thank you . i will take it .
yes what do you want ?
what do you recommend ?
sure .
that 's great ! do you want me to bring us some fried noodles and four glasses ?
in the beginning of the interview it is best that you are in love with the interviewer .
when did you start teaching your parents ?
i know that 's the problem . he ca n't find any customers . it 's a pity really because his products are very good .
maybe you are right .
here you are . it comes to 84 .
where are you from ?
yes we do . here you are .
i 'll have a double whiskey on the rocks .
here are a variety of red wines for you to choose .
all right we 'll take some wine .
thank you very much .
what street do i go to to to catch it ?
you need to get off on the corner of del mar and hill .
thank you . so much for your help .
by the way i always find the shadow of death in the water . i think it 's going to be a good idea to save the distance from my parents .
i 'll be honest with you .

250 yuan but i 'm not sure it 's going to be 25 .
i think that 's too expensive . it 's worth seeing . can you give me a special discount ?
if you think it 's expensive . you can look at this one .
why do you think that this would be a good move ?
certainly . do you like the advertisement for a single room ?
have you decided what wine you would like ?
i want to see the menu .
how do i pay for the wine ?
i like it very much .
this one is a circuit board .
that s right . i did not eat any supper .
i decided to go to the gym but i 'm too tired .
yes . i bought it last week . it was the design and the design team .
i 'll take a dozen .
you know i 'm about to graduate and i need to look for a second job as soon as i finish my work .

that s right .
do n't mention it . your total is 36 . 00 .

i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
the first thing i took is the second bus but i had a great time .

yes but the telephone number is closed .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i would like to return this book .

how many nights a week is it ?
it 's 325 a month . it 's the biggest we 've got in this area .
why do n't you send it by mail payment order ?
no problem . we offer 5 kinds of dress clothing and men's jackets .
the first thing i took is the second bus but i had a great time .

not bad . actually it makes me look younger .
oh this kind of dress is becoming popular .
i 'm not very particular about the design . but i 'm not sure which one i should wear .

just tell me if she 's got the right amount . i 'll go with this and get the bottom bunk . what can i do ?
well this is just a short distance from my friend . thanks for calling . and there 's no reason they 're telling me about this . she 's just a friend and now she 'll be fine .
what if i m not in the mood for some kind of casual style ?
do you have any more information ?
i think it s fairly good .
well i suppose it 's their way to avoid such a bad habit .
sounds good . okay let me get it for you .
well in that case i think it s not too expensive .
yes .
are you ready to transfer tomorrow ?
silly me .
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
sounds interesting .

that s not a problem . i have a meeting with the boss before .

i promise i will .
of course . go straight ahead then turn left at the next intersection and you 'll see it on your left .
is there a chinese restaurant ?
it 'll take about 20 minutes .
how far is it ?
you 're welcome .
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
that d be great but could i have a cup of tea first ?
sure i ll just go put the kettle on . why don t you have a seat on the sofa and i ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .

that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that might be going overboard a bit . how about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing .
that s even better than the real thing .
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than 100 you get a 50 voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !

do you think the biggest worry about food ?
how long does it take you to cook meat on a barbecue ?
i 'm not sure . there 's one thing in particular . something else please do n't seem to have a seat over there .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
um this steak i asked for to be medium rare .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
she 's in a meeting now .
is she pretty ?
what did you do ?
and do n't worry about that . you 've got to get out of the phone .
one moment . do you want to withdraw some cash while you 're at it ?

about 12 .
that 's fine . i 'd like to go now . the train leaves on is round the corner .
yeah i think so .
no . not anymore . the jacket is all yours .
thank you for your instruction . i really do n't know the rules .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
oh . i see .
there 's quite a long list actually ! you can use if for business trip expenses medical expenses any internal payments .
that sounds like a good idea . what do you want to do ?
would you like to have a look at the menu ?
i 'm glad to hear that sir . she has to be able to help us with our clients .
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's about a tenminute walk .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
all right .
hello this is smith from 1308 can you add something to my room ?

let me see . then i am free .
it 's my fault . so what can we do now ?
ca n't you give me a warning ?
where will the new apartment be ?
i like the apartment on the fourth floor . i think it s time to catch the 12th and replace it .
it seems so small . do you have any other rooms ?
you see .
it will cost you 10 .
could you take it home ?
how much is it ?
well that s the quickest way to make a decision .
of course . we are responsible for your service .
it was n't too bad . at lease i 'm alive .
look i can t stop ! i need to get to the gym .

my name is sam . what do you think of it ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . .
me ? i 'm in the car business .
yes of course . i 've been here for nearly two years . i think the color itself is fine though .
no . the only thing i do now is i 'm fond of the job .
i did n't think it was that loud . and i told you i 'd clean it up .
no . the first break i 'm sure we 'll be all right . and i want to go back to see them .
oh i just ca n't help it . you know it was a touching movie .
yes i have been here for three years .
no i don t . i go on a winter holiday instead . i go somewhere warm .

what are the other members of your family ?
do n't forget to call me again . it 's important to have a good time .
thanks for the advice . i 'll listen to the music then .
i m looking for a bookcase but i don t want to buy a new one .
are you having any luck ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few rummage sales on saturday . i think i ll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate 9 from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at kimble s department store .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at <unk> s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .
oh my gosh ! i 'm just kidding !
yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen s boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
well a good idea . you 're a little too lucky actually .
well a good idea .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but it wouldn t be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size .
it would be hard for just me to change it . i mean we can give you the same exchange rate . we do n't have any laundry today .
no it 's not so long . you have to pay attention .
how do i get to the beach ?
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you you you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .
what a good idea !
what kind shall we get ?
we could go to more places this time if you liked .
yes fine .
when shall we go and look ?
why not sometime next week ?
no let 's go on saturday .
ok .

do n't <unk> to come straight home after school .
you 're really hot . let me get you some tylenol to bring the fever down .

it 's a deal . you can ask her out if you want to buy some things .
so how do these gifts get them ?
true enough i 've done what you think .
i think he had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked .
it does n't matter . they will make a lot of improvement in the beginning .
sorry i did n't quite catch the football isn t working .

i thought you would be able to save some money in a couple of days .
i know sweetie . just open wide . do n't talk .
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
i 'll show you how . . your face has a crush on you .
what are you talking about ? what happened ?
have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
there 's nothing that i think i should be able to sleep on . besides i do n't have a lot of english studying .
you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
you 're welcome . i hope you can find something you like .
how about oil or spray ?
sure . what is your specialty ?
what time would you like to take the test ?
how does it say ?
so you want to send it by air ?
your flight takes off at 8
can you please tell me what time you will be there ?
i 'm sorry . thank you for your help .
i would n't be able to give you the lowest price in the future .
is that it ?
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
i 've never had a mango .
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
we will need change our clothes just in case .
mangoes ? what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .

it 's a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep 's liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
the exam is not as simple as you can just imagine . i 'm just kidding .
that s stupid question . if you keep an eye on your deal then you re going to have to accept this deal with your credit limit .

i would n't mind having a talk .
sorry but he 's busy then too .
the officer says that i ran a red light but i did n't mean it .
i guess we should take some bus .

i think that he was on the sidewalk . he got it .
maybe that s a good idea .
yes and why do n't you think of the traffic ?

that s why i am interested in it .
do you know where the local office is ?
ok . i 'll send it by myself .
when would you like to be there ?

wangfujing please !
what about the international one ?
i have to be there before <unk> .
yes of course .
that 's very kind of you to say so .
i 'll do my best .

oh right . thank you .
but you 'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight wo n't you ?
100 rib .
here is ten yuan .
on a hill to the east of the tarsus river . you have a good view of the beautiful sunrise and sunset . you ca n't find a better home to live in .
will you call the taxi stand ?
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
do you have an appointment with me ?
thank you .
hi . it s tony calling from the dentist s office . is lily there ?
yeah speaking .
thank you . where should i send your final phone bill ?
i 'm afraid not . i 've just come back from see you a doctor .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
okay . well i 'll be in a minute .
see you then .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello john !
wow your apartment is a mess . what s up ?
i went up on my return office .
i 'm fine thanks .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
well ! it 's really exciting !
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
oh good . if you do n't mind if i can .
what time do i need to make an appointment for ?
do n't you hit it off ?
2 years .
i think we should take a few weeks to get together and enjoy being done .
i had a terrific working relationship with my boss . she told me the truth that i 'm a bit worried about my work .
what does she look like ?
oh no . i thought you were going to be a heavy smoker .
hmm . . . i heard he was also a politician . com .
what happened ? are you going to see him again ?
for how many people ?
hmm . i can make it . i 'm free next week .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
no you do n't have to worry about it ! just take a little extra time .
what are you doing when i do pushups ?
yeah ! it s been a long time ! it s stopped .
what 's the fire under the tree ?
ok ! i ve always wanted to watch our game before !
well i guess i 'm just gonna get it out of my paper .
we 'll go out for dinner and watch the football .
there is no other way . i can t believe that !
i m looking for a sweater .
have you brought your camera ?
i would prefer that taken care of . i just want a flash in the pan .
what s the matter ?
actually i haven t had a few surely to choose . if you want a less expensive one can save 90 minutes .
do you have a smaller one ?
thank you .
so you re pretty interested in <unk> then ?
thanks a lot . my wife has been breathing down the ground and we ve got a cold too . did you go for a while ?
i d suggest that you buy two copies of each set .
is it light ? what does it look like ?
that would be a lot of people who can watch ally mcneal .
what 's the special about this job ?
sorry miss . i do n't think so . but i 'll just be able to get out of this skirt .
hold on a second please . i ll take it back to the department .
that s right sir .
thanks for helping me .
have a great time !
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no chicken breasts .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
is this salami and bologna you have here ?
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll speak to bob he 'll be able to help us .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hello i would like a room please .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes . i 'm afraid i was out of the office .
no way ! i m gonna cut down all the way . then we can t use any problems .
can you tell me something about this ? we ve been working in this field for years and you know how to use it .
well i have to say that this song is really beautiful . i will show it to you in the kitchen .
so it s good to hear from you .
it would be a little more expensive sir .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
what size are you ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's a big garden . it might be good .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s a great idea to have a lot of restaurants and plants .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
we could get some new furniture . better stuff .
i have n't thought of that .
it 's absolutely gorgeous .
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
the rent is 1500 per month .
that s way too much .
you re not going to be able to make these items .
your life is making us healthier .
let me see . that 's three dollars ok .
that s fine .
would you please reconsider ?
i think a chinese student <unk> on written english and uses it as a basis for communicating . from start to finish he s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . this is a very difficult way to learn .
i ll be very busy at this time .
i love it . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . it gives me a real sense of satisfaction . do you enjoy cooking ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
i never buy namebrand items . i never bought it for personally . i always get clothes to make dishes from the supermarket .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
do you want your measurements ?
your latest suits me . what price did you have in mind ?
the color is all right . i am also going to take the look at the accord . it 's made of a skirt blouse .
you have made a good choice in the large quantity . would you like to try this one ?
you ll find it now .
well i think you re absolutely right . thank you for the wonderful dance .
don t worry . i ll take this one . these clothes are very expensive .
they 're fine . can i have a black one over there ?
how do you want to pay for the camera ?
well the bigger one .
even if you re interested in it you might be a good person .
you re welcome .
you 're speaking with . how can i help you ?
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i believe that this apartment would be better for me .
i can help you find the perfect place for you .
good . i will see you then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
there 's no doubt what you mean . i think i 'll get the taxi just by the door .
right . if you 're staying at our hotel you 'll have to show it to the hotel .
should i bring anything with me ?
no but if you need to check your driver 's license it 'll be too late .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
but the price has been reduced by 50 . it s a real bargain .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it 's fully furnished .
ok let s go !
i think i m going to look at the problem .
with so few windows how can you even see what the problems are ?
well i think our dark clouds is in the sky . please follow me .
let s look at it .
the best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom .
i do n't think the quality will begin with .
four . besides live together and me .
great ! where is it ?
don t worry . that will help us getting there .
what s wrong ?
no problem .
it 's a perfect fit for a put . well it 's made of wool and good paint .
my wife ! the garden looks so comfortable . what a pity i have to wear ?
i thought it might rain .
thank you .
that s what i m looking for .
i 'm sorry . he 's in the middle of the apartment . could i take a message ?
i am calling to see if you are free tomorrow . are you free tomorrow ?
oh where do you want to go then ?
you bet . i do n't think that would be possible .
i will pick you up at eight o 'clock .
i have no problem with 6 p . m .
we could use the master card .
i 'll see you then .
we have a very pleasant stay here .
should i make an appointment with me ?
no but if you like to do so i can bring some foldup chairs for people if you like . i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
yes . i 'd like to borrow these books .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
so you have a question .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
oh i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
do you know what your working experience is ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
i 'm going to get a look at it .
no i can do it in the original .
oh it 's really popular these days .
no problem . i think it 's a little tight in the waist .
what style do you want ?
i hope so . i 'm not sure about this for a long time .
in that case i 'll ask you to bring a letter of recommendation for you .
no . you can cut back on your arm to 12 .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
to the right .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
no that 's it . i mean if you 're hungry then you can buy something for a few things .
oh i see . you have a lot of experience in this .
i think that 's a tip of me .
it 's smashed in .
oh that 's a deal . thanks a lot .
yes . we have an excellent service here .
the compact and the other one is a little too heavy for me . how about the one ?
all right sir . i 'll make sure to show you the correct one .
let 's see .
oh yes i know that 's the decision of getting a parttime job is very low .
so what have you been up to ?
ok . i ll help you with the food and we can check out the kitchen next .
i am going to need to know what the advantages rate is .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
that is a good idea to make sure that we are together .
i do but it saves you a lot of time . you should have bought the new car .
yes i do . i am a student here .

where is that ?
it 's the basement of an emergency room .
because the hottest season is summer in a year .

the price of cpu is 260 dollars .

short time ? what else do you see ?
the current affairs are fashionable clothes and colors .

yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
but i want to get some money from which i want to buy .
i do n't think i can ask you if you do n't mind .
now let 's go to a local shop .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
yes i am looking for the ones in the middle of the classifieds . how much is the art art gallery ?

i 'd like to go down to new york .
are you kidding ? can you get a discount on credit card ?
my brother has last month .
excuse me but i think you must have thought of it .
i 'm afraid i ca n't help you on that . we are always willing to pay our imports for you . it is the reason that you would like to pay more attention to our customers .
that 's nice . i can make sure they do n't accept your appointment .
i 'm glad to help you sir . you 'd better use a credit card .
here you are .
thank you sir . could you sign the voucher here please ?
well . we 'll be in a really good shape . i 'd rather have to pay cash .
here 's the application form .
sure what do you want to know ?
i am disappointed with your work lately .
do i have any other choices ?
is it a long time to get there ?
anything else ?
have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?
i do n't know . but china would n't stand on the menu . they are fish all working and sudden ring tone in the fish .
yeah i know . but i would be some careful .
you can put it on the spot . now don t turn it on !
the chicken and butter ! oh ! it tastes like a great plan !
how about the jeans ?
it 's not just for the past few months . i want to try something exciting .
no i did n't think about it . but now it 's a good thing for them to do them .
i am afraid we do n't need any help to do that .
i like it very much . i ca n't bear to look at it .
that 's not exactly a compliment ! that 's one thing i have no idea . what 's it about ?
i go to panda express for my chinese food .
yeah i ll start drinking and having a cup of coffee . i ll start to work alone !
save it . every day i work hard on food every day . and i needed some extra hours of the day .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music .
mainly plastics . plastics aren t <unk> degradable they don t break down easily in the environment so they should n't be thrown away .
we have many choices of chinese dishes that are high in fat and delicious not only for dessert . what about some green salad ?
yes most of the time we eat when there is something wrong with it .
yeah . let 's get a beer and wine shall be good !
i 've never been spicy food .
yeah . i ve always been indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i was thinking about making curries now but i still need some more practice at making thai food .
my absolutely favorite kind of pie is apple .
oh look at the thermometer ! my temperature is 7 o 'clock .
first of all you need to do is make sure that you do n't spend too much time on your calendar .
it 's not as bad as you think .

i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not . do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
yes . i have to go to the movies .
i do n't have any idea what to cook .
your food tastes so much better than mine .
oh i do n't know what to make .
do you want me to make anything ?
i was thinking of pizza .
that sounds nice .
okay i 'll grill some corn then .

i get you a soda .
how about a glass of juice ?
maybe i should just have a glass of wine .
what 's playing at the century fox ?
how long does it take to get to the beach ?
yes i 'd like some coffee .
and you 're going to dust every piece of furniture in the house !
a bottle of champagne .
where 'd you like to get a drink ?
yes but it could be done .

please ask her to call john for his call .
no i think your cook will be fine .
what about some very cool sneakers ?
then why do n't you try some steak ?
i do n't have the slightest clue .
this ca n't be the right stop .
yeah right ! but you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
yes ! but a professional conversation conversation only a few seconds of coffee ! so if you buy a pair of clothing you have no taste .
i feel like having some dumplings with chinese food .
what kind of soup do you want ?
yeah you should also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol . you can keep them as much as you drink .
thank you ! this is very comfortable !
yes sir . how about this one ? it 's a popular dish .
what 's the special today ?
i have no idea . i 'm sure you 'll like this .

i think i will get a burger and a cup of coffee .
this is a gift .
i can not do it but i think it 's too heavy .
i am glad you like it .

i think so .
did you see anyone come into the block flats ?
we 're not sure . let 's go to the top .
what do you want to do ?
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials ignite it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .
yes . i 've seen some <unk> trees in the southern part of the city .
well this is the only thing i 've ever heard . . . i know the cost of worse than the market is n't it ?
here we have a bus stop .
not good . i lost my wallet .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
what can i do for you today ?
i got on about fifteen minutes ago .
o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room sir ?
not much .
you have your own vehicle ?
i do n't need a car . i walk to work .
do you want one ?
it 's your idea to save the day .
thank you . do you think the price is better than mine ?
we can get both at the cafeteria .
can you believe that ?
do n't worry . we can reach our beijing team as soon as possible .
but give yourself some time . you just got here .

ok . well after you get the line to change you have an outside line . who are you trying to call ?
i got it from ikea .
i ca n't believe it . what are the hours of the bus ?
i m not kidding .
i am very sorry to hear that .
i 'm okay with walking .
hi tom .
oh my god . i have n't seen you for ages . what about you ?
that 's great .
yes . i can teach you how to use the internet .
this is the kitchen . every thing 's new .
i did !
you like panda express ?
i think that i might have interest .
i see . but our sales brake and our sales revenue are not satisfactory .
i think i 'm going to get something to eat .
wow ! you are really a heavy smoker .
i apologize . i know you are a little worried about this .
i am working on my family .
if there 's nothing i can do about that . maybe i can go to the drop by myself .
well it is expensive to take a few days to get to the university .
really ? what happened ?
honey why do n't you go to bed and have a good rest ?
ok i will try my best to avoid me in a minute .
no problem .
i know but i 'm going to have to get stuck in the traffic jam .
this is all right ?
i can do that . but you need to go to the university station first .
off hand i 'd say the reader 's digests is my favorite .
what 's in your opinion ?
how do i use it ?
what can i do for you ?
i 'm trying to send the instruction book by email but i failed many many times . and there is something wrong with the net maybe . it 's so slow .
i am sorry for that . we will arrange another one for you .
i was robbed .
i think it was nothing serious . my husband just told me that she had done a lot of money and i m going to have to let her go .
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
i think that the police officer is going to give you the wrong way .
i think i want to try a new style .
so what happened ?
i have been studying english since high school .
i know how you feel . i thought maybe it was .
no i have n't . i 'm going to travel very light this time .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
at 10 o 'clock .
i like business management and i think the most important thing is that we can learn together .
what 's your favorite dance ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
i do n't need a car . i walk to work .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
well there 's one thing .
what ?
i have a high fever and a bad headache .
well there are many ways to save money . surely you can do it .
i bought one size up by mistake .
well we do it . but we need to know about the neighbors .
can i do anything else ?
fine . how are you doing this morning ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
well i 'm from studying english literature . i 'm an excellent student .
i 'm an <unk> with a live band about 10 years old .
i 've only been so interested in that apartment for several years .
i 'll do my best .
would you like cash back ?
what would you do if i leave the message ?
it s my acceptance letter from ucla .
i 'm not really satisfied with it .
because the hottest season is summer in a year .
i 'm pretty sure you know . i 've been reading chinese dishes since i really do n't know much about the world .
of course not .
i think so . i am lucky to be his wife .
that 's ok .
i am worried about the meeting this morning .
do n't worry . i ll help you get at the university with you .
i see .
because the hottest season is summer in a year .
then i need a money order for 250 dollars .
english test band 6 .
i like the job though . it 's not a problem .
we can take the subway . it 'll be faster than there .
how long will it take to get there ?
exactly .
that would be very expensive . so many people are in your country . that means that they will have a lot of difficulties .
do you think it s a good idea to have a language with us ?
i think i will stay in on sunday .
you re going to take courses ?
yes i am going to take some university courses there .
do you have any other questions ?
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
okay . i 'll see you again next week .
i 'll get a call to you later .

and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
of course . it 's on memorial avenue .
that sounds pretty good . thanks for your time .
you can check out two books at a time .
got it . thank you so much .
for two weeks . after that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer .
i see . thank you very much for your trouble .
there are many ways to go to . please come to the university and see if you need a course .
does it suit me ?
you 're welcome .
my name is sam . what 's the weather like in your family ?
my name is sam .
nice to meet you too .
yes i 've just come from fact . i 'm from taiwan .
can i help you get it to me ?
well i would like to see the old faithful for myself .
this pamphlet shows you what is the most important thing . but when you have a good time .
is that right ? is n't your company part of the family ?
why ? it 's amazing to live in america !
i am going to miss the people 's birthday .
how many kids do you think it would be like ?
will you be able to make it ?
really ? but you must have had fun .
wow ! i would n't do it . i 'm afraid i have n't made it .
it 's a pleasure to see you on the way to china .
i was n't able to attend the class that day .
yes i 'm going to the states .
i want to take a driver 's course .
when is the problem ?
it 's right . if you do n't mind sharing room with others in the same way .
you are a good student .
i 'm going to need a driver 's course .
do you know what kind of tea do you prefer ?
i see . did you go to the english corner ?
yes i 'm afraid not . you see that the red bar is the one . . .

not very well . he said he was the most good .
you think he 's a very good husband .
you could give me a definite answer . you are likely to find a job .
do you have any other questions ?
i took a parttime job in translating and doing reception work for an exhibition . my major was english translation and interpretation .
you speak really well .
do you think that 's a good spot ?
do n't you think that 's impossible ?
of course not . after my school record was above average in my class .
it 's going to be a lot of fun .
i messed up my midterm exam so badly today !
did you guys go on a date already ?
yeah .
i 've noticed you 've been working overtime a lot .
it 's so close .
well i took all my courses such as philosophy logic ethics aesthetics etc .
it would be a lot of hard to give you a chance to relax . i think that 's the right .
did you see the red light ?
it was n't as high as i would have liked . it was 2 . 5 .
yeah it 's been a great game .
i went there on business .

oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
what do you need ?
you mean that we can t catch it .
no it is not . there is no such a large one . the dairy section is where you want to go .
i can tell you if there 's a convenience store around here .
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i am worried .

i want to speak to you about this year s election .
oh is that all ?
i feel very nervous about it .

i will stay at the english corner of china .
i understand that . when you find something wrong with the job you ve been holding .
do you have any other outside income from our company ?
oh i remember a case that was filled with obstacles . the first thing i did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . i was wondering if i had done with our colleagues and made some recommendations before . the food was amazing that had similar to the experience .
what ? what is it ?
i agree with you on that . but i think we can make it more favorable .
what do you mean ?
that s strange ! what does it say ?
i think you re right . maybe that s true . try to get more publicity for foreign language and language .
ok ! this is really a good opportunity for you to be happy with your performance .
very well . thank you .
what can i do for you today ?
i need to get a passport .
what can i do for you ?
i need to know if i have any fees to pay .

i forgot about that section .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
i see .
sure it 's no trouble at all .
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
are you nuts ? how can that be ? i don t think it s gonna be !
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
did you go to the top of the eiffel tower ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to cancel one of my accounts .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
great . can i take it with me now ? or do you need me to fill in some forms or something ?

i 'm not sure it is . i do n't like it very much .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
that sounds like a good idea .
no . i needed to ask her out for a moment .

i like it . well i don t think it s a lot of fun .

i do n't think
could i see your passport please ?
good luck ! i will start the day after tomorrow .
okay what can i get you ?
i 'm sorry .
they 're all right .

to be honest i 'm not sure if i could but i 'm a little worried about my grades .
the stock exchange where i worked was too small my further promotion was impossible . i am able of more responsibilities so i decided to leave .
why ?
yeah !
good ! we will look at the new project manager . will you be working with him on it ?
there are several things that i like to do . i ve always wanted to take them seriously .

i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
how long would you say it will take me to get a bachelor 's degree ?

i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .

dark blue .
how old is she ?
twenty .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .

do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great ! i think i 'm in a bit of a lion dance . my friend is really funny .
good . let 's go now .
all right .

what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
because i want to tell you that i m an excellent girl .
i was just thinking about getting a bite to eat .
that s wonderful . i could always use a lot of training .
thanks . and you 're right now i think i can figure this out .
you know that i care for you .
why do n't you wear purple one ?
you think ?
that s right . plus i agree with his policies .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
hi there .
really ? what !
excuse me miss . what 's the tour time we have ?
it s only a few minutes away from the street to get there .
ok . i 'm not going to be able to take my my my advice today .
i 'll teach you how to get my papers and make sure that you are on the way .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
eh so so so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
how was your game at all ?
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
how was it ?
thanks mom .
do you have any other symptoms ?
anyway i think i need a nose job and some breast implants as well .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on mom . i 'm your a ! wait till the guys hear about this !
are you kidding ?
but i like wearing tshirts and jeans .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i m going to the hospital .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
my computer wo n't turn on .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know that . i know that these sorts of things hard to say . they wo n't like it if i tell them to turn off the tv . now i just hope the show will end soon .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you think that jobs are a bit low ?
i have already known that . i did n't get the scholarship right ?
it s my acceptance letter from ucla .
i did !
i could n't agree with you more . when you start i knew the game i would be so excited about it .
how much do you earn ?
i think i 'm your lucky fellow .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
thanks for coming .
when do you leave ?
i 'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth .
i 'll take the six more minutes .
goodbye . thanks again for everything .
nothing much . what 's new with you ?
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
gotta go . call me tonight .
okay . check you later .
i was robbed .
you gotta have some better deodorant .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?

i am going to buy a new air conditioner for my parents . oh it s two o clock . i must go now .
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
goodbye . see you again sometime .
i 'm on my way out to a new year 's banquet . how do i look ? is it all right ?
it 's as plain as the nose on your face . they 've been dating for ten years .
how ay ! the roses are getting along with each other .
well you can bet this relationship is a little dangerous . but you can bet this is going to be a flash in the pan .
it must have been love at first sight because i know he was a kind of strange guy .
i think you are absolutely right . actually my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . they got married a month later .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it s just one of those things .
you do ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
do you know any kind of concert he 's beautiful ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
i do n't drink too much .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
so am i .
it 's just the two of you .
is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ?
oh it s time to speak in the evening .
yes let 's go .
i hope that it does rain .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
do n't you think it is dangerous ?
yes . i think you re terrific .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
i want to go to her home .
of course not !
i prefer to read novels with you .
why not ?
if you have a blow you 'll receive your ticket and and and your phone number should be fine .
thank you .
thanks thanks mary . that would be a great help .
i know . i 've been working for the last few months .
it s my acceptance letter from ucla .
oh i see . so what about going on with the tennis team ?
it s hard to say ! but i think that the first family is too expensive .
i hope so .
really ?
what do you mean janice ?
i 've got a fever and a very sore throat .
it 's ok . take care of yourself .
you 're right . i will have to wait a while .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . .
i would like to have a photo with me .

thank you . which gate should i go to for the bus ?
you 're welcome .
what 's the rush hour ?
yes .
and about time too !
yes it is .
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
the car park is so beautiful . it was very expensive .
you have to read books about america and america .
yes we did . i enjoyed the trip . it was terrific .
all right . i 'm almost finished .
i do n't know . i m so sorry .
i like the color and her flowers .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily .
he 's got a promotion .
really ? maybe he can move now .
it 's true . he is a hard worker .
well they look very sensitive and casual .
why not you say so ?
the ones here are the ones that you can see on the queen shelf .
i do n't know . either one of the big bang . how can we get it to the problem ?
could you come to the front of you ?
i think you have a lot of homework .
oh my god . i 'm totally mad .
yes i saw a science program . it was quite a bit of a surprise .
i quit my job as a food critic .
i like spring .
well why do n't you go on a diet ?
me too . i hate playing basketball too .
i love watching football games on the river .
it is . don t worry . i ll take you there .
what about this one ?
i think you should go and get plenty of sleep .
my name is paul . is there anything else i can do for you ?
i all set . please do it .
quite well . i took a lot of care of the courses . in fact i took a lot of courses . i was in the past a terrific time . i was in the worst worst part of the courses i wanted some took the courses . i was excellent exams so i think i was doing quite good .
that s right . it seems that they are in the end of the world .
they might actually win the game .
i see . the police officer makes the call in the hospital .
yes .
well i guess i 'm a little nervous . anyway this is a kind of thing that i never went to do .
i m not kidding .
yes i like to watch the football match .
i will but i 'm already in a hurry !
fine ! each of us can do it .
oh we just cut the price down . we have about forty factory workers and the other is the same thing .
the board of directors for one year and he often have a steady job .
he 's the one who pulled out of the company .
that sounds like fun .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
yes . i 'm learning chinese through songs .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
well it 's a english song . i guess it 's right made of pure silk .
let 's go !
i can take a picture of the book .
i knew there would be a lot of prizes in the world .
i 'm finished . you can have it now .
well i think i 'm going to fail it .
well take it easy . they just mentioned you want to send a photograph for fax .
i get along pretty well with that . she listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .
what about he like ?
i agree . he is good at the olympics . do you think we can do something about it ?
he 's really influenced by the way . i think he 's the most suitable person for this company .
that 's great !
the same to you !
the same to you !
i 'm not sure . i have n't gone out for a while .
i 'd like to but i 'm not sure if i 'll have a chance .
i 'd be delighted to john . saturday did you say ?
thank you sir .
she is absolutely wonderful .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
mr . smith ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
what 's on ?
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
ok . well after you get the line to change you have an outside line . who are you trying to call ?
steven i 'm not at all .
yes i have read that someone who has passed out of college .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
has anybody spoken to you about it ?
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
it 's gone with the wind .
what do you want to read ?
the idea is that i 've been having this problem for three years .
i see . that 's why i did n't realize it was so rude to stop seriously .
i feel like having to catch the plane .
what happens if the risk of the limits ?
the facial will tell you what it says .
i think it s wonderful .
really ? i want to go too .
let me see . there 's one left in the nonsmoking room and those are twentyfive .
it s a pity !
no doubt . the brazilian team will win .
you mean we should start with the problems .
do you think that 's a good idea ?
yes i think so . the air is still covered with snow .
why is it so much worse ?
yes the snow is out of the world . it s also a common feeling of the mountain in the north .
no . as far as i remember he was supposed to be on a business trip to <unk> .
then she is not short .
it looks more like a toy or a cool briefcase !
he is also an allright guy . i think he 's a big problem .
yeah he really went to play video games on the internet .
yes i agree with you . all the countries are free of traveling around us .
yes some people have realized that people used to play ball as child is concerned .
your daughter is very happy with that .
i have to go to work this way .
what a pity !
she 's the teacher 's pet that she had a rich dog .
i 'm not sure . i just read it .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
yes . our guest team is really tough .
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
i 'm just glad to hear that . but i do n't know how to use the master 's degree to the united states .
is that sue ?
is that sue ?
my name is sam .
would you kindly spell it for me ?
ping . ping .
what do you do ?
i 'm from new york . what about you ?
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i loved it very much . the score was excellent .
anything else you say can make yourself comfortable .
i think so . it s around 80 isn t it ?
did you see his last dive ?
thank you so much it 's perfect !
he 's diving for the gold .
nothing special . i just watching tv .
not much just a guess .
i ca n't believe it .
oh that 's too bad .
yes . he just ca n't find a boss .
what is he like ?
good that 's a good idea . but it really hurts .
maybe i should talk to him about it next time .
all right . gotta go bye keep in touch .
neither . the game ended in two all .
what is your date of birth ?
china beat brazil 3 to 0 .
there is no one available . but there is a big fight with the yellow father who wants it to be the several letters .
what 's your favorite sport ?
don t worry . it s just that you are a good thing .
exactly ! you want to send one of the latest model to a professional suit ?
yeah . but why is that ?
he is not young as he looks . i think it 's going to be a great shock .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .
are you crying ?
yes i always cry at <unk> .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
yes they are .
is it the rush hour now ?
in fact we are beginning to make preparations .
for the wedding ?
no no no for the engagement .
try to catch this bouquet then .
yes . i 'd like to book a table for 2 at 730 tomorrow evening .
no thanks . i 'm just browsing .
ok . i 'll be happy to help . you know if we can make some changes in this restaurant .
i had a wonderful dinner party at the city . i would like to make some suggestions .
oh about 10 miles . it takes me about an hour .
are you sure ?
thank you for saying so .
thank you very much . that 's very kind of you .
i plan on going back to school .
how about going to english corner with me ?
no problem ! have you decided to add the car yet ?
oh i did n't . it was terrible .
are you kidding ?
yes but i think it is too fierce . that makes me like the most .
but sometimes the men like us .
hello john !
wow your apartment is a mess . what s up ?
i went up on my return office .
i 'm fine thanks .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
well ! it 's really exciting !
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
oh good . if you do n't mind if i can .
what time do i need to make an appointment for ?
do n't you hit it off ?
2 years .
i think we should take a few weeks to get together and enjoy being done .
i had a terrific working relationship with my boss . she told me the truth that i 'm a bit worried about my work .
what does she look like ?
oh no . i thought you were going to be a heavy smoker .
hmm . . . i heard he was also a politician . com .
what happened ? are you going to see him again ?
for how many people ?
hmm . i can make it . i 'm free next week .
i do n't know anything about the do you ?
well i 'm a big fan of snoop dog .
what ?
they are exciting and very challenging too .
yeah . i m pretty easy to remember . i ve always wanted to be good at making new food . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
me too . but i have no idea what to get .
i was thinking about it . i think it was n't too much though .
by the way can you tell me what the date it is today and what day it is please ?
yes you can also see the <unk> .
we had a lot of friends .
i think that we have . the thing is that she has done a lot of homework .
not bad . i 'm afraid i 'll have to be a planet too much time .
how so ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yeah . he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .
really ? what happened ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
did you see the honeymoon ?
he is but he was in a bad mood after her .
it must be strange for you to live in taiwan .
it does n't matter . if you want to hear the problem is the least they will fix it .
sorry i do n't know .
i wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . it was priced at forty dollars so i started by offering the salesclerk thirty .
then what did he say when he was in college ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
wow ! is n't it wrong ?
he tried to leave with the money .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
how did he make a fortune ?
yes . that is a wonderful suggestion .
sure ! i 'll try to !
great !
he is a good player .
i agree . and it 's very convenient .
i see . how do i get the card ?
great ! let 's try some of them .
to tell you the truth it was completely accidental .
i can go to your party on friday night . would you like to go with me ?
i tried to call you to think about her .
i think that we had our differences for the next two weeks . we got on the grass when we was on the road .
have you fallen in love ?
of course . i 'm still waiting for her .
i think that is the thing we had done . we got a lot of problems from the police . there was no idea a thing about our very good job .
i think that the cat had a litter too much of him .
i asked him how long it took me to learn english .
it 's my pleasure . so what are you going to do with your windfall ?
bye .
that 's good . how much will it cost ?
you 'll get used to it .
that is very kind of you to say so . . .
well i certainly could n't have done it without your help . you are the best tutor i 've ever had .
no thanks .
no problem . see you at the conference .
see you !
sure . it is one of the best beers .
do you have any family on her ?
and it 's common in any special tv programs .
what 's the difference between the two styles of the new year ?
i think so . i bought two concert by the radio this evening .
it 's great ! how will it be ?
as much as you like . we are free of charge .
that 's a good idea . i ca n't wait .
because i don t think my husband would like it . thank you for inviting me anyway .
that 's horrible ! i ca n't wait to see it .
it 's a hotel but cheaper and offers free parking .
yes . oh no wonder you are so respectful to me .
there is one just around the corner .
and which direction were you going ?
the party starts at 8 .
fine . let 's get a table and we 'll be at the back .
i 'm not going to be late . i just need to go to sleep .
yes i should go now .
if you 're lucky that might do the trick .
what 's more the time now ?
so what were you calling me about ?
and here 's my present address .
i 'm glad to hear that . i 've got a beautiful dress .
i know . i have to be going now .
what 's the specialty of your country ?
the festival is going to be held on october 15th .
what do you celebrate your new job ?
do you still remember our first date ?
do you eat a lot of special dishes ?
she is an accountant .
no fireworks are awesome !
really ?
it 's well too large for me . it seems to be of an easy time to deal with and how they manage .
i think so .
do you have any suggestions ?
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . .
good idea . how about some spring rolls and squid balls some pork skins and some beer !
which ones do i need to take ?
it 's a sitcom from channel 10 and a small movie .
i ca n't believe it . it 's so cool .
yes . what can i do for you ?
what about as long as i have a computer ?
yes . with the 600 second digital memory l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
wow ! that sounds really good .
you need to stop the computer .
early next month . in the meantime i should be very pleased if you would like them . i hope that the goods can be dispatched promptly after you get my l cb
well i think it 's a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . but i 'm afraid i 'll try to get back together again .
how about rose ? it 's the most suitable one for lovers .
thank you . i 'm sure our wedding anniversary is a great time .
do n't worry . i 'll give you a call .
oh my god ! it 's so beautiful !
why not ? can we go on a business trip to the competition ?
twilight rates are 21 dollars .
is this a bathroom ?
no i am afraid not .
we already offer a loan .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
oh what 's on it ?
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
well i 've got a better job .
then what are you going to do ?
thanks . i was happy with it . i had no idea you were happy now .
it must be a big game .
that 's terrible ! what do you think ?
your luggage is two pounds of luggage . i m sorry sir . we are fully booked in the nonsmoking rooms . the bellboy will take you to your room . have a nice stay .
because the hottest season is summer in a year .
i m glad i finally got the job .
i go . i have a lot of friends .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
you 're right . i tried my best to get away .
no i think it 's enough .
ok . thanks .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .
how about your teachers ? does she even know you 're using the same language ?
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
i got them .
yes . i 'm a little confused about the time . how about the internet ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
why didn t you phone me from a callboy ?
i went there last time .
really ? how did you know that ?
no .
great ! congratulations !
forget it . we seemingly need to gather money little by little .
it s my pleasure to meet you too .
are you going to find a chinese restaurant or a double one ?
ok . there are no one who needs to be his careful .
no please feel free .
thank you .
i just got back from work .
i 'm glad to meet you too .
waltz is a good choice . i like it better than any other dances .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i 'd like to be a singer . you know i 'm not so crazy .
because you are the most attractive person .
yeah a dancing queen . wanna go and join them ?
that 's all right .
sounds really good !
no . the chinese think they are not very good . many of the chinese dishes are usually studying and that have a lot of fun .
is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west the purpose is generally quite <unk> savor the wine .
what kind of sport do you have ?
he was but the whole team has gone as hard as he was when he was driving .
i see so this is the advantage of having such an eye towards inspection .
it 's hard to say .
absolutely i love temple fairs . beijing has several temple fairs recently . they are different from each other to some extent but also have a lot in common .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . th
hmm . i like movies . do you know how i am about this place ?
ok let 's go .
oh ! i ca n't believe it . when are you going to see her ?
i know . but it 's definitely scary .
not really but i like it very much .
well i m really interested in living .
you 're a good dancer .
good idea . i 'd love to try it .
sounds good . just a minute please .
how about going to give me a glass of beer ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
thanks you . shall we stand a bit further ? i would like to take the tower in .
yes i do . it 's my favorite .
i guess i 'm glad exams are over .
i see . the computer is so skillful with its quality .
it says smoking is not allowed in any private offices . it might be the most terrible thing for you .
that 's not true .
not at all . we can go to a disco after dinner .
that 's right . we have to dispose of them .
what a disco ? no one is ok .
sounds like a good idea .
yeah . i heard that if you 're in love with someone you can dance it .
it 's very nice .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
swimming . what about you ?
what about spring ?
no i 'm afraid not .
i see . does n't it close to the station ? i 'm not a lot of fun !
i think the most important issue is for a person with a can do without snow .
what kind of power do you want to have ?
yeah . it 's already december you know .
what do you mean ?
that s a good idea
good luck !
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring best . it is neither too cold nor too hot . freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . how about you ?
may i ask you for a dance ?
it s the best season for a picnic right now . have you decided the place for your picnic ?
it 's good to be like this . i 'm sure it 's going to rain soon .
it is so beautiful after the summer .
it 's really a big favor . i like autumn too .
i like the winter but it gets too cold .
it 's usually windy in march . it 's always warm in april and may but it rains sometimes .
i like spring too .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
the weather is gorgeous here . we have a lot of natural park .
is it very cold in winter ?
anything else ?
yes that 's true .
no i 'm not .
you mean i 'll share the taxi ?
oh i 'm sorry .
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
not at all .
what 's the problem ?
it 's very kind of you . how long have you been here ?
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
sure what is it ?
i want to order a large birthday cake several kinds of cold dishes pastries and fruits .
next week .
what 's the hurry ?
i 'll be there . you 're still a fabulous cook are n't you ?
i am free tomorrow .
uh . . . no i 'm gonna make a phone call .
i 'd love to .
on the floor .
really ? i did n't have time to go to school .
this afternoon .
ok we can book you a private room for up to ten people at that time . could you give me your name please ?
thank you for going to be there .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green <unk> . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
what 's wrong with it ? it 's filthy !
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
no thank you
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
i know ! i am sorry to hear that ! but i 've got to go now .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
you are welcome . and if you have any problems later i will call you when we go .
do n't mention it . you can go anywhere .
i 'd like to . you 're welcome .
nothing . i am just killing time with my boss .
did he have any children to eat any kind of plate ?
yes he does .
me too . i think he s really a shoulder to cry on .
i 'm waiting for their call .
you can say that again .
then do you think i should have a try ?
oh i 'm afraid i can t . i 'm going to be a date .
that 's too late . do n't worry . you can get a taxi till tomorrow .
this friday evening ?
let me see . . . the reservation is for 7 o 'clock .
it is not the only thing i 've ever had .
they are small dumpling balls made of glutinous rice flour . they are like tangun .
who 's your sister ?
no i am the only child in my family .
not too bad thanks !
it 's my pleasure . what can i do for you today ?
hi basil .
you re welcome . and welcome to our hotel again .
is the weather usually like this here ?
don t mention it . see you .
have you thought about applying for another job ?
but i do n't want to put this under control .
i do n't think so .
perhaps you can give her some idea of her looks .
me too . i have to get a new home before i can take your time .
i 'd love to . so you do n't have any <unk> at this time i think i 'd ever happen to get in with you .
oh i see . thanks for calling .
i know i know but i ve had a hard time available .
well good idea . you ll be doing more weight at school .
in that case i think you should look for another job .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
but i think people should save more money . remember to stop smoking here for the past few weeks .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and you 'd take some exercise every day .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i do n't believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
no . it s a pity about it .
that s a good idea .
yes well we have some available jobs .
which dress do you think should wear ?
do n't worry about that . this is really a good exercise for me .
almost always . most of the time is listen to .
i think so . i bought it in a department store .
it 's about a girl .
very interesting . so it seems you have had quite a lot of experience in history .
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
these shoes are good . they look nice .
i only washed my clothes for the winter .
but i am busy with work . the work is busy at night .
it 's hard to say . it depends on your health .
do you have any other questions ?
i know but i 'm not sure about the time .
definitely . i m really sorry !
yes you are right .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
stop beating around the bush . will you quit or not ?
no . i have n't had the fish in the house .
i guess so . i was n't born in madrid but i came to the states when i was a child .
i see . he has an characters on the value of it .
i know . let 's go and see what they 're going to do .
definitely . the language was excellent but they just played it fast .
oh cool ! i ca n't believe it !
basically you just ca n't drive .
absolutely i got an appointment at eight . thirty p . m . ?
i do know . the same story is just about how many miles away . it s almost the same .
right . i love them .
it 's a good idea . do you have any specials today ?
at 8p m tomorrow night .
july 2006 .
then my son drove into a tree
thanks a lot .
do you think we could go to the dinner table ?
okay . i 'll have it wrapped for you .
she has been admitted to a hospital .
i think it 's quite convenient for her to go to the united states .
about 12 years .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
she has been admitted to the hospital .
no i did n't fall asleep .
did you like to study english ?
yes i m afraid i am in a hurry .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i have a 10 yearold boy and a 6 yearold girl .
who s married ?
they are reserved for a response to their call . they are not addressed in business relationship with the name of an organization or wife . they are not used to be the complete waste of time management and there .
oh it s available now . how can i have this document ?
about 12 .
oh it s available now . what can i say ?
that 's right .
oh my goodness ! it s unfair .
yes i 'm teaching math at lincoln high school .
really ? she is very tall and slim .
she is still in a coma .
it sounds very emotional .
what are you going to do ? are you going to work late ?
it s very good .
why not ?
thanks a lot .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .
how old is he now ?
he is in his late thirties .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's checking bags . he s an official in the customs .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the <unk> young man .
oh that 's right . but we still have four left . could you please go over this counter ?
what about the one after that ?
a seat is ok . let me have a look .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .
i see . how sweet of you !
i hope it stays like this .
yes you do . but i want to ask you some questions about this job .
well there re still some real women who wants to be independent .
yes . but i think it 's going to be difficult to get married .
sure i just got him .
no i have n't .
why did you leave your last job ?
oh my computer crashed again !
i ca n't believe it . he was so nice of you to come to the wedding .
what are you going to do ?
yes i have a reservation .
i 'm interested in <unk> your company .
ok . goodbye .
that 's great .
you should pay him . he is a senator now .
yeah . he s been on the bus for ten minutes .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
what ?
i do n't have the slightest idea .
did you think about talking to her ?
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
i can only use the internet .
what kind of books do you like to read ?
well we offer a 10 charge for our members .
do you have any hobbies like playing chess ?
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall .
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
i 'd like to pay for it .
i guess i ll just have to tell mr . robinson that you re too busy every evening doing god knows what . . . god don t go on like this . if you absolutely refuse to take her out . .
well it 's very comfortable just to drift here .
em it 's delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
i 'm going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
i m just looking at this map of the world . i m preparing for a geography class .
that 's too bad !
hey do n't forget to buy a suit for me .
i 'd be happy to .
as soon as possible .
i 'll be there .
i 'd love to but i do n't know the local song that 's supposed to be great .
that sounds like a good idea .
thursday mornings . oh yes . why ?
i was thinking of seeing a movie .
it does n't matter . i 'll probably come round .
i think it would be a great idea .
oh it 's not bad . you know i had our greatest time in a while . is it the first time to try ?
i think it will be a little too expensive on me .
is that all the people who are going to have to pay for them ?
actually it is the truth .
why not ? you are the sort of guy .
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a bad cold .
yeah i ll be there .
of course . first of all the old buildings is going to have a great time to visit and breathe in the afternoon .
no i do n't . go to the bathroom room .
no problem .
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
no thank you .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
yes it 's not even noon yet .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
because the hottest season is summer in a year .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i ve got a suit made of these days .
hi joe . i am not sure what is it ?
i 'm glad you like it .
i have lived here for twenty years .
can you speak any other languages ?
do you think i can take a picture through this window ?
do you want some rice with that ?
yes . i love you so much .
anything else ?
i 've been out of town . i just got back from a meeting with you .
i just went to see my sister twice a year ago .
since last night .
and what do you think of it ?
i just graduated from college .
what is the problem ?
i 'm majoring in english .
yes sir . in this position i should start with the clients you are applying for in china .
i never know about the work .
hi ! what a great time !
i 'm glad to hear it .
i hope everything will be smooth .
yes . i graduated this past june .
and i 'm glad to meet you too .
fine and you ?
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yeah . are you kidding me ?
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
how long does it take ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
we have a lot of good fashion sense .
i know . but i m not sure if i d be happy to go for my family .
what are you talking about ? we ll have a beer .
oh she 's pretty sick .
she still loves him .
tom that lucky guy .
not good . the doctor told him not to smoke again but it just rolls off him like water off the duck s back !
that 's too bad . i bet he just had to leave his own grocery saying that my father died in the same neighborhood .
terrible
i see .
i do n't know .
oh no wonder you 're kidding .
it 's really a good lesson to them . the chinese culture might disagree with you but when you write a strong amount of money .
at least he is . what time does he have ?
he can say that again .
there is a fire in your building . you need to evacuate immediately .
there s a very good game at first .
the head door is so noisy . she is not too tall .
so she is n't causing you any problems ?
have you thought about going to a movie ?
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know but i was getting stuck in a bad mood at my moment . i think i might have a bad time to give her something to do .
i do n't know .
well some people just hope he 'll be in touch with me .
will you be paying some of that off today ?
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
i guess so . now anna 's got four kids and another on the way .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am afraid i ca n't attend the math meeting this morning .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right . he 's a hard worker .
really ? who was that ?
what was your score ?
thank you .
i think the most important thing is that i have a partner of college will be successful . but if i 'm willing to go back to help a lot of people . what can you do to help me with the chinese ?
he said he had to get rid of it .
yes it seems to be . but do you have a large circulation ?
we want to go to a formal dinner .
oh that s too bad . why don t you take some aspirin ?
ouch that hurts did you have anything from the kitchen ?
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
that 's really not a problem . but i am still not sure if it will work .
i m afraid i have to go back to the office .
i agree with you . but in this case we should have more confidence in our language .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
i 'm happy to hear that . is there anything else i can do for you ?
why is that ?
how he did this happen ?
a lot of people have to do that . it 's just the same .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him about it .
how so good . are you going to stay ?
no wonder you are so calm .
i will send someone out to my room right now . it will be a relationship with the problem .
it must be kate .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
he hit a right on the right . you should go .
you re right . i love you so much .
i like you . i am afraid i like the low girls .
i think so . it 's not too much to be true .
you can always bring them back to the <unk> and have a try .
i am not surprised . i just bought it . it 's not like your simple dance .
do you like her ?
yes i know .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
and so i bought all these books on having kids and . . .
can n't be better .
you have a good trip .
there are four people in my family .
how long have you been married ?
how old is your brother ?
i know but i 'd be happy to write a letter of recommendation for the scholarship .
i see . it must be very expensive .
it 's hard to say . for me his own brother i think it 's just a pleasant one .
what does he think of your family ?
we get together at the cafeteria .
oh come on ! i am really glad we 've been together .
thank you .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum i was hoping you d like to come with me .
i am afraid i ca n't i am going to be out all day .
what about sunday ?
i wish i could but it 's my mums birthday .
maybe next week .
much as i d like to i am afraid i <unk> be free next week i have a lot of work .
sorry to hear that i was really looking forward to spending some more time with you i really enjoyed our last chat .
i am really sorry too maybe i can give you a call sometime .
nothing really why what s up ?
if you are free maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . it will be fun you will get to know lots of people .
sounds great . i 'd love to .
around 3pm .
do you need help setting up or anything ? i do n't mind . i like to do that kind of thing . it 's fun and i have a good eye for decorating .
no . thank you . i can handle it but thanks for the offer .
ok i will see you then .
ok . bye .
the problem is she . he s a pretty woman .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
sometimes i think of how things could have turned out if i had done things a little differently .
what for ?
what do you think i should do about it ?
she is expecting .
of course each doctor has their own feeling .
yeah . we can find different kinds of products if you like .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .
ok great should i bring anything ?
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
do n't worry i will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty .
got it .
where was the breakin ?
you are are kidding !
yes ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
take it easy . they will get caught .
thanks for your help .
i think that unfortunately it s more important than a person s character . advertising and stuff tells us that we have to be attractive .
and the restaurant are excellent .
he is a lawyer .
you mean the guy you bought him a same car ?
no i don t think so . he s stopped by the guy who was peckham .
well i have them in this area .
why not ?
that s plenty of time yet . can you just take a quick bite to the chemist s ?
he might be good to hear .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
well why do you think that ?
definitely . but the most important thing is that you can t believe that at all !
oh really ? it s time for the whole weekend .
i 've been snowed under with work since my boss was away on business .
when did you get your degree ?
ok . for a while i m looking forward to cleaning the restaurant .
yes we are .
when are you getting married ?
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?
well . . . we ve got a lot of problems in st . albans .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
i just need to see some identification before i hand over the cash .
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
she 's very nice .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
i forgot . can i get a soda ?
it sounds like a good day .
you can also go to the sports field to play soccer and if you like .
thank you . it 'll be ready .
fine ! how are you ?
i 'm fine too thank you .
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
no . may i help you ?
may i introduce myself ?
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
good luck !
it 's just what i wanted .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages .
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'm afraid she 's out .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
i 'll be right back .
it 's the best way to get caught in a traffic jam .
that 's a good idea . i do n't like horror movies .
i told you to get off the phone with me .
you had a compact car ?
yes . may i help you ?
i m calling to offer you the position of computer engineer .
oh hi ! what s up ?
hi tom . he s having a meeting with mr . macmillan tomorrow afternoon . can you take a look at your bag ?
it looks great . i d love to .
how about at 330 ?
what time do you plan to come for the dinner ?
good evening david . good evening mary . it s so good of you both to come .
no . have you ?
i am glad you like it .
nice to see you again .
oh thank you .
how do you do ? nice to meet you ms . smith . i m jack stevens from the marketing department . here is my card .
hi this is john . i m calling to confirm the date of the next interview .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
fine today though a bit under the weather last week .
ok . i ll be glad to .
you ll feel better after you do .
i am not sure .
it sure is . you ve got plenty of training and you need to choose from a college that offers .
i have really bad poison oak and can t stop itching .
that s a great idea .
yes i am . i 've just been working overtime a week .
it 's rice wine a kind of still wine that are high in fat .
i need you to take care of your home before you can come out and take the documents .
yeah . why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
yes .
do you know any different types of people who do n't like us ?
i know . but there are still any left by the end of the week .
i see . i suppose the additional premium for employees is the use of the slow service .
i 'm afraid we do n't .
when i was a young boy i used to take the subway to get a better income . and then i had a few years ago . i mean some of them are cheaper than private collectors .
anything else .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
my parents just moved into the city with me . i thought the floor was just living in a onebedroom apartment .
i ca n't find my own place .
do you feel like seeing the movies ?
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
i remember my parents want me to live in a house when i was ten years ago .
my parents just didn t handle my older sister very well and because of that they want me to be more independent . they think that it 's a good thing i should do .
i know i have lived here for three years . i 'm just clever . i 've never found one of them .
oh almost all right . and your brother brother ?
i see . please fill out this form .
they wanted to be out of my family .
what did he do ?
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds good .
titanic ? what do you mean ?
i have some new clothes too . would you mind telling me a little more about it ?
i want to show my gratitude for helping me . how about going for a picnic ?
wow . i 'm impressed . when can you tell me about the real world ?
yes i know that . but there are the statue of liberty right now . and here are the rules i 've taken .
yes what is he like ?
he s the only one who tried to marry him .
oh i see . thank you .
that is a what he s think . i think he has pretty outgoing personality . but i don t think he s a good husband .
my parents have a lot of children . my parents say that dogs are usually busy at home .
no it s is n't . . . it s probably just that i think we had a crush on you .
yes it is . but she says she 's very careful .
i had my two years of experience but i am a bit worried about my career .
i believe they will .
oh that 's good . we have such a good reputation for us .
but if you are hired how long do you think you can be in school ?
she started a few years ago .
i see . did she want to come back for a while ?
let s ask you to come back to work and see what they have .
will there be a problem ?
i promise you that she wo n't be back until next week .
i ve been out of town .
and how long have you been in australia ?
i had a parttime job in beijing .
when did you leave ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick . i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no . if you can wait for a moment i 'll have a rest .
oh really ? so you mean you like the holiday ?
very well . i 've been rest of my life all day .
oh yes . i went to the gym and watched tv .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
i have already watched it .
ok . let s go together . how many times do you spend on your spare time ?
well i 've been here for one hundred years .
do you usually play badminton with your friends ?
i know !
well that 's true . i guess we should save more time like our life .
did you lose any weight ?
you can list your education at the top or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive .
what is it ? it ll be a rainy day .
why do n't we go to a concert instead ?
i think the most important thing is that you should do everything you can keep costs down and make sure that you are on the right things .
oh that s too bad . i want to know if you have a girlfriend .
no i did n't . i just watched the movie .
there 's a program on ancient egypt tonight .
right .
what do you mean ?
football is more exciting than you .
what kind of sport do you like to play ?
maybe we can play together some time .
you want to watch dragon boats compete against one another on the city river . it 's really exciting .
most people like football .
well i do n't know . what kind of sport do you like ?
do n't worry . it seems a little complicated .
i m not kidding . i just for fun ! that s why i never met a girl . how about you ?
that s true . i m sure that a doctor would love to be our part of some people . i could grow them by himself .
sure . let 's meet at the airport .
teachers ? ok that 's not a bad idea .
i think you re fantastic ! i can t wait to get a chance to see my parents .
i have a parttime job now so i know that i can find a little job .
it s a good idea . by the way what would you like to do ?
then i might just have a look at the safety manual of our company .
some of my friends play cards on the internet . if you aren t too much tv you can just learn how to use them .
it s not a simple thing to do . it s too cold for me to stop floating and i ll take care of the rest .
i guess i should just watch tv now .
good .
yes i hope so . we 've been expecting you for almost an hour .
that 's something else .
i think he 's got the flu .
i 'm glad to hear that .
i think so . they must be very loaded on their own .
i 'm not sure i want to try it but i want to be a lot of fun .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
anytime i 'm not sure . you should be this afternoon . i 'm under the seat .
fine ! i 'll get right on it now !
come on . maybe you can be a more careful game .
ok . i 'll go .
oh come on ! i just took a break . i 'm sure you need to put on your desk .
not bad . how about you john ?
yep . they 're just going to be making new friends .
if you hear me it keep still not paying your fine .
not bad . and then he 's going to sign his contract and then the beneficiary .
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
come on dear . i know you mustn t forget it .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s the anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
what happened ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he had better make a change .
what did he do ?
that makes sense . but i still can t wait to pick up my own suit .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
i was also interrupted by her last week because of such a thing .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
sure it 's just a piece of cake . but i do n't think my mom would like them .
can i apply for a special offer ?
like how ?
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
i am looking at the song .
what did he say ?
that 's right . she s just moved in yesterday .
i do n't have any cigarettes or spirits . i think i know the color of flowers in a city .
you mean with a man who comes down ?
how do you know about the job ?
if you go to the convenience store you 'll have to go to the movies .
that 's right . both pop and mark are experts with snow .
good idea . she is always willing to make a good boss .
well i know that . there are so many famous ones in the museum .
that s what it s so helpful .
not good . i 've got a good time in the doctor .
go on and talk to them right ?
i went to the library and i 'm scared .
really ?
no he did n't tell me about it .
sounds interesting !
i 'm not sure . come in until the moment .
well i am very familiar with the chinese folk songs .
i think i might .
don t you know who ll be fired ?
i ve made up my mind .
mom i do n't want to eat cooked chicken bones because they 're really healthy .
he 's coming by car for a while . we can be in the park with one family and he can get up for free .
i think it is something important to do it .
it was three all .
yes it is .
oh i see . do you have the same card ?
well there are many things i can do to help out my job .
yes i do .
that 's right . it 's only 9
i see . they are the oldest child . my mom used to play the game when he was little boy .
well we have n't had any cut in the car and so you 'd better adjust it to the road .
good idea . i 'll get a dozen .
yes . if you do that the workers won t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs .
what a pity !
i am really sorry .
yes i could be there at 6 o 'clock .
oh thank you for your reminding .
you are doing a lot of work in america .
what kind of food would you like ?
i do n't know . i 'll call my sister to have a pet .
yes . he loves the beautiful woman in his eye .
yes .
oh ca n't you see the notes ? it 's already past 10 .
who s not good at all ?
that ca n't be true .
it 's on the right side of the school .
hmm . that 's a bit too bad . i ll take the music .
you are welcome .
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
nice to meet you too . welcome to our corporation .
where are you from ?
good afternoon mrs smith .
well it 's ok . let 's ask .
would you like to make a withdrawal ?
i 'm in a bit of a hurry . i know it 's the kind of room . thank you very much .
i know . you can do it as well .
yes i know . some of the traditional exports are the believe that our products are not the same but they have a strong feeling . . .
yes the sunset hotel is three blocks away .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you can try to find a different route to get home .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
i 'm sure it 's a good idea . let 's go .
well i guess i 'll tell you what . . .
that 's right . i should go back to the hospital to pick up my wife s approval .
how about the costumes ?
i 'd love to catch it .
i said when was ten years old i d ever set up of eyes .
i see . all of them have great sense of humor . but now it 's too professional .
you 're right .
then how can i be of assistance ?
there are n't any good prizes in your account .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
thank you .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
it s a time to celebrate him !
let 's see that . how old is he ?
you know i 'm about to graduate and i have to look for a job as soon as possible . but i haven t the faintest idea of how to go about finding a job .
how about playing the river road ?
yeah . you can find an interesting job in this magazine .
ok let me get it .
it is really cool .
i 'd like to .
one pound of ac has given ice cream . in my country there are plenty of golf courses on the back of course .
he is not very good at tennis isn t he ?
yes it does . who play guitar has been <unk> and cheerful .
play it might be a bit too slow . everyone is fed up with the rushhour traffic .
there are many types of games and almost 100 seconds .
that 's not why your father did n't show up the game .
no . they are not very serious about anything . they are also very <unk> and don t have many side effects .
and the streets are heavy with traffic .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
what about taking them outside and flying a kite .
i know . i really like the way that i feel more comfortable right now .
may i have a look at it please ?
what ? why ?
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
yeah it was . i had no idea when i was a little boy .
oh i see . maybe i can find my own pair of sticks and a few tests .
oh . i 'm afraid i 'll have the fish .
well ok i ll feel better now . you know i m ok running away too .
no .
ok we should get them ready this afternoon .
no i did n't get a horrible one .
i think it 's about the cost of living in a few days .
well i 'd like to take the one that goes to the wild animal park .
i think that the thing is right . i always do something like this .
i agree but a lot of people would never give them money . it 's just so convenient .
could you make it on the rocks ?
absolutely . that s why we have to drive to the country . besides i think the government should do a lot of traveling and private cars .
well you should have more money then .
i have been on the top of that there are several large chemical factories in the suburbs which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
that s true . i love being <unk> with my parents and i never know how to turn around for a free time .
no what do you mean ?
really ?
i can understand that .
he 's better than me .
let 's go to his office . it 's urgent . please leave him the message for him .
there is something in what you said but what would you say about the country ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
he might be right . he might be allergic to pollen . it s a cold but it s not easy being cold .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
it s a hard question . it s hard to say .
so you must like nba game .
it s a <unk> .
that s a good idea . you can get a move to the park next door .
yes they re very hardworking .
that 's unavoidable but think how would you keep up to date without television ?
which one is your favorite ?
i think john is the best player i can do .
hey i m not too tired . i m too tired .
what position do you play ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what s you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i know what you mean . i have an idea of how some clothes they are . the <unk> from taiwan is just fifth <unk> in america .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
now please wait until your flight is called . there 's about twentyfive minutes to go .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
great . thanks for letting me know .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well we used to talk to each other before we were married . remember ?
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
what did he say ?
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
i really do n't think this weather will last .
by the way my name is liu wei .
no .
here 's the key . thank you very much .
thank you . mr . smith . i 'll be sure to take care of his luggage . you 'll be sure to arrive before 4 pm .
hi navy . this is my first time to talk with you .
i like a house with a nice view of the city . how about you ?
what 's in it like ?
i have a test tomorrow .
what 's the matter ?
yes .
i 'm behind behind back to work so i 'd like to extend my stay longer .
oh no . i 'd like to . but i do n't have any appointment with me .
pardon ?
what time is it please ?
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
ok . when will we go ?
you 're absolutely right . i think it 's worth trying .
we usually go to the cafeteria .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ?
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
why ?
i am sorry sir . i ca n't wait to get there right now .
it does n't matter .
it 's fine sir . this is the table .
i had a terrible day .
thank you . please sit down .
yes it 's definitely a <unk> . i have n't seen you for a long time .
i could n't agree with you more . do n't you think it 's appropriate for us to bring out all the clothes in the house ?
i have a lot of friends .
all right . but it was a really good game .
we have to find a shelter . i 'll be really looking forward to that !
well you could take a look at the bag . there 's a lot of paperwork .
okay . i want to get a ticket first .
it 's my pleasure . hope you can visit beijing more often .
sure . i 'd like to eat chinese food . as long as you are hungry then .
oh . i am sorry to have thought of that . maybe we can order some hot dogs .
do n't mention it .
are you serious ?
no why ?
what was your major in ?
what do you mean ?
usually it 's very complicated . just leave it to the circulation desk and leave your back .
what is the annual salary of the training ?
first of all you should get prepared to make sure everything is paid attention to your personal trainer .
wow ! thank you for your help .
if that 's the case then we could go to work . i 'm afraid we have to force him to do this .
oh here . go ahead .
good idea ! i ve been working too hard to get a good job . how are you ?
not bad . i 'm sure our cooperation will be fine . and we 've been doing much better than the last few days .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
did you have a question to sign there ?
do you have your cell phone with you ?
it does n't take much time to say . i would have to take that many more than the score .
good ! how are you doing ?
um that ll be a great idea . let s go .
we will have an appointment if we can get there on time .
maybe that 's a good idea .
yeah i ll get that .
oh no ! that s too bad . i d love to do it .
what would you do ?
thank you ! in that case i am 26 years old and what about yourself ?
oh i m sorry to hear that .
ok . how about some spring rolls ?
you should put that on the floor and put a green carpet in the truck .
well i just saw a horror movie last night . it almost frightened me to death .
the players are wonderful .
yes good . i 'm going to have to give you a ticket .
well may i have a look at your costume ?
can i see the rainbow ?
really ? are you sure ?
yeah ! why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 'd like to say yes . i have been here for almost three years .
don t worry . my husband always talked to you .
because the hottest season is summer in a year .
you mean a lot to say ?
no it is haven t done it . he s probably a good team player .
i m fond of snakes . i think they are great . i agree with you about spiders though . i think spiders are horrible . i think it s because they have so many legs .
well it 's an amazing job . what about the new news ?
no . but it 's not your fault . you can do it tomorrow .
don t worry . i ll drive you there .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow i didn t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
oh sure . the number of our school is next to it .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
would you like to go to dinner or something ?
all right it 's a date .
of course not i appreciate that .
perfect ! you need a second that you can use the computer .
no sir . you could use it for your computer .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
what 's wrong with it ?
yes . what about you ?
all right . take care of it .
yes . i like facing danger and overcoming it . it has become part of my life .
thanks .
it 's business .
well i think this going to be a little late .
yes .
what are you doing ? i ca n't help falling asleep .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i 'm sorry but i ca n't .
be seeing you then .
goodbye .
so what are you talking about ?
could you tell me something about the original state and the amount of classes you have please ?
well i d love to but i m not sure if i can get a beer and play .
i think you re right . i ve tried that many times but i just can t bear it that well .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
does he have a family car ?
i think you re right . he was trying to cheat on people as her .
oh so i heard . that 's why i 'm telling you about this coming . i think it 's a bit strange .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
do you think it 's a good idea ?
ok please hold it .
they are . i read about how much you have done .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's what we like to do .
i 'm afraid not . i have to learn so much about the training course .
from china .
you ll see .
it 's ok . where ?
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
hi . steven . i just drop in and want to have a chat with you .
yeah . i was there a couple of times . you know how i am . i can t believe it when my boss told you were .
but you were in touch with her .
i did not know that . i guess that i won t be able to get any information about .
so what are you saying ?
if i wanted to be more careful i would be able to offer our clients on the basis . besides i am very satisfied with your company .
sure .
yes what is he like ?
he s the only one who tried to marry him .
oh i see . thank you .
that is a what he s think . i think he has pretty outgoing personality . but i don t think he s a good husband .
my parents have a lot of children . my parents say that dogs are usually busy at home .
no it s is n't . . . it s probably just that i think we had a crush on you .
yes it is . but she says she 's very careful .
oh almost all right . and your brother brother ?
i see . please fill out this form .
they wanted to be out of my family .
what did he do ?
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds good .
titanic ? what do you mean ?
i have some new clothes too . would you mind telling me a little more about it ?
i want to show my gratitude for helping me . how about going for a picnic ?
do n't mention it . it s my pleasure . we have been thinking of getting together with you .
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i did n't want to be late . but i was the first one there .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
but why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it s only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
the same to you !
i said merry christmas ! do n't you know that christmas is almost here ?
oh that s nice . thank you .
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen . there 's also a garden .
well i would say that i m not a religious person . it s so old !
forgotten about it ? how could you ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i can t remember .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
don t be so sure . i ll be glad to do the christmas first . it will be a pity if you don t mind being there s something to do .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town .
and how long have you been in australia ?
i had a parttime job in beijing .
when did you leave ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick . i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no . if you can wait for a moment i 'll have a rest .
my name is judy . what s your name ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . .
this is my first child .
yes of course . i 've been here for nearly two years . i think the color itself is fine though .
no i often go there with my friends .
of course ! it s a good school . if you can make it yourself tomorrow .
no . i don t . i m sorry . we re very busy at the moment . is this your first break up ?
oh i just ca n't help it . you know it was a touching movie .
yes i have been here for three years .
no i don t . i go on a winter holiday instead . i go somewhere warm .
so that 's everything done for you .
what are the other members of your family ?
i know i need to learn a lot from english . i wonder if you would go there too .
thanks for the advice . i ll get it on time .
i m really sorry for that .
why not ? you ve spent so much time at the moment . i think you ve made a good decision to start by working with us .
i have spoken my mind and can t go anywhere now .
yeah it s true . i m always excited about going out and making a good impression .
i had my two years of experience but i am a bit worried about my career .
i believe they will .
oh that 's good . we have such a good reputation for us .
but if you are hired how long do you think you can be in school ?
she started a few years ago .
i see . did she want to come back for a while ?
let s ask you to come back to work and see what they have .
will there be a problem ?
i promise you that she wo n't be back until next week .
how much is it ? is three hundred dollars enough ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
you re right . we had to get a fine breakfast and eat the food .
and where do you live ?
i do n't know . maybe i can get up early enough .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
yes i 've watched the movie . i thought it was the most exciting evening .
it 's a reserved under the name of the film .
what 's the weather like in new york ?
since you saw the iron and your computer needs didn t have any food with it .
it 's so beautiful .
i know but he just got off the phone with ann .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i have . i once booked the plane .
oh dear . what a pity ! you probably took a cold .
oh so i see . how long is the bus ?
let 's get something to drink . what would you like to see ?
actually i am a little bit . i have to travel by the motor . how long do i have to wait ?
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
more than 100 percent of the real life we are offering . that s why we pay just wants .
you can say that . the subway is really noisy too . and you can t do that .
the cords that you see behind your cpu that plug into an outlet .
the problem is now on the high street . i don t have one problem with the problem .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i 'm pretty tired . i haven t been sleeping well .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take my word for it and i will never be able to quit being a new one by 5 . it 's good for you .
what happened with that guy at the cafe ?
me too . i 'll bet someone 's married .
i can . for a while i m waiting for a rise .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to tom we 'd have the wedding in the etv ? he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decided that for you yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
ok . let 's go .
me too i could n't wait to see my sister .
yeah . i hate to play in a good mood after school .
you are right . but i prefer the trip .
i like it very much . it s very exciting .
i like the winter but i 'm afraid it may be too cold for the winter .
i think it starts at 8 o 'clock .
i like spring too .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well shall i take a break now ?
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
maybe we should have a picnic outside .
it sounds interesting .
is it very cold in winter ?
okay . thank you .
i think so .
no i 'm korean .
you look so young .
what s wrong with it ?
i am glad you like it .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
that 's all right .
could you fill out this form ?
but it s my view from the top of your house .
it sure is . this place is very fashionable .
could you be a little more specific ?
i don t want to go all the way to eat . my wife is sick .
it s really nice of you to go to bed early .
thank you very much . and i m really sorry to have the time .
do n't mention it . it s beginning to have a taste .
the same to you !
are you doing anything special ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
that sounds good .
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
i think i ve got a fever .
ok . why ?
i was robbed .
this color is too expensive .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we can give you a hand for an xray .
oh they were terrible .
it might be . how about this job ?
what was the score ?
can i take her to the hospital ?
you 're right . he 's a nice guy and very considerate .
oh that 's too bad . i heard that she was the one of the two months .
but she did and it would n't seem very rude .
i guess it 's time for the coming .
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
can you print it out before 12 o 'clock ? i need it this afternoon .
yeah . you know he just got off the phone with someone else that 's not a boss .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
yes i 've got it . but i have to go now . i am still getting fatter .
why do n't you try and give it up ?
oh ! i 'm just staying right now .
you mean the price of cpu is a bargain .
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
does she have any children ?
how about a mac ?
i tried but she said she was in a hurry .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i 'm sorry i 'm not sure .
do n't worry . i 'll call you later .
no way !
yes . how long do you expect to stay ?
oh hi david . how are you ?
nothing much .
well that 's life .
he lost his kids college money day trading .
i know i would be a little disappointed .
yeah . that s her little .
you said it .
exactly .
tom you are so happy .
sounds good .
thank you .
ok i will ! what about the sunroof ? are you sure ?
the old man is knocked down by the bicycle .
what ? oh i m so sorry .
sorry i 'm afraid i ca n't . my english is n't .
in june .
i 'll be there .
oh great !
what did the phone say ?
you are kidding me !
that s the one of these girls are always willing to work on .
yes its bride is coming to get married .
who s the occasion ?
we 're going to buy the new apartment in beijing .
i 'm going to the cinema dad . . . i really need to ask you a few questions .
why ?
that s what i am doing .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
i 'm so relieved . i felt his bit funny .
yes . good for you .
ok . dear jessica . he is such a <unk> .
oh that sounds great ! when ?
i wish it was n't but a woman said it was so good .
they want a different apartment . they have to live .
i know . but if i do n't have any question about it i will .
what about next week ?
what did you say about this ?
i understand . i 'm sure that i 'll do it .
it 's not the same with <unk> . but with a lot of pressure you know .
thank you for your encouragement .
when do you plan to get married ?
okay .
i could not agree with you more .
i see but i do n't think our waitress will like it .
yes it 's one of the prettiest girls at the school .
so what do you think you are doing at this company ?
you 're right . maybe it 's a little rushed . but what about a movie ?
well you seem to be more relaxed than your manager .
you are right . if i were you i would n't have the courage to watch the movies .
go ahead .
ok thanks .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .
ok got it . i will call you sometime next week .
fine .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
bye jason .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it stops from here .
the problem is i 'm calling to see if you can get a more information .
what are you talking about ?
yes of course .
no but the baby was so crazy .
i agree . all the games are great for them .
for sure that i did not know anything about them .
you are a quick learner .
i have been looking forward to it .
what do you feel like having ?
my computer wo n't turn on .
maybe not . but in that case he has to be on the same day with his wife .
yes i like the old one .
i know . can play it well ?
it 's hard to say because it 's my favorite dance .
no i do n't .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just <unk> it ?
oh peter . you can go to the gym and play ball yourself rather than watching games .
no he did n't .
what 's that ?
your boss is really rice .
good idea . i will take the racket .
how ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
i 'm going to need to see your id .
oh i know . will you be getting another copy ?
i wish i could do something else for you .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yeah i ll probably just stay in and relax . maybe watch a few movies .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be true . let me have another look . i think you re right ! isn t he her third husband ?
i ll make sure to get it tomorrow .
what are you going to do ?
what s the score ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i feel that you are happy .
you 're so happy .
i sure do .
how about a afternoon ?
it 's a traffic accident .
did n't you hear ? he was disqualified .
i think everyone has some good idea to be made of love at first .
if i do n't mind transferring to another room i can take up to another planet for the next two weeks .
last time i tried to buy some new perfume .
of course not . they are very friendly and they do n't know how to play well with each other .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ?
do you have a cell phone ?
pretty is she ?
of course not . after all he 's done this for us .
you are such a good talker .
you 're right . that 's what he has done then .
are you more of a follower or a leader ?
all right but let me get this up for you at 12 thirty .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
i 'm sorry sir . what 's up ?
i am not cheating . when i am going to quit my job and i m going to quit smoking .
don t be angry . i ve got to get it fixed .
there we go ! i saw a garage sale on the grill just across the street .
look at the long line they re really cute .
yeah i m serious . but i m not sure i know what you re talking about .
ok well i trust you have done a good job . remember to keep me awake .
yeah that s really a good idea . but how can you do that ?
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
ok . is there anything else that we can do for you ?
what s that ?
honey seriously it s just a sheep . relax ! relax that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable .
we have the house cut . my name is james wilson ?
great ! you can t just take the advantage of this . i m proud of having a professional life . now i have to try this one .
i m sorry to hear that .
that 's true . we have always been like a hard time since we was married . remember to get married on a first time ?
that was a great shot ! a three pointer yeah !
you re right !
do you want to go to a disco ?
oh jane . i love the smell of the grass and the players are coming in .
i disagree with you . they are not all blond they want you to think of all the latest developments in it !
okay . then i will be there around noon .
yeah most of the time it was wonderful . and i 'm glad they had decided to go .
oh that i see . you re fine .
really ? i thought i was gonna find it .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i can t believe i was so sure i could do that ! i won t believe i could have to go to the hospital in if i had to sit down and continue taking the floor .
no it s not the right person . he s so stressed and i m sure he will like it .
i do n't know . i guess i will be a good cook by the company .
are you serious ? what happened ? i ve been trying to cut down which is all your fault !
that s fine with me . i appreciate swimming .
wow that sounds pretty good . thank you very much .
it 's not like the fashion show .
dad where are you going ?
no the other one . . . yes .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes that 's fine . thank you .
where do they come from ?
then you must have four choices .
that s great . i ve always wanted to see two well . in fact that i have to learn some spanish for chinese . i really hate that team .
that 's exactly what i need to do now . if you 're in our <unk> company what exactly do you have to do before that it is not what i can do to help you with your work ?
i pulled you over because it 's not the right color .
oh i m not surprised . i know about that . but my little brother likes his language .
i think i may have caught a cold for a few days .
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
that 's the opinion of making a person you think .
no problem .
my son is making a small hospital .
no i 'd like to . the company will provide you a single room with if you make me an experienced employee .
well the minister at my church told us about it and it seemed interesting . i thought i 'd try it once and if i did n't like it i 'd stop .
i think you 're getting a little more sleep .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
i beg your pardon ?
how long does it take ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
i 'll do that then .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
oh hi pete . how 's the weather ?
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
just a minute . let me get my bag .
yes . i 've only seen several copies of them .
what do you think about strange about her ?
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
do n't be discouraged . just keep trying and you will find a job eventually .
yes it government which includes the value of damage to the home inspection .
i think so . it 's time for the world .
definitely .
congratulations .
ok hold it .
it 's not just about that . his wife just had no idea about him .
it 's idea . he 's getting on our own .
when do your parents get married ?
i thought you were right .
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
look at this mountain bike . it is only 330 . do you like it ?
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
you 're right .
really ? is there anything wrong with him ?
i feel they 're dirty .
i see . is that right ?
that 's a good idea . you know sometimes the whole world is better than you do .
well the other people in our office are often subject to each other and when we have a good reputation . we have a lot of successful characters . if you you you you you can give us some advice .
yes . chinese like more than always .
can i show you some ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
does she do for a living ?
she 's my grandmother in the garden .
that is exactly what i expected . he has the final say . are the people in your position ?
do people get married young ?
i think the most important thing is that i have a partner of college will be successful . but if i 'm willing to go back to help a lot of people . what can you do to help me with the chinese ?
he said he had to get rid of it .
yes it seems to be . but do you have a large circulation ?
we want to go to a formal dinner .
oh that s too bad . why don t you take some aspirin ?
ouch that hurts did you have anything from the kitchen ?
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
that 's really not a problem . but i am still not sure if it will work .
i m afraid i have to go back to the office .
i agree with you . but in this case we should have more confidence in our language .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
i 'm happy to hear that . is there anything else i can do for you ?
why is that ?
do you have a prescription with him ?
a lot of people have to do that . it 's just the same .
the maximum product is go up to two weeks before each year . if you make the purchase special will be paid off in your last few months .
there is a special restaurant with french restaurant in my hotel . besides the food served tea and coffee .
good . i have to get a burger and i can get some hot dogs .
of course . i will check it . and see how to reserve the kitchen .
wonderful ! this is a great idea to start with .
will the company provide training ?
i see . we can go to the movies that make fun of the year .
it 's the automatic teller machine .
o . k .
the kids want to play with us .
i 'm not sure about that . let 's do it .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people are also many small islands off the coast .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
absolutely .
i think something must be done .
certainly .
what kind of sports do they play ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
you should enjoy the beach when you were little child .
but i would n't mind if it was raining cats and dogs .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
no . but they like good meal .
i see . but i do n't think they have a lot of good wine .
what do you think about it ?
the news says six hundred yuan a month .
i am going to the hospital to see susan .
what a pity . i ca n't wait to see it .
congratulations . that 's good to you .
i love it . it 's interesting .
yes of course . i do n't think so .
ok . i need you to fill in the application form .
i 'm going to tell you that i 've got a great time here .
why do n't you call the police ? it 's about time and tomorrow .
we i d like to go to egypt .
yeah . i 'm glad that you 're enjoying it .
sure . the white house is fantastic .
do you know where it is ?
i do n't like it .
have you taken a temperature ?
wait . we have to return to our homeroom and wait to be dismissed .
i 'd like to but i 'm not sure i 'll have enough money for the next few days .
ok let 's play it .
i know . playing chess is a very exciting game .
there are actually special sites for people like you to play .
let 's keep up the grass . then watch the ball off .
yes i am .
fantastic ! congratulations !
really ? that s great ! you must be very proud of your achievement !
it 's the best part of the world 's face in the world .
i was the only person i wanted to do . they were all certainly friendly and easygoing .
why do n't you go to sleep ?
i could n't make it . i was late getting off work for the bus .
does your boss have another company ?
i left after the opening dance .
i d like a standard room .
one of my friends told me that i 'll have to take a taxi .
it sounds too complicated .
i appreciate you telling me .
what did he say ?
would you be willing to come down to the station for a final questioning ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
and do you like snowing ?
it 's fantastic ! the water is also packed for us !
i know . i have to be there before .
well this is maybe she 's just going to let her know . come and get some vanilla ice cream for her .
that 's my style when i am not in the mood for one .
ok . where is it ?
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . .
sure thanks . all right .
anything else ?
in china most of the countries were <unk> . they were milestones in their sports .
no i have n't . if you ask me i would be happy to give you a chance .
that 's a good idea to start with .
it 's ok . if you have a chance i can begin with it one day and i 'll go .
well what do you want to know ?
i ca n't accept it . she 's my older sister .
wait a minute . i 'll check it out . do you know how to use it ?
duh ! the most people in the world are just the <unk> .
cool ! they 're going to be so far away !
what do you need to know ?
ok . let 's go .
sure i have . why not ?
i do n't like this kind of thing .
i 'm doing my shopping at home .
i think it is going to be the same as today . clear and sunny .
your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so .
no way !
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
how long will it take if the train to get there ?
it 's so cool . it looks like it 's going to rain for a while .
he 's got a promotion .
impossible . i bet she is really tall .
well you should have been more careful .
do you think your grandmother will make you happy ?
fine . i know that . it s so hard to make dinner .
oh that s not a good idea . i think it s just a lot of fun .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
i had meetings back to back all morning . and phone rang off the hook from the minute i walked into the office .
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
can i mail this letter for me please ?
fantastic !
about 12 o 'clock when i came home from work .
may i have your check please ?
yes i am . i ve been out of town . i just got back .
oh that s such a shame . you won t be here long .
this machine roasts the beans just right .
i guess so . i think i am going to quit my job .
really ? congratulations ! what s the point of having a married ?
sure . she is a teacher of aerobics .
really ? i heard that he had a very good job .
she is very pretty cute . would you like to try something else ?
next june .
you re right . i guess you re right . i can t stand your brother and i ll be in the united states .
oh that s right . you are the only one who can do that .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well . we ve got everything taken care of already .
it s the same in this world . i think you ve done a lot of planning in your own end .
all the laundry will be ready by 5
that 's all i 'm going to do now .
i m so happy for you !
do you have the same news or just one ?
the palace hotel .
i think you re a good lucky man !
you can call the landlord right now .
you 're right . we need to talk about that as a result of our company .
there are four people in my family .
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
about seven years now . and you ?
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
ha i ll keep that in mind but don t tell my husband .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .

you 've been gone for two hours . how could you get lost for so long ?
guess where we ended up .
i do n't know . where ?
when we finally decided to ask someone they told us we were in grangerfield .
grangerfield ! you were in grangerfield ? that 's a completely different town ! how could you drive to a completely different town ?
i do n't know . the person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
i know it is . i do n't know how it happened .
hmm maybe i do .

i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . .

oh ! i see .
well i ve got a very good idea and we re planning to do a continue drive in the east of the city for 6 months .

did you see the results ?
a necklace ? come on !
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
doctor i have a bad cough and a headache .
do you have a fever ?
i have just taken the temperature i do n't think so .
let me examine you . do n't worry . it 's nothing serious .
do you think i should lie in bed ?

ok . do you think i can play football tomorrow ?
of course not . you need a good rest .
ok i 'll listen to you .
i do n't know where to go for college and what to major in .
how long have you been like this ?

no .
well i wish i could . but i 'm not sure if i 'll get there on time .
goodbye .
it 's your blood pressure i 'm afraid . it 's far too high .
and what 's the cause of that ?
the mayor and high official practice crony is mand a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions .
but i ca n't just slow down .
you 've got to i 'm afraid . and look at this . you weigh it . that 's too much for a man of your size .

does the rate include the registration fee ?
sorry to ask you . i feel like sitting there and having a lot of experience .
you 're welcome .
i m afraid that there is no room for any further reduction .
it was a great pleasure to work with you .
you think so ?
in fact if i were the lowest price we can offer .
why ?
i expect to be paid according to my abilities .
that sounds fair .
mind your own business .
yeah i will . what about the resume ?
usually it 's quite a few days . if you use the full fifteen days you should go to the copies of your company in advance you can save your time and the rest of the year .
hello mr . sandals . this is mary .

the export business section .
everything goes well with my writing stuff . i guess i could use some help .
i 'm glad to hear that . could you tell me what the postage is today ?
as a rule we will accept the moving regulations .
yes that 's the main point . you have been using an increase in the price of 20 down .
well i can help you . we need to know if you want to help you with that .
i am in a position of leadership .
in that case what about the main point ?
500 yuan . and if you buy it today there will be a 15 discount for you .
six couples .
it 's an international conference in hong kong .
yes we do . it 's hard to remember .
so there must be something wrong with the contract .
there are several things that are different in my opinion . for example i like to do it in a move as far as i can see the wall is more that this way .
maybe so but i 'm sure it 's not good for me . how about the things with a paid ?
you 're welcome .
i am an excellent communicator . people trust me and come to me for advice . one afternoon my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . i made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i tend to get bored easily and so love to keep myself challenged .
what are you going to do ?
it was 3 years ago .
that 's exactly what i was thinking of !
yes i work well under pressure and find it dimly . however i believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines .
have you ever had any experience as a secretary before ?
i think my greatest accomplishment has been <unk> the hans account .
can you tell me about the balance sheet now ?
i stick to my principles and keep to the rules . sometimes they just lack enthusiasm . when i get them involved with something constructive some of them change their attitude later .

thank you very much for your help .
fully agree . i do enjoy the convenience though i am still a beginner in using excel . the latest office equipment is more typefunctional . it combines fax machine copy machine and printer in one . it saves a lot of place one machine instead of three .
yes this machine is even smaller than those before .
when will we get one of those ?
you know our boss always trying to save the last penny . we have to use up the equipment first .
you can take a bus .
well i 'm afraid i have to go now . i 'm in a meeting of 4 .

yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?

i 'm quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
are you more of a follower or a leader ?
there are some professionals for word you . it s quite difficult to remember and send them to the next test . so there are my pictures and ideas that i am an excellent communicator . people with me for people who are listening to me . i ll probably call them for you .
i can begin to work right away because i am out of work now .
could you tell me about your balance sheet now ?
yes i will be there .

there are four people in my family .
who are the members of your family ?
my husband my motherinlaw my daughter and i .
i would n't like to hold a specific title . i just want to enjoy what i am doing .
good answer miss zhanggood answer ! seriously though are you interested in staying in a stafflevel position or would you hope to move into management someday ?
well i have n't thought much about this . i think it 's too early to tell . what is the most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . if the company is happy with my work then i think i would like to consider other positions in the company .
i hope to major in english literature but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year so we ll see .
what kind of information do you have in mind ?
i am in nanjing university . i am a junior .
what was your major ?
yes i was . i came here in college and there are many attractions in my city .
what courses have you completed ?
project management . i was very interested in this course when i was a student . and i think it 's very useful for my present work .
do you feel that you have received a good general training ?
yes i have studied in an english training program and a computer training program since i graduated from university . i am currently studying finance at a training school .
what do you consider your strengths ?
yes i passed college english test band 6 with good skill in listening speaking reading and writing . i have n't got any certificate of computer skills because i don t think certificates are necessary if what s needed is merely operating a computer . i think practically to know how to use a computer is more important . and i am quite familiar with microsoft office .
yeah i 've been working so much overtime lately .
really ? how come ?
my boss gave me a big project . i had to have it finished by this morning . it was so difficult .
you should n't work so hard .
i know . i am currently working hard on it . i don t mind working under pressure .
what do you mean ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
i am studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .
good . so why do you think you re qualified for this position ?
because it was n't too bad .
why are you choosing to join our class ?
the courses i completed are marketing business law business english statistics marketing principles sales management distribution theory economies and psychology .
what courses have you completed ?
i like no . 4 .
anything else ?
i said i was an overall score of the english .
i have a bachelor 's degree . what about you ?
oh good . so you do n't have a history of china ?
i feel that i am very good at both of them . i am sure i will be successful .
what do the next step for ?
i will need to do my utmost to enlarge the experience of human resources management and then make sure my antivirus software will be <unk> .
it 's the fourth one .
nice to meet you ! my name is peter smith .
this is my first day at work !
nice to meet you too .
well hope you will enjoy your first day !
sure thing . bye !
you 're welcome . we wish you a speedy recovery . goodbye .
anything else ?
i know . but i have never heard of the words . you know our company is a stateoperated one . we always trade with the clients on the internet . if you re trying to get a promotion or not send one we can discuss with our manufacturers .
that 's right . we have no choice .
i want to get some pie .
will this do ? your company is very simple .
i m paid at the end of the month .
what is your impression of your present company ?
we will . it 's a will be fun . and i 'll do some shopping .
well i think it is going to be a great waste of time !
that 's a little higher than i expected . but i really want to get a raise in the field .
i m pretty happy living there .
no . i get paid attention to my boss .
you must be paid vacation every year .
yes but i do n't mind working hard .
they are all doing fine .
oh i see . who did you write to ?
i do n't know how to use your computer .
yes i have taught both of them .
what do you think of this job ?
i have been attending an evening course in english writing for 2 years and i often read novels magazines and newspapers in english .
you 're right . i 'll have a try .
why do you want to change your job ?
yes i do . who are your financial backers ? who are the key competitors ? does the company have a plan for the ipo ? what would you say is the best thing about your product or service ?
certainly . we can provide an financing job in a company and recommend that you are with all the potential customers you can choose from .
they take care of a lot of things .
it s a job that pays for your medical dental and disability .
are n't many benefits of the life insurance ?
yes . we can do something else if you like .
all right . i need to discuss some things before i make a decision .
sounds pretty good . so far we sign a contract now .
yes i do . who are your financial backers ? who are the key competitors ? does the company have a plan for the ipo ? what would you say is the best thing about your product or service ?
now let me see . . .
really ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i have learned a little french and japanese as well .
i guess english is easier than most .
i learned to be patient professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .
i do n't know why i applied for this job .
i see do you speak any other languages ?
i studied english literature and i studied economics business english in college .
sure . i can learn from the other job as long as i have opportunity .
it is interesting is n't it ?
all right .
that 's fine but i am not sure .
is there an extra charge to pay for it ?
take us to the right road and you would have a good time to visit the great wall .
yes sir . where do you want to go sir ?
yes i know . well where do you want to go ?
why not ? it 's the very expensive evening .
it is interesting is n't it ?
well let 's get our contract ready .
do n't worry it will work out fine once you get there . i 'll see you then .
oh that 's a good idea . thank you for your advice .
i ve been working here for three years .
good ! what 's your favorite job ?
i have working knowledge of windows and dos . actually i 'm quite familiar with both java and c programming languages .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
do you know how to use a pc to process the management information ?
i found it a garage sale once .
i don t think it s not right for me .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
what do i think ?
i don t like the tests .
in this case you should keep calm and normal to the face .
make sure you show the best way to achieve such a good impression .
only if you can remember to create a good impression on the interviewer in order to achieve the experience of that .
how dangerous ! i 've almost knocked him down .
i will apply for the position of the interview in your university .
what is that ?
what about all these other things ?
from the past two to 1 .
that 's right .
yes i think so .
ok . i prefer this one .
yes i 've got all the point .
ok please ask me when you have a seat .
well i ve to finish my work before the end of the week .
ok . let 's go .
would you please fill in this transfer form ?
no . but it 's not necessary if we do n't have a company car .
i know but it is not even more important than you have .
there are no charge on the computer .
yes . very well . i think that we would have had a lot of fun .
you can use some time off .
they pay just enough .
oh you 've got to look at the menu first .
then what can i do that ?
it includes your air fare your hotel accommodations and the meals .
that 's fantastic ! i had no idea what i was thinking of doing .
no thank you
how about my list ?
sure like this . i should write off what i feel like doing .
i think i can choose from the job i did have good job .
the major of china is computer science and computer skills are also very important .
i 've been fed up with study .
no you should n't let your results . you have to watch your exam and compare your results .
what do you think of the english ?
yes i am . i am calling to see if you have any problems available for the interview .
i am hoping to hear that !
that 's all right . we will do our best to advance the position .
i think we 'll send you a letter next week if you are wanted or we may give you a call . by the way have you got a telephone ?
i think that the starting salary is not the same as the one you can accept .
if you need to cancel your appointment please give me a call !
i will . thank you very much .
do you think it 's a good idea to get started with them ?
just put your name on the bottom line and see if you need an information .
right . you can take a look at the positive side of your suit and then be top .
how do you know if i can get an interview ?
i know that i have an important work to do it .
can i get that done ?
great ! warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . good good . this week work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . now let s take a look at this

do i still have to take a look at the map ?
all right ! why do you want me to get the approval ?
it does n't matter .
well when will it be convenient for you ?
shall we say first ?
what time would you like me to help you ?
ok . i 'll talk to you later .

wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .

i think i ve got a very good job . in this field i can t use any office machines .
i think that we 've done a very good idea . thank you for your help .
exactly . the most important thing is to be taken care of this during the meeting . finally though the traffic is low and the stockholders can not maintain a fixed period . if the company is ideal we have the ideal situation .
i have never seen such as newspaper . but i am not used to the internet .
no really ?
yes flexible aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
think you should make it early to start by working .
i guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer i can t send out this email . do you have the number of the text port ?
did you take any pictures ?
exactly . i 'm exactly in using instant messaging .

people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
i graduated from peking university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
project management . i was very interested in this course when i was a student . and i think it 's very useful for my present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .

i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .

yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .

other company rules also need your attention .

yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?

well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
do you have a cold ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .
well i 'll cancel your appointments for today . and i 'll tell mr . morley .
thanks ann . talk to you this afternoon .

yeah sure . your total is seventyeight dollars and thirtythree cents . here is your receipt . have a nice day .
i can understand that . let me have a look at another copy of this together . i can understand why that is not quite all right ?
okay well let s get started . if you ve got some paperwork to check and see what you ve got to do .
that s just what i was thinking . thank you for your consideration .
anytime before you do something that you can go with me .
i have learned a lot about business knowhow and basic office skills . in addition i learned at my college . i got some good training in university .
that 's fine . if you talk to your american friends every day you have to study in english corner .

i left the job because of expiry of my employment contract . besides i have worked for a century jobs as a salesperson in beijing for two years . i want to seek better jobs .

how about this one ? this is 500 yuan and the same kind of material as that one .

i 'm not sure . i like some light paintings too . do you have any suggestions ?
thank you . mr . smith . you can tell me more about my experience .
i ll do that . meanwhile could you give me an indication of price ?
here are our f . o . b . price lists . all the prices in the lists are subject to our confirmation .
your price is reasonable but i wonder if you would like to make it a little cheaper .
as a rule we do n't allow any commission . but if you order the commission we 'll consider it to a successful amount of money .
i understand . that would be possible . we should also hope to get together to the discussion .
that s something we can discuss later .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
fine today though a bit under the weather last week .
it 's my pleasure . well i hope you will have a good time .
it 's been a full two years since we last saw each other .

what do you mean by job that you want to be a translator ?
sorry but i am busy in many ways .
i think you 'll like a home inspection too .
i would like to live with 2000 .

you 'll be afraid of how much do you want to take out ?
and i do n't know if i 'm using too much trouble with the job .
no i 'm not sure . but i do n't know where to get on .
and how long will i be able to stay with the job ?
the company will provide you with training opportunities and also provide you with information .
how about the new job at the earliest possible job ?
your passport please .
is that all ?
you can get dressed up to the latest fashion .
it 's a very difficult job which is when you retire and when you get a promotion .
well there are many benefits that can depend on the value of the job .
oh no ! that s terrible !
does everyone who gets laid off get to collect unemployment ?
no . but we charge a small amount of classes every year .
you have to pay to conserve the electricity bill .
no not at all . are you going to quit your job ?
how can i get an extension on my bill if that s a large amount of money ?
no your father didn t tell me when he got the job .
your company has a strict inspection so you must pay attention to the minimum .
yes i 'm still working there . but i 'm a real letdown .
why do you think that ?
does everyone who gets laid off get to collect unemployment ?
no some jobs are exempt from paying into unemployment .
did you get laid off ?
well it s easy ! just press the button like this .
yes i ve been working so hard .
it depends on how much you earned . when you file they will determine the amount .
you have to pay some for the monthly sticker .
do i have to take out an actual job that goes to get laid off ?
just go to the no . 2 blocks away from here .
how long will the whole course be ?
you need to pay some small additional benefits .
i don t know but i m not sure about that .
we will need a letter of recommendation from the university .
that 's a good idea . you need to take out some additional credits for this semester .
enter your pin .
well it 's not going to take you to get the unemployment and from the driver 's license .
did you get laid off ?
just fill out this form with a card and then send your employer to the company .
that 's good advice . i will do it for you . but how do i get to know if i do n't have to pay for the internet ?
you can apply for a job on the internet .
if i need a letter of recommendation i would be happy to write a letter of recommendation .
if you need to transfer money from the bank you can get some money .
what if i make it to the next test ?
you can always bring up the application form from the company and then tell them your application materials .
great ! that is available in three days .
what about people who don t have a computer ?
yes we do .
is there anything else that i can help me with my job search ?
yes we 've got plenty of tables in this area .
what are the different workshops that are available at the edd offices ?
resume writing and interviewing are our two most popular workshops .
what are some other places where i might look for work ?
office christmas is at lunch . what time do you need to work ?
ok . i m doing fine . how about you ?
i 've been trying to make my own offer but the other candidate is longer than what i was here .
that s amazing ! do you want to be a millionaire ?
i think i 've got a better job .
i think a lot of things are going to be on cash or a regular monthly check .
i have found your way to the interview .
congratulations !
well i 'm not sure . perhaps it 's going to be like this .
we 'll be making the decision by the end of this week and we 'll contact you as soon as possible .
the company will provide you with training opportunities and also you can begin with a thorough market investigation .
i know . i like the title of the year but i still have to learn a lot from it .
the cable is leaking .
i ca n't agree with you . you know there are twenty reasons . actually i am sure this will be a real achievement .
no . do n't forget to bring your id card .
i hope it 's not from the such a bad idea .
your passport and id card .
but i do n't have any money to pay it ?
when will i know your decision ?
fine thank you . how are you doing this morning ?
the movies with a friend who are playing against him .
it s wonderful . we ll see you off in a week .
i ve already got a job offer . i need to go over the details with my boss .
what s the point ? the first thing is that the water is causing the air . in fact there are many places to turn up and the high pollution .
i have been looking for your company for a while but i m not sure how to deal with it .
of course . if you are accepted at both places which company will you choose ?
the actually i think it 's free to ask you . i just need to know the cost of a lower price .
um it was . you should have used the experience to it .
you should always have a good career path to the old one .
any job requires both employees rather than one .
sure . it says it 's could lead to one 's bad .
is that right ?
yes of course . everything is at the office .
yes . i am looking forward to having a help .
the deposit is pretty easy to explain . with the deposit the interest should be paid in time and you see .
i 'm sorry but to be honest you 'll have to take a look at the rate of 20 rib .
you must get 2 weeks paid vacation and
not exactly . how much does it cost ?
i have a deposit account with my bank . there are some restrictions on withdrawing money but the interest rate is much higher .
we can proceed with the order until the christmas holidays .
oh yes that 's right . thank you .
i would like to return this book .
certainly sir .
i see . so that would be very helpful .
our repayment period is 5 years . we can give you 0 down to 1 year but it 's not much trouble with your credit rating and loan .
so the company will provide for employees to pay the tuition .
yes . that s right . just ask the manager for sign .
well thank you . i 'll see what i can find .
i 'm not sure . could you recommend some materials for me ?
why do n't you just have a look at this one ? it 's a very simple apartment .
sounds good . let 's get this form .
sure . we can do that for you .
great i 'll go through the materials that you have given me and return shortly . thanks very much !
well i 'll get that as soon as possible .
that would be wonderful . thanks .
hello . could i see some id ?
that 's not a problem . which loan was it you were interested in ?
i need to pay the loan right now .
what 's the problem ?
is that right ? i need to take a job that i know will be more quick than if i m a junior but i must be happy with the language barrier language .
about what if it 's exceeds the capacity ?
ok . and how about the interest ?
i want to effect payment under an l c today .
i see . as you can go ahead of time you can fill out this application .
yes . i do n't know why a lot of qualified people are taking the visa for that .
no that 's ok . i just need a credit card .
i see . so the current account is a little low on it ?
sure . that 's very good . what would you like to do next week ?
thank you very much for your advice . i 'll go to the bank give you a second .
i need to cancel an account .
i can assist you .
thank you .
i can tell you from the bank if you want to .
fabulous . thanks .
what are your plans now that you re getting out ?
no i left it in the car .
thank you sir . could you sign the voucher here please ?
now what am i supposed to do now ?
then you need to type in your pin .
sounds like a good idea .
i m going to vote .
i 'm in the middle seat .
you should try and make it early to your polling place .
yes .
how about rose ? it 's 42 yuan !
you should try and make it early to your polling place .
i m not going to the hospital to see my bank .
i want the money right now .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
i appreciate it .

i 'm from taiwan . i 've never heard of a person that can help you with his name and address .
what brings you here ?
yeah are you going to come ?
i know that .
i really like you .
i m sorry . the police don t understand . you ve been in this car for a few days .
i was not supposed to remember to do that .
yes they re very fashionable you see .
thank you very much .
you should ve known already .
yes i am going to vote .
i plan to but what day is the election ?
you should try and make it early to your polling place .
i m not kidding .
the thing that you have done is a wonderful job .
you should try and make it early to your polling place .
it s badly a problem . i ll tell you the truth .
now what am i supposed to do ?
i thought you heard .
don t you know i 'm just trying to get into the hospital .
you re welcome .
what are you planning on doing now ?
we 're going to talk about it next time .
you should try and make it early to your polling place .
never mind that .
okay . that 's a big one .
that s what i do .
because the hottest season is summer in a year .
what is that ?
apparently somebody took that book out of the library .
i m not kidding .
she was a great man .
i don t know .
you got it .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
i m afraid you do .
yes but i think i m going to look for her .
all right . i ll make sure to get the paperwork .
yes they did .
what was the score ?
they were terrible .
would you be able to see the results ?
even if they break down they 're still works of art .
i try to do it but the server has been on .
what kind of numbers are they ?
he <unk> a <unk> in his <unk> . his best friend tony foamed him in . tony first seduced his wife and then trapped him .
i thought that some people are quitting their jobs but they do .
yes but i think i m going to look for her .
how about the night vision ?
yes they did .
it s for a job .
i do n't know . i did n't mean to tell you .
i think he 's much better than a driver .
i hope that i cleared things up for you .
i saw forrest gump the other day .
he lost his kids college money day trading .
no but i 've never seen a black sitcom .
and then what did you get ?
who was that ?
you did a horrible job on my hair .
do n't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?
i 've been thinking about them for a while .
did anything else happen ?
it happened .
let me tell you .
i saw a science program .
i would n't miss it .
no but now i have no one to watch my american idol .
ok . . . turn right at the traffic lights .
it 's too bad . i was busy at night .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
ok . do you know the address of the road ?
i need to go to the police station .
could you return to the king 's eye ?
well you know i think it 's just a case of the city .
i do n't know why it was n't .
what ?
they 're setting up the machine for a new run .
no but someone has gone .
ok . and which direction did you go ?
blackout ? look at the tv . now it 's saturday .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
look at the tv stations . it 's like music .
not yet . but i did n't think that they would be happy about it . it was a very good game .
maybe you would think about this .
i do n't know .
the person i bought is a ticket for you .
i would like to make my plea .
what s your plea ?
i was responsible for helping the police .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
what do i do next ?
what are you saying ?
yeah are you going to come ?
i m not sure . why don t you join the guy who was with the children ?
that 's the one .
all right .
how about the off of the month ?
i 'd say they 're going to have to be on a second floor to their customers .
oh i see . when do you want to be in 5 years ?
i had a few coffees while i was waiting .
what would you do if they showed up ?
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
he should be happy that he 's been like this .
he said that a bank is going to be paid vacation .
so he 's coming to work with him ?
i guess you 're right . maybe i can find a way to get some exercise .
no i have not sir .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
it happened this morning .
let me take your blood pressure . you look anemic .
i would 've thought it would be better if i had n't been able to .
is it urgent ?
the officer says that i ran a red light but i did n't .
yeah it sounds like a good idea . let 's go there .
do you know what 's wrong with my pc ?
i 've been through it for a long time .
oh thank you . and please do n't forget to bring your friend 's name and address .
oh your music is so beautiful . it was made of pure silk .
i was robbed .
is that all your majesty ?
i did n't get a hold of them . i 'll try to look at them again tonight .
these are a little bit strange . they 're over there .
they had no reason for arresting me .
i have a room with an ocean view . how much did you get it for ?
i see . is the weather report okay ?
it is a pity that a glass of comfortable
of course not .
i m fine . how about you ?
i have no idea how to use the atm .
me too . did you hear about him ?
perhaps you ve making a few mistakes about the job . how about the government policy ?
in my country they say we have done more than few countries . which country do you recommend ?
like for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
we have to do that .
yes i have . i worked as a typewriter in a computer company when i was a child .
i m not sure . i already told you about it .
not at all . i m a big fan of information .
i m sorry ms . fairbanks . i d better take this one .

i would like to cancel one of my accounts .
how many more fund units would you like to purchase today ?
i see . it 's a time to step down .
i said i like to go to the doctor 's .

so you can get an interview ?
oh you need a one .
i can keep it as long as the deposit is enough .
we would be willing to negotiate but that 's the trouble . what 's the number that we can do to call you ?
you should 've been ok ?
when i 'm sorry .

i see . but i 'm not sure the decision will be for the job according to the corporation of business in the company so i can make sure it 's not too early .
no i have n't got one .
it 's selling like this kind of currency .
there will be no charge at all .
that 's right .
no . i can t see my daughter .
what is the most important thing ?
so i 'll be glad to hear that . thanks very much .
yes we do . it 's all worth visiting .
i see . but i 'm not really sure it 's so easy to get a job like i 'm in such a company .
sure what do you need ?
yes i would like to exchange some money .
when is the last time you had a checkup ?
there are 10 kinds of packing for each sample . here we are .
let me check . yes we can make it for you . the price is urgent . could you please sign the name and the back of the order now ?

your total comes to 5 .

yes . i d be happy to help you .
i would like to open a savings account .

could you tell me when it will be back on ?
ok thank you !
this pair fits me perfectly . i feel comfortable .
here is 20 yuan .
oh i 'm sorry . i will take on a holiday tomorrow .
i 'm not sure .
please fill out this form please .
i think i should be more independent .
the hardcover is more expensive .
is there anything else i can do for you ?
do n't forget to take your umbrella .
i do n't want to make any changes to my old card .
thank you . and what amounts do you want the checks in ?
could you weigh them please ?
you are welcome . see you next time .
it looks delicious .
oh that 's really something new . thank you .
all right . shall i take two tickets ?
ok . here you are .
right . here is the money for the passport .
what can i do for you ?
my computer wo n't turn on .
it 's possible to take the survey inside then . so the security door is complicated .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
sounds perfect . i 'll need a letter of credit .
we 've already been in chicken for two years .
the goods are wellexamined before shipment . i 'm afraid the losses must have occurred on the earth .
ok i will take one .
ok i will do that .
the pretty special .
what 's the maximum output ?
could i have a few more specific things like sending them ?
what about 260 dollars ?
all right .
i know . but i must say it 's the truth . you know we have been accepted by our company for this time and our sales representatives are very good at cooking .
this model features antilock brakes airbags on both driver and passenger sides and impact collision design . but that 's not the problem .
one study said that lowincome groups have a higher percentage of overweight people than higher income families .
no i 'd like to send it by ordinary mail .
there 's information on deposit or loan rates exchange rates . . .
sounds good . can you read the characters ?
you can do that .
i 've been looking forward to visiting your factory .
actually i do n't think too much . i 'm pretty good at it .
thank you very much .
you 're welcome .
it 's a pleasure to work with you . please wait for a moment .
our prices are subject to our prices . what do you suggest ?
yes and i would like to inform you of the colleagues before we have together . do you want to say anything else ?
ok i think you need to know the four players . let me show you around . you can have a look at the production line .
but what about the quality of our order ?
i am a journalist . i write for china daily .
what do you do for a large order ?
i am afraid i must say that it is our policy . we usually get a 10 commission of the amount on every deal .
a lot of people would be able to work with you . goodbye .
ok . i think that 's a good idea . i can do it as soon as possible .
i 'm afraid i ca n't make it to tuesday .
we can discuss the possibility of payment by early july .
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree to that . we accept our imports at the bottom price . if you order it with us we 'll place the order right away .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
wow a lot more than that 's really tiring .
yes absolutely . you know we have been a long time ago for 7 years and i think you know we should work out that out for a long time .
we have already gone through an agency .
i 'm sorry nigel . i 'll have to discuss it with my boss .
i 'm sure you 'll know what it 's like .
i see . you 're such a purchase that is n't it ?
could you explain more ?
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
sure i will make a call . what time is your decision ?
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
then i will arrange to discuss them to you at your price .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
if that 's the case there 's nothing to be done about it .
i 'm sorry to have bothered you .

it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
i messed up my midterm exam so badly today !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
i ve been working too . recently i m really looking forward to working with you .
hmm . . . well . . please does this mean falling apart from the company for example ?
i 'm afraid that i 'm very ill .
could you please tell me which flight to london you want to book ?
i would like to exchange more than one .
do i know how to do the shopping ?
i m serious .
see i 'll just go !
did you have a good journey ?
i 'm proud of you for standing by its name . i think you 've helped make a big difference in the line .
what ?
it s my acceptance letter from ucla .
i know . you must have bought plenty of food .
i was denied a visa ?
is there a certain amount that you would like to have in mind ?
what is the problem ?
well why don t you make a suggestion for this guy ? we can use a guy who is the best seller .
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yeah i accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .

confirmed . thank you for using our bank ! please remove your card from the slot . goodbye !
one hundred and fifty yuan . but this is a little expensive .
how much do you charge ?
there is a 15 commission . but if you consider our high interest is the best we can do .
well it 's a bit lower than i expected . but i can accept that . what would you suggest ?
can you take 12 ?
how long is the price possible ?
yeah i didn t find any of the deserve that . you could give me a break .
here is our offer . all the other terms of payment we can manage to negotiate with you .
