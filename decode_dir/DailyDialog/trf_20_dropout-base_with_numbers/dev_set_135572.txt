they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .

sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?

i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .

you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .

just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
are you looking to help me ?

how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?

do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
we are in the ads today .

well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .

chinese dishes are exquisitely prepared delicious and very <unk> .

all the dishes are green tea .
i like your wife .

well i have n't been to the theater in a long time .
sorry but he 's busy then too .

i think we should take a taxi .
i think that s a very good idea . i m sure he will .
i think that 's a bit important do n't you think ?
let s go to a store and buy some soft drink .
yes .
are you a hurry ?
the end of the world ?

i like a house and i like to be independent .

3 yuan .
here is ten yuan .
it is at the north of forbidden city on the central axis of beijing .
you are going to look so beautiful today . do you want to go to sleep ?
that comes to four dollars and ten cents .
can i help you with something ?
thank you .
hi .
yeah ?
thank you . where should i send your final phone bill ?
yes i 'm from the airport .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
okay but i have to finish the report first thing i can do .
see you then .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
i m glad to hear that .
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you you you you you you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello steven !
wow you 're going to be in a nice evening mary .
it was almost an hour ago .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
well that 's great news .
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
ok i will . if you do n't mind i 'll call you later .
thank you very much .
do n't you hit it off ?
i began to went there last month .
right .
she 's pretty outgoing i think . but i 've ever seen one of them in the same way .
what is your strongest trait ?
yeah a lot of the same nowadays is almost here .
he must be a politician . he likes to dance music .
what happened ?
thank you .
i can take it . besides i need a lot of money and i need to exchange some from my account .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
i think so ! about the traffic coming down this road and you ll have to bring your car .
what are you talking about ?
yeah ! i think we ve got a lot of time to do this !
what 's the blood pressure ?
we ve got a lot of time ! does it hurt ?
just relax . i 'll just check .
some of my friends play cards on the internet . have you ever tried that ?
there are other ways to quit . you can try the nicotine patch or nicotine chewing gum . we spend a fortune on it .
i m looking for a sweater .
are you looking for a small size ?
i might need a few minutes . i ll also have a look at that scarf .
what s your camera ?
no problem . the certificate has been considering introducing our customers to companies in the original condition and that has a claim for most of the countries .
do you have a seat ?
thank you very much .
so how much do you live in the city ?
it is nice too . how much is it ?
i d like to buy one . they have an inexpensive camera .
any necklace ?
i don t think that s a lot of money .
how much is it <unk> ?
i 'm not very sure . but i like this one .
luckily we have a high fever .
that s right !
thanks for saying so .
have you forgotten the cheers ?
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
is this salami and bologna you have here ?
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll speak to bob he 'll be able to help us .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes .
no way ! i m really sorry !
great ! could you come back in a little later ?
this song is beautiful but i will never tell anyone else . it will work . you can do it in the library .
great i ll come in tomorrow .
it could be as little as 2 dollars or as much as 10 dollars more per square yard .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
what size are you ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's no hot water after 10 at night . sometimes i like to have a hot shower before bed . especially in the winter . it feels good .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
the stove is brand new .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
three bedrooms and a big kitchen . there s so much rent for one .
i have n't thought of that .
yes it has two bedrooms . that 's convenient .
it s nice to meet you too .
the rent is 1050 every month .
that s way too much .
well . you re welcome on friday .
i work in the bank every year .
let me see . that s no problem .
it s really not your problem .
can i see the student bus to get the ticket ?
okay . i go to bed on friday .
i am afraid not .
yes . i like cooking very much . i got this hobby when i was 12 years sold .
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah the food is so easy . i never knew chinese food was the best . i would never eat spicy food when i was in the supermarket .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
are you sure he will like your suit ?
i 'll take one .
the compact ? why do you think that one is better than the others ?
you might also want to tell the best price in the market .
it s still a big problem for me . i ll come to your bedroom and a garden for you .
hey i just played basketball earlier so my legs are a little sore . let s go to work .
i see . but if you wear this color and your shirt it s not that big .
they 're fine . can i have a black one ?
the first interview is a little bit low . so you can do it anywhere by then .
the bigger the better .
yes it will be a worthwhile read .
i ve brought the same rooms and those are ordinary flowers .
this is he . how can i help you ?
i was wondering if there 's a problem with your company .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i am happy to hear that .
i love it . all you know is one of the bedroom and a nice room .
good . i will see you then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
there 's a great pity !
right .
should i bring anything with me ?
we can check your oil and snacks but if you want to bring some foldup chairs for people if you need to see the available person .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
oh i see . i remember the price of yours .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it has .
the area can be quite large .
i know .
with so few windows how can you even see what the problems are ?
okay . you have a look at the dark clouds . it 's very quiet and beautiful .
it s great . i really wanted to see it with me .
the best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom .
i especially like the design .
five . besides live alone and one kid .
it is ! look at these little light ? they are very cheap .
it looks like it s about time . you can t just leave me alone !
in the meantime you must be very careful about the long run .
how can i know what you mean .
well i have a guest pass . where 's it made ?
wow ! that sounds great !
i thought it might rain .
thank you . that 's a very nice day .
that s what i was looking for .
this is he . what can i do for you ?
hello i am calling to see if you have a vacant apartment . may i ask what you need ?
do you see it ?
i 'd like to but i 'm not sure if it 's still too expensive for me .
i will show you the perfect house .
i have no problem with 6 p . m .
maybe you can come to the station tomorrow morning .
ok . see you then .
we have a deal with people .
should i make an appointment with me ?
no but if you like to check out before we can get it for you .
yes . i am a bit confused . my sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called sociology and the modern age . according to the syllabus the book is in the library but i have n't been able to find it .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
okay thanks for your help .
yes .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
oh i 'm from taiwan .
i 'm sure you 'll like fisherman's wharf . it 's a popular tourist spot . be sure to try the seafood there .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
do you know how short you want your hair to be ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
i 'd like to see it mr . smith .
cut it out please .
how about some coffee ?
no problem . i think it 's a little tight in the waist .
what style do you want ?

i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
i do n't need a car . i walk to work .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .

what 's playing at the century fox ?
oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
there are several interesting places you can choose from .
you 're kidding . that 's the heart of lake . you 've heard that people 's a crush on their own .
no it is not far .
oh i 'm shocked .
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i am worried .
what about ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
oh is that all ?
i feel very nervous about it .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i suppose i 'm going to get a ba in english .
i understand . when you find something wrong with the job you are already changing it .
do you have any plans for a whole week ?
i remember a case that was filled with obstacles . the first thing i did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . i assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . i was able to get some input from another lawyer i happened to see at lunch . through some hard work and fact digging i was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles .
what ? what do you mean ?
i agree with you on the point but i think it s time to stop .
what do you mean ?
that s okay i am going to do some more research into this restaurant . thanks for your help .
i think you re right . i like that idea but i don t want to be the only one i m afraid .
ok .
great . thanks .
what can i do for you today ?
i need to transfer money .
what 's the problem ?
do you know how to turn them on ?
did you check the periodicals ?
i didn t even bother to think of that .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
i see .
sure . i prefer you to find a parttime job search for a more off at the same time .
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
ah ! this is the kind of thing i 've never had before . it seems like an idiot !
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
did you go to the top of the eiffel tower .
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to cancel one of my accounts .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
great . can i take it with me now ? or do you need me to fill in some forms or something ?
how much is the late fee ?
yes .

i 'll see what i have got . what do you want me to do ?
yes i do .
can you tell me something about the classes you want for the first course ?
wise decision . that is 400 yuan . you 'll find it 's totally worth it .
i 'll be free from two until four o 'clock .
nothing . i think i 'll do the best . it 's always a pity if i can go to a game with the flu . i think it 's a great feeling to be all in the land .
fine . what time would you like to meet ?
we are at 2368 king street east .
when you cross the quad the office is right in front of you . go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .

i was a student . what about you ?
do n't forget to take the test again . i can practice every day and get back to you .

i want to know about the company on the internet .

i do n't think she will do such a thing .
that would be great .
maybe you are right . well i think we should do something different .
but i like its color .
anyway it 's my ideal coat . i 'll take it .
i 'll take one too .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .

do you hate fighting the crowds on the weekends ?
oh i see . do you live near the station ?
do you need help with something ?
i am not sure what i can do .
well i ve been feeling pretty serious . i ve been thinking about going out for the past few days . .
the prices are good but you know it 's so small .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
nothing . i am just not in the mood these days .
i was almost off my head .
wonderful . what s the problem ?
all right . and how much are they ?
you know that i care for you .
why do n't you wear purple one ?
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
thanks .
really ? what will i do if i am not into a football match ?
excuse me miss . what 's the tour time we have ?
that s fine .
i think you 'll like it .
i 'll see you soon .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
eh so so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
what s the weather report ?
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and forget and forget and forget and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
did you hear about the cost of living room ?
thanks for saying so !
what do you think so ?
anyway i think i are the best choice for a doctor .
well this one looks rather big . perhaps you need to get a brain surgery .
come on nancy . i 'm your a very serious person . but after all i do n't want to put this up with you .
are you kidding me ? it is always hard to have a good time in my country .
but i want to make myself more money .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
we 're going to visit my sister in the city .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
the water will not drain .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know that . i 've brought some bad clothes with me to make sure they are healthy .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you think that many people <unk> their own kids ?
i have n't seen you for ages .
it s from nyu .
well i was thinking of it ! i won a prize for best local companies at the annual sales contest .
i really did n't know that . . . you were really a happy woman !
i think i 'm lucky .
i think i 'm your lucky fellow .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
thanks for coming .
when are you off ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
take care of yourself and do n't forget to keep in touch .
goodbye . hope to see you again next year .
i was wondering if you wanted to go for a walk with us .
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .

i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
goodbye . see you again sometime .
i 'm just jealous of you . i do n't know what 's wrong with it .
it 's as plain as he looks . but it 's already occupied .
how ay ! the roses are !
well you can bet this relationship 's going to be a flash in the pan .
it must have been love at first sight because i know he 's got a girlfriend last week .
i think you are absolutely right . actually my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . they got married a month later .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i do n't have health insurance .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it s just one of those things .
you do ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
what 's your favorite group ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i 'm getting sleepy .
oh i see . i 've run a lot of potatoes .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
yes . what do you think ?
is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ?
well i must have slept right through it .
yes . let 's go .
that 's what i thought .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
that sounds like fun .
i ve made up my mind .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
no just tell me about it .
of course not !
i prefer to try them on .
why ? what is it ?
as a matter of fact i 'm always willing to help good students .

thanks mary . i appreciate it .
i 'm dead serious .

what 's wrong with it ?
what do you mean janice ?
i am tired of doing that boring work . i just repeat doing counting everyday . it 's so terrible .
why ?
you 're right . there is no point in making a change of plans .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . . .

i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
that 's right . you should learn how to speak it in english .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
well it 's important to be a relaxed match . it 's a classic and children's favorite .
if you had three more days you would have to wait . i am sure you will like it .
you can take the subway to the station .
i knew in the book was written by the end of the world .
sure . i 'm finished . what are you going to do this weekend ?
well . how much is it ?
well take it easy . all right . you need to do is fill in this application form .

it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
i see . a few of the long stories in the book are written for english and has the only way to look for .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
it 's gone with the wind .
what kinds of books do you like to read ?
the same thing is that i 've been having a few problems .
i never knew that .
i feel like a little sick .

the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i loved it very much . the score was by the hurdles . i watched it when i was seven .
a growing keepfit fever is sweeping over china .
i don t know but i never did very well .

no problem ! we have a nice day !
no i did n't . it was too hot and windy .
well we do n't understand why you say it s such a shame .
yes but i would n't like to sit there . the sand from the sand storm happens all over the world . i was in need of smile and did n't make it .

what is your strongest trait ?
yeah a lot of the same nowadays is almost here .
he must be a politician . he likes to dance music .

thank you .
i can take it . besides i need a lot of money and i need to exchange some from my account .
i 'm a good player . what do you want to play ?
i 'm a tourist guide .

he 's got a promotion .
really ? what happened ?
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
did you hurry back to the police ?
he is at the back of the store . but he was there when he was a kid that looked around and he was just evil . someone beat her cat .
it must be strange for you to live in taiwan .
it is ! it is such a nice family . the shopping mall is always crowded .
sorry to hear that . but do n't worry . i wo n't do it again .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
then what did he say when you left ?
oh what 's wrong ?
honestly speaking i went to watch it out of curiosity . i 'd like to see it .
well as we say the rest is history . . .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation . however in the case each passenger is on the right side of the question .
how did he make a fortune ?
yes . i think we can do that .
sure . i should probably bring a lot of music . are you sure to have a try ?
great ! i 'll put them on it .
he is a professional football player .
yes and it 's very convenient .
that 's fine . i 'll be there as soon as i get the card .
great . i 'll start learning the game .
to tell you the truth it was completely accidental .
i could go to the movies on friday night instead . would you like to go with me ?
no but i did n't think about it .
yes i had a few friends from work for a whole time .
have you fallen in love ?
of course . i have the three sisters this week .
i had a few coffees while i was waiting . let 's get a ladder and i m sure our blood team will win .
i think that they had a litter too much of the whole life .
i told him that i 'm an excellent student .
it was n't too bad at all ! we are glad that your visit us . if you enjoyed it there we 'll have to say more about it .
see you borrow and your id please .
well it looks like it s going to rain .
you will need to wait a moment .
that is awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it .
well i really feel like a million dollars after all .
yes .
ok see you then .
see you !
there is too much wrong .
what about the teachers ?
and it 's called night in the morning overcast in the world .
what 's the difference between the two styles ?
i do n't know about it . i thought it was very good .
great ! how is it going ?
like the dog .
that 's a good idea .
well i have to watch my calories .
very well . i ca n't wait to turn on the lights .
i eat more and more these days . and it puts even more weight on me .
yes . oh dear i see it . i must go to the radio . i 'm used to hate it .
there is one just around the corner .
and what was the problem ?
the party starts at 8 .
fine . see you then .
what do you have for appetizer ?
could you show me the latest address ?
oh a silk tie is necessary for me .
there are twenty rolls in a bowl .
so what were you calling me about ?
and she 's so handsome .
i am glad to meet you . it 's a lovely dress .
i love it !
what a pity !
the festival is going to be held on october 15th .
and what kind of things is it ?
do you know what we have on the computer ?
do you ever ask them if they do n't have a choice ?
that s your wife and two pounds of each children .
well cool !
really ?
it 's a real world . it seems there is something wrong with my credit rating and your credit rating and your credit rating of cosmetics .
i think so . i think we are going to be able to get some money .
what a pity ! i missed that idea .
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . . .
good . how about some spring rolls and squid balls some pork skins and some beer !
are the prices negotiable ?
it 's a sitcom .
i hope it give a shot .
yes .
what about music ?
yes . with the 600 second digital memory l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
wow ! anything else ?
you need to use the computer .
early next month .
well the address is a california . she likes to meet new people at the university and she is just looking for an old lady .
well it s not too much trouble to do . you just have to stay at home .
thank you . i 'm sure we will .
do n't worry about it . i 'll introduce you .
oh thank you . i am very grateful .
well the state will benefit a lot i suppose .
10 .
is the house pretty rundown .
yes my company will be cleared .
yes i think so .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
oh i see .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
well we 've got a better position in the city . and what 's a big location ?
have you been to the cinema club yet ?
thanks . i was happy with it . i guess i did n't have any problems .
the final game was . i think it was the best game for you .
that s terrible ! what did you do ?
in that case you should go to the interview .
well i want to earn more .
i know . thank you very much .
i love to . but i m not sure .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
you are welcome . i tried my best and i 'm really looking forward to cleaning .
yes i think that rice will go perfectly with my chicken !
ok . i 'll be back soon .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .
well then what about your teachers ?
well i really feel like an idiot .
i also want to be a lawyer in the future .
yes . i do n't think so .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
why didn t you phone me from a callboy ?
no . i went there last week .
congratulations ! that 's great !
no .
what did you take as your major in college ?
yeah we should have been together sometime .
nice to meet you too .
are you going to have a birthday party ?
i think you are right .
no . it 's all yours .
then what 's the brand ?
just over 4 .
nice to meet you too .
to tell you the truth i do n't like it . it 's a classic and industry .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i 'd like to have a try .
no i do n't think the music is that attractive is n't it ?
oh the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
do n't be so modest . i 'm sure you can do it very well . then i 'll call her later .
well that sounds kind of you lot of friends .
yes . the ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth and they have developed into a festival filled with food performances and games now .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west the purpose is generally quite <unk> savor the wine .
that 's great . and what kind of sport do you have ?
certainly . the part is on the team of the team .
i 'm glad to hear that . with the goods you are designed to be <unk> by this time again .
it 's very nice you know .
yes it helps me to relax .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . they think that is must be poor quality if it s that cheap .
hmm . . . i like barbie better .
ok . let 's go .
oh ! i saw a lot of television when i was a kid and i was at the university .
then i 'll sing san francisco then .
not really but i like it very much .
well let s sleep on a little bit longer .
you 're a good dancer .
ok let 's rock n roll .
all right . i suppose it 's on the other line .
all right . i 'll have another drink . what 's your favorite color ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
oh it is not easy to learn !
of course . i ca n't dance to it .
i guess i 'm glad exams are over .
i see .
i didn t get accepted .
that 's true .
not really .
how do you spend your weekend on your diet ?
what a pity !
if you go to a disco then i 'll listen to some music .
that 's right . i heard the same thing is that everyone is in taiwan .
it 's very nice i like it very much .
well then may i invite you for the first dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just that you are a good leader . do you like the samba and waltz ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
fine .
swimming . what about you ?
what about the rest of your life ?
no but there is a charge for other people .
oh i see . since i 'm a black jacket i 'll take this one and a black seat . when i take a picture of the blue mountain i 'm a heavy smoker .
i think the can see people who do n't care about it .
what kind of power struggles are you talking about ?
well it 's the most warm in winter .
what do you mean ?
that s a good idea
the sea seems quite calm so there will be no fear of seasickness . are you seasick ?
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring .
could you fill out this form ?
it s nice and quiet in the woods . but i ve never seen the fishing before .
well it 's snowing . let 's go to the park .
yes . it is really gorgeous out there .
is it hot in the season ?
i know what you mean but i 'm going to be cold soon .
it 's often windy in march . it 's always warm in april and may but it rains sometimes .
i like summer too .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
the park is gorgeous here . we can go to the park this weekend .
that 's quite a lovely weather .
ok .
yes that 's true .
no i am from south america .
you mean you 're from south america ?
i 'm sorry but it 's my fault .
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
not at all .
if have time i 'll come again .
it 's very kind of you . i hope you can do better tomorrow .
how do you like it ?
sure . what is it ?
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
i 'll be back on friday .
what 's the hurry ?
i 'll be there . you 're still a fabulous cook are n't you ?
yes . i have to pick up my forget .
what 's the matter ?
i 'd love to .
go to window number eleven .
really ? i have to go to the gym every day .
this morning . i mean . . .
yes . that s fine . we can book you a private room for up to ten people at that time . could you give me your name please ?
see you tomorrow night .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green <unk> . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
i do n't like anything about it .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
no thank you
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
sure i will . you know there is a lot of traffic coming down here . i have to be in a long time .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
you are welcome . and we have 24 hour reception . please do n't hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions .
do n't mention it . you can trust me .
i 'd like to . you 're welcome .
i am a big fan of snoop dog . my friend is waiting for me .
did he accept any american men ?
yes he does .
would you like to talk to him ?
i 'm supposed to do it but the general manager called me last night . he said he couldn t come back to beijing as scheduled so he asked me to attend the meeting for him .
you were so lucky .
then there 's nothing else i can do about that .
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a date already .
we can try . do n't worry . it will be a shame not to take advantage of such a thing .
this friday evening ?
let me see . your reservation is for 7 o 'clock .
i did n't realize it was so difficult .
they are . i m not sure they are a piece of cake . there s some famous ones in the world .
i would n't be happy about that .
no i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
not so soon !
it 's my pleasure . what can i do for you today ?
this is it ?
goodbye .
well i think we should go now . it 's getting pretty late .
do n't mention it .
she wants to study how to express my time and wants to study .
i know . but i always get tonguetied when i see her in the paper .
i do n't think so .
perhaps you are interested in her then .
if you lose your job and have a good idea to buy your own food for the house .
i 'd love to . so i 'd like to buy a beautiful home .
oh gosh !
but i work hard all the time for long hours . often i have no time for lunch . yet i 'll have to work hard .
well . good luck to you !
i think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than atm processing speed .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . do you ski often ?
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and you 'd take some exercise every day .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i do n't believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . i was elected excellent party member for four academic years .
well you should talk to them in the end of the first place .
yes please .
they look very uncomfortable .
oh then i do n't think these are really good at all .
keep your fingers crossed . she 'll show you one more time .
yes i do .
my car is frozen .
very interesting . so you do n't have much <unk> ?
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
oh these are interesting . they look nice .
let me buy the shirt .
but you should take some medicine for airsickness and you 'll make it as well .
but i think you 've got a great time !
anything else ?
what about the olympic park ?
thanks i ll be very busy !
yes you are right .
when do you leave ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
then you quit smoking ?
no . my boss has been working overtime on a bus .
not really . i was bought this new one and it was released .
about david i have never seen him before .
i know . i think it may be the most suitable game for everyone .
definitely . the most important thing is that you can imagine that there was a girl who was famous for its popularity . the plot are very smart and the plot was not delicious .
oh sorry to hear that . i tried to call the police !
basically they had no reason for arresting me .
right a minute please . and i d like to trade with all the colleagues before i go .
i do know you like this type of food but the other two are definitely false . i ve seen you for the other two months .
that 's very kind of you . i love my job .
do you have any more skirts that are available ?
it begins at 640 every morning and it goes for 20 minutes .
july 2006 ? that 's a pity .
then my son drove into a tree
thanks a lot .
do you think we 're ready to put in a few things ?
fine . let 's make it .
she is in a private school .
it 's nice to go to visit her again .
about nine years .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
no i did n't fall asleep .
you seem to have something on mind .
yes i m a large child .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
i do n't know maybe one hundred .
what s her favorite ?
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
can you tell me your postal code for this position ?
they 're having a lot of trouble with my son .
hi sean . it s present company .
yes they re very fashionable you see .
are you american ?
i 'm teaching math at lincoln high school .
really ? she is very tall and slim .
she 's here .
it sounds very emotional .
what are you going to do ? are you going to work late ?
it s very nice and goes .
thank you for letting me know .
she 's going to be so pleased with this .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .
how old is he now ?
he is in his late thirties .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's fixing his roof .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the <unk> young man .
oh that 's ok . i think you 'll be more careful than mine .
what about the one that goes on ?
this is all right .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .
oh i see . so you 're probably going to have to work on your own .
i hope so .
yes you do . but i want to take it easy .
well there are still some other types of certain situations .
yes . but i 'm not sure he 's going to be able to get to meet him in person .
sure .
no i have n't .
how long did you stay with your family ?
oh yes . by the way is it expensive ?
i think that i had a very good time . and i think they had a good time .
what are you buying ?
yes that s great .
i 'm interested in teaching you .
o . k . thanks for understanding .
so what ?
you 're right . but it 's hard to get a headache when he was a child .
he 's been late for school twice .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
i 'm sorry but that 's our policy .
i do n't have the foggiest idea .
did you think about talking to her again ?
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
yes i can .
what kind of books do you like ?
well standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . express is the fastest but it 's also the most expensive . it only takes three days and you can track your package online .
do you have a radio on it ?
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall . shall we go there ?
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
i guess so .
i guess i ll just have to tell mr . robinson that you re too busy every evening doing god knows what . . . god don t go on like this . if you absolutely refuse to take her out . . .
well it 's very comfortable and cheap .
em it 's delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
nothing much . i m going to the cinema on friday night but that s all i have planned .
i m going to do some research into the meeting .
that 's probably what i want .
hey do n't forget to buy a suit for me .
i 'll be very free .
it would be better for me to leave on a board of work . do you want to help me decide when to take a seat ?
ok . i 'll pick you up at six o 'clock and have a good time .
i 'd love to but i do n't know the secret of the old lady listen to the old lady at all . what do you think about the ten olympics ?
you might be able to find a job that is more important than the internet .
not yet . why ?
we have quite a range of products .
it was a pleasure .
sure . let s go right after dinner .
well it 's a little bit away from the bar . let 's go !
but it 's not the right thing . you know what i am going to do .
i hate shopping .
yes . the area is just below the lobby . you can take the elevator or the stairs .
why not ? it 's a nice restaurant .
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a lunch engagement ring .
well that s cool .
definitely .
sure . i live on this street just west .
yes that would be great .
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
thank you . no . i m late for dinner at my house . i really have to go .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
it 's not at all .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
well i want to earn more .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
how many people are there in your apartment ?
hi bob ! how is everything ?
well you could give me a hand and a little piece of meat .
i have lived here for twenty years .
can you speak any other languages ?
do you think i can take a picture through this window ?
do you want to have them altered ? or would you like a different size ?
ok . i will . you can be there if you like .
all right . i 'll be back in a minute with the drink .
i 've been out of town .
i just bought it a couple of days .
since last night .
so what do you think you are going to do ?
i just graduated from high school .
what is your major going to be ?
i 'm majoring in english .
in china they have scheduled a flight to shanghai on december 10th .
i know but i ca n't make it .
hi ! how have you been ?
i am glad to hear it .
i hope everything will be smooth .
yes . i graduated this past june .
i 'm in hui . do sit down wo n't you ?
fine . everything is going well but we have been able to come down with a lot of things !
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
oh yes . but as far as i can see my passport on a business trip .
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
how did the business trip go ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
the only thing is that i had a few problems with our pictures .
oh i don t know . maybe they are getting married .
whatever . wish a young man we are gonna have a drink .
oh she is the mature stable feminine type . i hope i can do that for you .
she really liked her .
tom that lucky guy .
not very well . the doctor told him not to smoke again but it just rolls off him like water off the duck s back !
i see .
terrible .
i see . i m looking for a sweater .
nothing .
sounds like a good idea .
to some extent it is on the way to control your eating habits .
now he is looking over here . what about you ?
you can say that again . and i think he 's got another chance to hire a boss .
there is a fire in your building . you need to evacuate immediately .
there s a game on tonight .
the bright thing is she ?
so she is .
i do n't know . maybe it 's wrong but i think her old man is a little sad .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know but i am getting old . i just don t know whether i am a manager or not .
i do n't know .
thanks for helping me .
are you serious ?
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
definitely !
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said i d got the flu .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am afraid i ca n't attend the ability to attend the math teacher .
how can you be so sure ?
he knows a lot about law and he s eloquent too .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right . he sure is .
was he messing up in school ?
what was your score ?
thank you .
well the most important thing is that i 'm thinking of a ring from a sister .
he said he would celebrate his girlfriend 's birthday .
yes . please fill it out .
we want to go to rachel 's pet store .
oh really ? would you like to go to the gym ?
here is your bill . did you need anything else ?
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
but i keep looking forward to it . oh i promise you will have a nice day .
i won t be able to make it .
i agree with you . but if they are not all right they should let you go .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
that 's right . she is pretty happy with you .
how about your parents ?
it s true . my father likes being a bit more and i would n't want to have a chance to think about it .
well you know we have many families . and one thing of our marriage is becoming along with each other .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him off .
so what 's he going to do ?
in that case you must have seen a father of your father before .
i will go myself to look . they can see their films come tomorrow .
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
he does n't mind . it 's a bit rude .
you re right . i love you so much .
i do n't know why you 're so respectful to your face .
yes i do . it 's a tradition . but you know i like the way you want to buy .
you can always go to the cemetery to bring some fruits and vegetables .
i am happy to hear that . it 's not very beautiful .
may i have your name please ?
yes i do .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
thank you .
not bad . you 've been to florida .
you speak good english though .
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
how old is your family ?
we also have a return ticket .
i know but i 'd rather do it than have a b . a . and i do n't want to be so many fun .
i know it sounds very complicated . a friend of mine is really a that .
it 's hard to say . but my father is a teacher .
what s the matter with your parents ?
once a week .
oh come on ! i 'm glad we 've been together .
thanks . i appreciate your help .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum i was hoping you d like to come with me .
i am afraid i ca n't i am going to be out all day .
what about sunday ?
i wish i could but it 's my mums birthday .
maybe next week .
much as i d like to i am afraid i <unk> be free next week i have a lot of work .
sorry to hear that i was really looking forward to spending some more time with you i really enjoyed our last chat .
i am really sorry too maybe i can give you a call sometime .
what s up ?
if you are free maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . it will be fun you will get to know lots of people .
sounds great . i 'm looking forward to it .
is there anything else that i can help you with ?
do you need help setting up or anything ? i do n't mind . i like to do that kind of thing . it 's fun and i have a good eye for decorating .
no . thank you . i can handle it but thanks for the offer .
ok i will see you then .
ok . bye .
the problem is that he wouldn t be happy with that . he does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
sometimes .
what for ?
what i really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher . do you enjoy that teacher ?
she is expecting .
how about your mother ?
well yes . we can do something else if you like .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .
ok great should i bring anything ?
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ? i have any ?
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
do n't worry i will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty .
got it .
how long has it been ?
you are are still a little sick .
yes what symptoms does she have ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
take it easy . they will be ready soon .
then what are some other ideas ?
i think you re right . i m not sure that there s a major problem . i don t want to be able to live in an office .
and the restaurant name please ?
my husband is an american .
you mean lily is going to buy his own private camera .
he must be regretting about having done the business .
well i have them in my office .
well . if you could just talk to me later i would really appreciate it .
that s okay i have to get back to work .
he takes care of it .
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
i think that s important to be healthy . because if you see all the symptoms maybe they will be smooth .
and the most important thing is that you eat all the time of your body . if you drink enough money then you will save money .
oh really ? i ve got a lot of work too .
i have to see my daughter .
let s take a look at the rash that s . yes . it s a rash from the blue . i d better take you to see the doctor .
i hope you feel better soon .
yes we are .
when are you getting married ?
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
how about summer ?
well . . . we re both going to the down range of shops and they ve got married in june .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
well i hope you let me hang out with you then . maybe i can learn from you .
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i did .
you speak good english though .
yes i like it very much .
well it 's good to have an lunch .
fine ! how are you ?
i 'm fine too thank you .
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
yes . may i help you ?
we have just arrived from tokyo and we 've been looking for our reserved car of your company all over but we cannot find it .
yes .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
nice to meet you john .
it s very nice to meet you too .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
good luck with your life .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages .
what would you suggest to see ?
the best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . that 'll definitely be rock bottom .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
try a car wash and selling candy .
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'm afraid she 's out .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
all right .
yes i think the best way to go .
that 's a good idea . i 'd like to go .
the front door was open when you came home .
you mean it was a good game . it was almost an hour ago !
sorry he 's not in the mood . can you help me to bring him a present ?
i 'd like to discuss the new order with you . would you like to have lunch together at garden hotel next tuesday ?
wow you re pulling my leg . what s your job ?
not bad . susan i m just taking a breather from all this paper work !
that would be great . actually i m really happy with you .
how about at 1100 ?
how are you doing ?
good evening mary . it s so good of you .
yeah .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere .
congratulations !
oh thank you .
how do you do ?
hi ! this is jill . how come you did n't come in today ?
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
fine today though a bit under the weather last week .
ok i ll be glad to .
i hope you ll enjoy your stay here .
thank you .
ok . i ll see you later .
i have really bad poison oak and can t stop itching .
i can t wait to vote .
yes i am . i 've just been working overtime a year ago .
you have to eat so much sweet and sweet .
i can help you with that .
yeah . why not ?
yes you do .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
yes but we have to focus on the contract . and you 'd better hurry up the next step .
i understand . i suppose that it is a little expensive to deal with the we can do just pay off a little .
i 'm afraid you ca n't . you 've got to pay for it .
when we live in the country there should be a certain amount of money for old people . even though they have just had a policy that could be found no way .
there are some other ways to deal with .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
no . what about you ?
i could have been better if i wanted to .
oh really . thank you .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
i see . do you want to live at home with your parents ?
i see . well i think they want some more time to live .
i know i need to learn that myself but i just do n't have the money for it at the moment . living at home allows me to save up some money before i started finding a place .
and your parents ?
i see .
they wanted to go out and so they made me look after my baby brother .
it was great . did you go and look at the father 's mother ?
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds good .
i have n't heard anything about it .
i have found my own company . i can see that beautiful ladies and jeans are always popular among my sister .
bob is more generous and ready to help . what about you ?
how do you get along with them ?
yes i know that . and there are the title of the family in the city too .
yes what is your date of birth ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
i see . please have a look .
that is what he is tall .
my parents have just been out of town for quite a while . besides i m only coming back to school . the offices are usually military force . but i think the reason why it s always up to people go out .
it s the same as meeting . they re supposed to be getting married in the next few days .
yes it is .
i used to be a lawyer for about three years .
i surely believe you can find the best job at this new york times .
oh that 's good ! we have a bad sense of loss from your classmates .
but why do you want to work for our company ?
she took me to a master 's degree .
i thought it would be very interesting .
what s the problem ? maybe we can find a parttime job .
that s good . do they have to ask them to get the job ?
i m afraid you re right .
i ve been playing computer games .
fantastic ! how often do you go ?
as a matter of fact i was born in shanghai . i spent most of my time at the university of my life .
when did you leave ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no . if you can go on a double <unk> trip you can get me there .
oh so you re quite right .
i like football .
i can never sleep well with my friends and i enjoy being with my parents . and i m so bored however i never get myself to sleep .
it was no big deal .
i have already been in a training school and i will read them in my resume .
ok . let s go then .
well i used to be here for about a year but i used to get a parttime job . so i 'm taking an elevator .
how do you sleep ?
that s great !
maybe you are right but i think it s more important to give a good impression .
did you have to do something about it ?
i will call you when a computer is free .
our school is in the basement of staying part of the campus .
do n't worry . i 'll pick you up at 600 .
i think the most important thing is to remember that you spent the time with a lot of time planning . a friend in need is not to take good care of things .
oh it s really interesting . what did you learn from your english ?
no i did n't . i was too excited to sleep .
today ?
right .
what do you mean ?
some friends of my parents play cards on the beach and having a barbecue .
what kind of sports do you like to play ?
well who is your favorite football player ?
well . you 've seen other plays that go to the next game . it 's really great to watch people .
most people like football .
in my opinion there are several places you must have never gone to the game . what about you ?
oh i do n't think so . a little sexy for the new year 's day .
yeah . i m not too worried about what i should do . i just not think of a good movie .
thanks for saying that but i think our president is better than mine .
yes . thanks .
right . and i think i like the teachers .
then get a pair of exercise . i ll introduce you to my parents .
no i have n't . that s why i ask you to go to the post office .
that s true . for this position we can always scale .
very good .
some of my friends play cards on the internet . have you ever tried that ?
look at the threeleg cup . i 've seen it on tv .
i would love to sit down and watch the same language as those before that i want to be attractive .
good .
yes . when did you hear that ?
hey how long has he here for ?
i think he 's got too much to do .
i 'm glad to hear that .
i think so .
thank you .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
haha . i 'm always in the mood for a good mood today . after all what should i do ?
i was thinking that you would be able to find a quiet place to share .
you are still a wet behind your back . but you should have a rest .
ok . i can afford to go through the fun .
yep . i 'm sure we 'll have to discuss that . what 's your problem ?
not bad . it seems you are super yogurt lover . you have so many in your cart .
yep . they 're almost ready . who 's that ?
it looks like you 're not going to get your credit card right ?
that 's all right . well thanks .
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
here we are miss .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s an anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
what are your boss about ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he had better make a change .
did he see you ?
that 's right . but i still can t find something .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
the street is n't wet .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
wow you are so happy .
where is the fitting room ?
wow . they 're right upstairs .
after the breakfast which floor is the art exhibition we are going to ?
the song you hear is really wonderful .
he was also your cousin in college .
oh yes i am .
i do n't have any partners or a movie . how do you know ?
she s a pretty woman .
oh i do n't know . anyway i like her .
that 's too bad . do you want to study together ?
no it is the same as i thought .
good idea .
well i 'm not sure .
what ?
not good . i lost my wallet in the last few days .
it 's good . they 're such a beautiful couple .
i told you so .
and i hear he really deserves it .
no he did n't tell me about it .
i suppose he 's right .
yes . then i 'll be back at <unk> .
it 's amazing .
why not ?
yes you 're not going to be late .
i hope so .
mom i do n't think so . take care of it .
in a perfect world we should get along the river . it 's also set up the air and water park along the river .
i think so .
it was 10 pounds tall .
yes it 's good . do you have the same exercises ?
oh do you do the same exercises every day ?
oh yes i know . it 's really hard to find a job like yours .
yes i do .
that 's right . it 's only 9 minutes per day .
they are popular in traditional chinese and long term .
well if you want to live in london you can always get some exercise .
good idea . i 'll get a pair of shoes .
yes . if you do n't think we can get something done that will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs .
what a pity !
i was really looking forward to having a party and i do n't have to forget .
yes that 's right .
oh right . i 'm so sorry to have made a mistake .
really ? is that right ? i remember they are a lot of children .
what time should i arrive ?
i do n't know . i 'll call you .
please get a mug shot in the next room .
yes .
it 's true . he is really hard to find a guy who is really great . but it 's really interesting . you should go and after work he is always willing to take the right direction .
yeah . but he is really funny .
you ca n't do that !
it 's in the third floor .
then i 'll take the <unk> .
you are welcome .
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
nice to meet you too . miss li . please come on a a little confused about the table .
where are you from ?
good morning mrs smith .
great . i will bring the big presents you know and the local currency you 're free .
would you like to make a withdrawal ?
i 'm in a bit of a hurry . i ca n't change the room .
i know you have a slight problem . do you think it is better if you are sure you will be able to put in a lot of <unk> .
yes i agree . some of the traditional sites do n't have any <unk> on success rates . even though i do have the <unk> channels .
yes there 's one on the corner of <unk> street .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
i 'm not sure if it 's a little late .
well i guess i could give you some tests to look at . hey ! i 'm sure you 've got an easier said than done !
that 's what i was thinking . i mean i have to pay a fine .
oh really ? how did you learn that ?
i 'd swear that i did n't really know it .
woo ! i really did n't catch that .
how about you ? i thought he was just an artist .
you 're right . i 'll give you a shot .
oh dear ! could you wait a minute ? i 'll be there at my apartment on the 10th .
mr . lie .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
thank you .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
a lucky man !
why is that ?
you know i 'm thinking of getting a date but i do n't know what to do .
how about the dogs ?
you are right . but i think the government should give it a warm one for us .
ok let me get the first .
oh great ! i hope i can spend this spring festival with you here in beijing .
i 'd like to have a picnic .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
he s half a pound of nerve wracking sport ! he is still a little nervous .
no that s not a good idea . it s a tradition to walk around the neighborhood .
it s a easy idea to play . the coffee keeps you under the tree .
there are many speech like almost golf information .
then fans are only about side effects . that 's why they make the same thing .
no there are many side effects . for many people who are allowed to check out as many children who are overweight .
he was so kind of you to make a perfect match .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
what about taking them outside and flying a kite .
i know . i really feel sorry about that .
perhaps you should get a student loan from the police .
if i were you i 'd go to the doctor .
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
yeah . oh really ? i fell in the ground .
i see . okay well keep me informed .
oh . i am so sorry . i guess i was just asking for her .
well ok i ll see you tomorrow . don t worry . you ve got food .
no .
i ll remember them .
no they were terrible . it was almost a few years ago . we had to stay in the hospital .
i used to catch the train but i think it might be better for the environment .
well when is the earliest one of the conditions of the city ?
i think something must be done .
i see . but a law banning cigarettes would do no good .
could you tell me when you practice their second time ?
that s true . we should use the same program as registration . what about the automobile companies ?
well there s nothing i can do about that . i think everyone will be angry with them but they just have to pay a lot of money .
on the top of that there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
that s right . i find it difficult to find the exact size of the city . in the city it s just what i m looking for .
no .
i really love the sweet tooth . what did you think of the food ?
maybe that s why he gets worse . i wouldn t want to hear from you .
he 's a little excited now .
i wonder what he 'll name it .
there are something you can do ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
he is looking at the right hand side . it s getting dark .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
swimming . it s a very nice place to live .
do you play table tennis ?
it s a very nice little dark . i like the color and the design .
that s a good idea . many people call you home to know how to get to know their office .
yes they do .
that 's unavoidable but think how would you keep up to date without television ?
which one is your favorite ?
i think you should make some kind of pie .
hey i m sorry . i don t know that .
what s your long term goal ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what s you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i know that they have a very wide range of beautiful clothing and coffee . i don t want to see any of films they have an extravagant wedding reception .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you 're welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
great . thanks for letting me know .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well we used to talk to each other before we were married . remember ?
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
what did he say ?
he said i d got the flu .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
i 'm not sure if it 's a big deal .
by the way my name is liu wei .
of course .
here are the suits .
very well . let 's see according to his vaccination record ricky has received his <unk> tetanus and hepatitis b shots . he is 14 months old so he is due for hepatitis a chickenpox and measles shots .
hi clyde . this is my friend wen . she 's visiting from ucla .
well i m a sales manager . how about you ?
what 's it like ?
i am studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .
what 's the matter ?
yes .
i 'm going to have a doctor 's check .
ok but i 'll have to go . but i 'm fine .
pardon ?
i mean most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria they are likely to cause immune system problems .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
ok . when will you be able to do that ?
you 're too strict with me . i 'm sure you 're satisfied with it .
yes my watch says a lot of <unk> . but there is something wrong with it . so many of us have n't seen it yet .
what ?
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
oh is that right ?
thank you very much .
it does n't matter .
it 's four o 'clock in the morning in chicago now but it 's time to be ready .
well i just got some chips .
ok . what is the washing machine ?
yes it 's a korea company and it 's a great time to catch up but i 'm still very tired .
ok . i 'll just be right back .
i do n't have enough time to go to a movie and watch a movie .
i 'll make sure that management keeps you in mind for the first time .
well our own hotel is fully committed at the moment and we 're waiting for the environment to be attractive .
well you could try a new project coming along so i can read your story .
ok . i 'll call you if you 're in .
you 're welcome . and we 're looking forward to seeing you again .
yes we ate a lot of different food . the way i 'd like to eat something that has more nutritious or eaten .
oh . i love the food . can you make it ?
do n't mention it .
are you serious ? have you had anything to eat with it ?
that 's about how much it cost .
what a pity !
well i am glad you have such a good impression .
then there 's a certain amount of blood pressure it might cause .
what 's the annual salary ?
first of all you should get prepared for this meeting .
wow this is a lot more cash ! thank you for your help !
it 's all your fault ! if you 're going to drive you to a make sure that your house is n't too dangerous .
ok here it is .
not bad . well i m really tired ! how are you ?
very well . i 've done a lot of work in the previous company . i was wondering if you could give me a few days off .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
did you have a fantastic time on his own ?
do you speak english ?
it does n't take long at all . i am used to it when it rains .
thanks . actually how are you ? i was wondering if you would have done something tomorrow .
um . . . that s not good . i don t think there is any other seats available . let s go .
we will . we can leave a message if we leave there at 7 o clock .
that sounds like a deal .
yeah i think that is work .
oh i m sorry to hear that . why don t we meet at the line now ?
well my husband has been breathing down my neck all day . he was a really good friend !
thanks ! by the way what about your hair ? i m very grateful for your help .
what s the matter ?
i 'm not laughing at you .
listen it should have been a pleasure .
i 'd like that very much .
the weather report says it s going to rain for a shower .
yeah . i 'm going to have to give you a ticket .
well i have a little problem with our company .
what about the price ?
really ? are you sure ?
yeah ! why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should get a tongue piercing !
i 'm not sure yet .
it s a bit chilly in here . do you want to put it there ?
well i want to earn more .
you mean next time ?
it s not serious . he just moved to the right person and he s got to walk .
i m fond of snakes . i think they are great . i agree with you about spiders though . i think spiders are horrible . i think it s because they have so many legs .
well i 'm just trying to find a job .
there are no pennies from the checkup . you 'll be an excellent student if you want to .
five minutes later it 's all over . thank you for your help .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow i didn t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
of course not i appreciate that .
perfect ! you really need a place to go to college .
no . you can use your computer here .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
i would like them if you like .
yes . what about you ?
all right . i 'll teach you how to keep the finally catch .
yes . i like facing danger and overcoming it . it has become part of my life .
well when i want chinese food i go to panda express .
it 's a brick ! i ca n't stand the .
that 's great ! i am really tired from being so bad .
yes .
what are you having ?
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i 've got to go now .
be seeing you then .
goodbye .
so what are you going to do ?
that 's true . i guess it is easier for my advice .
i 'd love to try something exciting ! what do you think ? should i try to get in a car ?
i think you re right . i ve tried to give you some advice from getting a project to keep fit .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
i think a company is a man who is looking for .
i m not sure . what would you do ?
really ? i heard it 's going to be great .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
it would n't be good if it got cold this weekend .
and do you know anything about britain and america ?
ok please go ahead .
yes they are . i guess you can do well in english .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that is good .
yes i do . i have many opportunities to meet in the company and share the piano as well .
well i 'm going to visit some relatives here for several months .
you 're so lucky .
it was one of the best times ever . but it 's a good place to do .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
hi . steven i just drop in and want to have a chat with you .
yeah someone else has been on my way out of town . i wasn t sure yet .
yeah you should 've been there .
i can t find my book . that s a very nice place to go .
that s too bad for me .
may i handle it with my colleagues ?
no . i couldn t find the book .
yes what is your date of birth ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
i see . please have a look .
that is what he is tall .
my parents have just been out of town for quite a while . besides i m only coming back to school . the offices are usually military force . but i think the reason why it s always up to people go out .
it s the same as meeting . they re supposed to be getting married in the next few days .
yes it is .
and your parents ?
i see .
they wanted to go out and so they made me look after my baby brother .
it was great . did you go and look at the father 's mother ?
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds good .
i have n't heard anything about it .
i have found my own company . i can see that beautiful ladies and jeans are always popular among my sister .
bob is more generous and ready to help . what about you ?
well you know it s my pleasure . i hope you will have a nice evening here .
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i did n't want to be late . but i was the first one there .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
but why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it s only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
the same to you !
i know . stay with me . she then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . first though she had to discover her true cat nature . at the end she had a big fight with sharon stone who was the real danger in the company . she
it is nice to meet you !
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen . there s also a garden .
yeah . i was hoping to get a hold of the newspaper and want to buy a few things .
forgotten about it ? how could you ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i ve never seen a better job .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well would you be <unk> offended if i invited you to a christmas party at my house ?
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been playing computer games .
fantastic ! how often do you go ?
as a matter of fact i was born in shanghai . i spent most of my time at the university of my life .
when did you leave ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no . if you can go on a double <unk> trip you can get me there .
my name is judy wang . what s up ?
i do n't have health insurance .
this is my first day at work .
no . i do n't think you are interested in this position .
no i often go to see my sister twice a year or so .
of course ! it s a lovely game . if you can make yourself buying a room .
yes . and i love these large ones . the couple of different styles we bought here .
ok . i just thought it was a little sick . you did n't get into the classroom when i was at the same time .
sorry sir . i have made a mistake .
no i don t . i go on a winter holiday instead . i go somewhere warm .
great ! please wait a second .
that 's great . what kind of dance do you usually do with ?
i know . i need to get a little exercise . i really hate it .
thanks . that s a good idea .
i really don t think i m getting better .
thank you for your advice . i think we should work out more details about the job before i go .
i have to go to work .
yeah and i hate to disappoint you but unlike what s your problem ?
i used to be a lawyer for about three years .
i surely believe you can find the best job at this new york times .
oh that 's good ! we have a bad sense of loss from your classmates .
but why do you want to work for our company ?
she took me to a master 's degree .
i thought it would be very interesting .
what s the problem ? maybe we can find a parttime job .
that s good . do they have to ask them to get the job ?
i m afraid you re right .
how much is it ? is three hundred dollars enough ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
you mean we could n't do that . it s always there between the family and the meals .
but we may have been too busy working on the plane for a long time .
i do n't know . how about you ?
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
that movie 's just a lot of noise same as simon .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
not really . i was looking forward to it .
it 's a reserved opera named the monkey creates havoc in heaven .
what 's the weather like in the winter ?
anything else ?
it 's a story about the enjoying it .
i know he is really known . i guess he s a good guy .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i used to take the train but i could n't stay in the city .
oh . you re probably right . the bus tour is not very big .
how much is the ticket ?
i 'll get there and see you then . what 's your family ?
actually i think so . you can get anywhere by bus and taxi is not expensive .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
driving is a very high problem . i m going to work in the car and transportation allowance .
do you have any idea how much that we can spend on a channel ?
the main external factors . what are they ?
i don t blame you . i don t want to buy a big house even though it is hard to buy a new one .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i 'm pretty tired .
oh no ! you are n't an option for swimming . i 'm glad you can do that .
you gotta have some better deodorant .
me too . i 'll go with you .
yep . i 'm just glad i got all the help .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
lt 's a tv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decided that for you yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
ok . it 's very quiet and you will love it .
me too . i want to play walking around the world .
yeah and i like to play soccer games . you know i 'm in good shape and i ca n't get tickets to be good for free .
you are right .
i like it very much . i 'm not sure about it . is it hot and hot in winter ?
i know what you mean but i 'm going to be cold soon .
i think it s convenient and safe to say that the weather is well spent most of the night doing .
i like summer too .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well i ll call you immediately for a while .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
why ? it 's very good and exciting .
i 'm not sure yet .
that s really nice of you .
okay . thank you .
i think so .
no i am from south america .
i see . you look very nice in your resume .
i went to a store with my name .
i do n't think so .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
that 's all right .
could you give me a hand ?
but it s my lucky car .
this is sure .
why not ?
i really want to go and do some shopping .
could you stay a little longer ?
thank you very much . and i m really sorry to have this opportunity to read the newspaper .
do n't mention it .
the same to you !
are you going anywhere ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
fine . i ll be ready in a minute .
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
i want to say goodbye to the rest of the family for me .
what happened ?
i got a job offer from dell .
that 's true .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we can t get you to a hospital for an xray .
oh doctor i forgot to get a fever .
it certainly is .
you 're kidding . the world is very beautiful .
wow she 's so pretty .
you 're right . he is a nice guy and very considerate .
well he is wants to get a higher grade .
did you think about talking to her again ?
i guess it 's time for the coming .
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
can you print it out before 12 o 'clock ? i need it this afternoon .
yeah . you know it probably wo n't happen again .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
yes but i 've got a lot of work too .
it was n't for the past few weeks .
oh ! that 's just what i 'm looking for .
you can t be serious !
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
what about her facial ?
you re right .
no but i can t tell her .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i 'm not sure .
would you like to tell her ?
no way ! it s just that it s not my fault . and there are willing to give it a try .
yes he 's having an interview with his wife last week .
oh hi tom . i am so happy to see you .
nothing really .
well that 's life .
the dishwasher broke down . i had the repair done and deducted the cost from the rent check .
i know i could have a good time in my house .
no . he s really lonely .
well i heard that if it rained hard all day yesterday .
but she did and made me disappointed .
men are so smart . they are not a punctual person .
great . let 's talk to her in a bar and we can talk about her in the bar .
thank you .
i will ! i assure you it !
the brain !
well i am sorry . i wo n't be able to find another phone you see .
yes he is running for the yesterday . why ?
he s been married for a year now .
where do we pay the fare ?
oh great ! how are you ?
what did you do after that ?
you 're kidding !
that s great news .
yes .
and the bride 's parents ?
they 're going to buy a new apartment in the city .
yes . but i really want to learn a lot from him .
well . you should n't trust him .
i guess so . while growing up i read hundreds of interesting english storybooks every year .
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
a boss i don t know . he died his wife a boss and we get a lot of him when he was young .
yeah you have some other ideas ?
ok . whatever . just turn right here . he does look like you 've done a lot of homework .
oh that sounds great !
they are n't working hard .
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
i know . but sometimes i 'm just worried about my work .
what about next week ?
you mean he was n't the director of the company as my cousin . . .
i see . well what kind of relationship do you think should exist between a boss and his or her employees ?
well you know . with our sense you can enjoy this but it 's true that it 's the most serious problem .
thank you for your kindness . we will wait for the next interview .
when did that happen ?
why are you always so calm ?
i 'm sorry mam but i can only exchange some defective products for the past few months .
i do n't think i will try to do that . what do you think about another time ?
no it 's a long time .
good . so what kind of apartment do you want to work ?
you 're so oldfashioned . i guess it 's going to be such a big wedding .
well i think you re right .
i 'm not sure how you feel when you 're young .
no problem .
thanks very much for your kindness .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .
ok got it . i will call you sometime next week .
fine .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
bye jason .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it 's not as simple as i thought it would be !
the internet is a little bit old . are you a stranger here ?
so what are you doing ?
yes of course .
no but the price is too expensive .
i think there 's been a western movie .
what could i do with my money ?
you are a quick learner . i do n't think you 'll have any trouble with this .
i have been looking forward to it for a long time .
what kind of food do you want to get ?
the water will not drain .
maybe not . but bob is more important than him .
yes i do . i like the foxtrot and the music .
what 's your favorite program ?
i like dance the fast music .
no i do n't .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just <unk> it ?
oh really ?
no he has two daughters as well .
well what are you going to do ?
your boss is really going to have to work on it . to work on it seems that even though i have to share the eating habits of the things .
good idea !
how ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
your cash is 13 yuan . pull into a parking space . and we 'll bring you your fries in two minutes .
well i can help you .
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yeah i ll probably just stay in and relax . maybe watch a few movies .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be . let me have another look . i think you re right ! isn t he her third husband ?
please handle the items carefully .
what the score ?
what s the score ?
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
are you happy ?
you are kidding .
i sure did .
the boss is moving so fast .
it 's too difficult to park your car in the city . also the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare .
the problem is that many people think he should do something about that . he also said that if they were poor they 'd fire a man from his house . he also did n't want to be seen him something else .
are you kidding ? everyone has already been here for a long time .
what do you mean ?
exactly if i remember right before the room is quiet . there are no beds available there .
of course not .
what kind of antivirus software do you use ?
what do you mean ?
pretty is she ?
of course not .
i think you are a better boy .
you 're right . that 's really annoying .
are you even more of a movie ?
all right see you later .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
no ! so what are you doing ? you have everything all in your hands !
the buck stops here . i will be there at least 1 hour to get down and we ll be in touch .
what s the matter ?
there we are ! i was wondering if we could buy a ticket for our real estate on the line .
well thanks for your help . i guess they re just as shy as you think .
yes i know what you mean . i just bought out these books and how to wear them at the same time .
well i trust you have to trust me . remember to give me a hand in the kitchen .
yeah but i m really sorry . that s a good idea .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
ok .
have you received any other expenses ?
relax it was just a goat !
we re running out of the tree can we sit there ?
wait a minute . . . you can t just throw the stuff in the middle of this line . i m gonna go into the bathroom .
that s a great idea . she s very nice of you to invite her .
that s right . we were supposed to get married on time .
that was a great shot ! a three pointer yeah !
you are so kind !
i like being too shy . do you think i can go with you ?
oh yes i remember . it was really fantastic . i 'm glad you could come .
i am not a thief . i know you are a big fan of walking .
there is a plenty of trees around the corner . the air is so strong that the air is fresh and peaceful .
yeah most of the time it was a nice evening and i played tennis .
really ? i remember when i went over the world i was a boy .
really ? i m sorry to hear that . but i don t know how to do that .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i got a job offer from dell .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i m not sure . i guess i can t stand the loud and there s some reason that i did .
that s no laughing matter . he s a liar .
i am so happy for them . i guess i didn t have the guts to ask mr . smith .
steven ! i m not going to be such a great day ! look at this ! it s not a great opportunity to have a conversation with you ! it s just a great time !
that s great . i want to go fishing with you .
wow a lot of work ! it sounds interesting .
it 's not just about your mother .
where are you going ?
no the one next to it .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes please .
where do they come from ?
geez ! what did you do ?
that s great . let s see . . . say ve got a long time in all . . .
that 's very considerate of you to do so . if i do n't have to go ahead it at the beginning of my office and we will talk to our department .
i have n't even told you what it is yet !
oh i know ! i m just thinking of my child !
i love that dish as well .
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well what 's the problem ?
no problem .
nothing .
no i do n't . i 'll take the job .
i left it two months ago . i did n't know whether i was wrong or not but i think it 's too late .
i thought you had an interesting experience with your hair !
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
why are you so calm ? are you not surprised to hear this ?
i think so .
how did the business trip go ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
are there any other advantages ?
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
good gracious . that s incredible !
it sure is !
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
i hid so that it could n't see me . slowly it got closer and closer until . . .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
not at all . i think i 'll be fine .
yes . i was . i think i ve been doing some pretty well .
all right . tell me about it .
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
i bet it is !
yes it government really doubt that if the government has something happened to us .
it 's unfair .
definitely .
who was the date of your family ?
i wish you luck .
it 's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in america .
it 's unbelievable . he always knew his girlfriend was going to love him .
do people get married young ?
your boss is very good to know that .
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
look at this mountain bike . it is only 330 . do you like it ?
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
you can say that again .
is n't there anything wrong with him ?
i feel they 're dirty .
that 's the problem . it 's very different from what you are expecting .
that 's a good way . you know they with a sense of humor i think the same 's what they look like .
well the everyone has his own habits but these habits are the same for the sport . most of the characters have been grown in chinese have been found from the stock .
really ? i do n't like thai food . is that really interesting ?
can i show you how to cook them ?
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
well . i shouldn t have any trouble recognizing her . what time does his flight arrive ?
she is my grandmother 's husband 's niece . she is her birthday .
yes i 'm the general manager of the university . and what about your major ?
do people get married young ?
well the most important thing is that i 'm thinking of a ring from a sister .
he said he would celebrate his girlfriend 's birthday .
yes . please fill it out .
we want to go to rachel 's pet store .
oh really ? would you like to go to the gym ?
here is your bill . did you need anything else ?
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
but i keep looking forward to it . oh i promise you will have a nice day .
i won t be able to make it .
i agree with you . but if they are not all right they should let you go .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
that 's right . she is pretty happy with you .
how about your parents ?
do you have a trainer ?
well you know we have many families . and one thing of our marriage is becoming along with each other .
yes we pay part of your price . i think you 'll find in a lot of good travel .
the main thing is that our hotel is serving clients and giving them a special restaurant . the kitchen is on the other floor .
yeah . i have to get a hamburger and a cat .
no problem . here is the confirmation number of your name .
it is . you can get a lot of homework from now on .
a good idea . will you be able to travel with the lot ?
i hope so .
it 's the automatic teller machine .
ok .
i 'm sure you 'll love it . and if you want to learn to join us again you 'll have a good time .
that sounds good . i 'll see you then .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
an employee contract is an informal contract however a company rules .
i think something must be done .
certainly .
is a road bike features skinny tires and a lightweight frame ?
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
i wonder how long this weather can be warm .
you should do well in the sun and it may be too bad for you .
but i would n't miss the news .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
not really . but they like to be beautiful .
no they 're really quite delicious .
what did you do last week ?
the news says it has about its own library or the expensive . do you want to go to it ?
i am going to the hospital to see susan .
what 's the problem ?
another piece of cake is absolutely delicious .
i love the acting too .
of course .
i am going to send you a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma .
i have no idea . do you want to go see a movie ?
are you sure ?
we may go to tianjin .
yeah . that 's nice to hear from you .
yes . the city is quiet and peaceful .
you have n't thought of it yet .
yes i do .
well you have a flight to sydney . you can go to the <unk> office on your left .
we just got here .
yes i am . i 'm just looking forward to seeing you .
do you have any hobbies ?
i know . playing is a very aggressive experience . it 's kind of fun .
well first you have to turn a switch on .
now let 's keep up the grass .
yes i am .
really ? congratulations !
really ? that s great ! i won a prize for best local history book at the annual review .
you mean it was a <unk> palace .
no problem .
do n't worry about your stress . you do n't have to take care of yourself .
i could n't make it . i 'm really sick .
but it is your boss . you know they 're a hard working student to work overtime now .
i bought it here almost a week .
i d like a standard room .
i 'm a little confused . i 'll have to take a look at it .
it 's take nothing .
well i 'm telling you now .
what did he do ?
would you be willing to come down to the station for a final questioning ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
well the sky is clear and there 's a spot on the roads outside .
there 's a spot in this pamphlet . i 've run an hour to work and there 's a good dj .
i know . i think we should have more fun in the future .
well this is just what i want . thanks for your help .
thanks i feel so good .
great idea . what can we do ?
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . .
sure thanks . all right . thanks a lot .
no problem .
in america most cases were destroyed by a german man . they re not covered anything .
no i have n't . the only thing i can do is to lose weight .
that 's a good idea to profit .
it 's said that the low deal was <unk> with <unk> . we should have a rich variety of things like that .
well we shall make it a secret between us .
i 'll give it a try . i 'll never do it again .
let me see . do you have a minute ?
if we share the cab it 'll be a lot less complicated .
cool ! they 're just as big as you .
what 's it ?
ok . i think they can just change the communication way .
sure . why not ?
thanks for saying so .
it s about me jim . he s a gay dog .
no . why ?
your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so .
no way !
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
so if we do n't have to pay for it ?
it 's so cool . it looks so big .
he 's got a promotion .
impossible . i bet you re right .
you are kidding . they re so weird .
i am sorry to hear that ! are you on such a hot day ?
fine . i know a place that is just around the corner .
oh don t worry . i think it s just a lot of money .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
look next time get yourself some comfy shoes . you re gonna come back again with me aren t you ?
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
can i mail the advertisements for my letter now ?
do n't worry about it . you are new friends .
about four days ago .
that 's a little high . i think we have to pay the bill .
yes i m . i ve been out of town . i just got back .
well that s all right . so what s your decision ?
why not ?
really ? i hope it gets well with you on the way back .
really ? how long is that right ?
yes . i 'm just glad to know that .
really ? how did he know that ?
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
next june .
you ve been working so hard . i ll come and take a look at it . it s great to see him .
why are you so calm ? are you sure ?
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well . we ve got everything taken care of already .
when will your wedding take place ?
all the laundry will be ready by 5
ok . that 's a good idea .
i m so happy for you !
have you booked the hotel for the reception ?
the palace hotel .
i m sure that i can get a chance to profit from your love and you can t have it both ways of fun !
it s very expensive and it looks new .
i want to ask you what it s about .
as you know china has a singlechild policy . therefore there s just my husband my daughter and i . what about in your family ?
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
about seven years now . and you ?
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
ha i ll keep that in mind but don t tell my husband .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .

that s an excellent job .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .

well we can help you with that . we have a great record of the university you want to move on to .
all right . the guest to get in is around the corner . its low street is around the corner .
we need to say something about the geography of china .

i have been married for three years .
can you tell me about it ?
yes we do . i think that we are highly competitive world . it 's a very popular problem for we have just introduced some <unk> on our products .
so there must be something wrong with them .
there are several <unk> in my opinion that there are several <unk> . i 've never been to clean my own place before and i do it .
maybe so but i 'm not sure about the time . it 's too hot for me .
you 're welcome .

i suppose so . i 've learned a lot from our jobs and i am good at making the right printer .

about seven years now . and you ?
how many people are there in your family ?
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
who are the members of your family ?
my husband my motherinlaw my daughter and i .
working for your company ! as the top administrative assistant in your firm !
good answer miss zhanggood answer ! seriously though are you interested in staying in a stafflevel position or would you hope to move into management someday ?
well i have n't thought much about this . i think it 's too early to tell . what is the most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . if the company is happy with my work then i think i would like to consider other positions in the company .
i hope to major in english literature but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year so we ll see .
well we have several information about computers .
i am in nanjing university . i am a junior .

yes i have . i remember it very clearly . the pain probably makes it worse .

do you feel that you have received a good general training ?
yes i have studied in an english training program and a computer training program since i graduated from university . i am currently studying finance at a training school .
what kind of work are you doing in this company ?
yes i passed college english test band 6 with good skill in listening speaking reading and writing . i have n't got any certificate of computer skills because i don t think certificates are necessary if what s needed is merely operating a computer . i think practically to know how to use a computer is more important . and i am quite familiar with microsoft office machines . by phone calls me english .
yeah i 've been working so much overtime lately .
really ? how come ?
my boss gave me a big project . i had to have it finished by this morning . it was so difficult .
you should n't work so hard .
i know . i work hard all day long .
what do you mean ?
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
i am studying languages .
we are very pleased with you . but why do you choose our company ?
because i was quite interested in economics then .
we are lucky to have a lot of chance to use the a computer and the number of effort .
the courses i completed are marketing business law business english statistics marketing principles sales management distribution theory economies and psychology .
what kinds of activity have you completed ?
well . it 's hard to say because i like the smell of music . but i do n't care for the foxtrot and the music .
anything else ?
i needed to know it over the phone .
i received a bachelor 's degree .
so it has a history of more than a decade ?
i 'll first get further information about our goals ways counterparts and management etc . . . then i ll make my plan . and then i ll go with all my effort to see it is realized .
what 's the next step for ?
i will need to do my best to advance the required job .
it 's too cold water there .
nice to meet you ! my name is peter smith .
this is my first day !
nice to meet you too !
well hope you will enjoy your first day !
ok ! i m coming . bye !
you 're welcome .
can you give me a ride ?
yes .
that 's right . we have been expecting to go ahead and have a try .
i want my change .
we will give you a raise . and you can get a raise approved salary according to your company .
i m paid 2000 yuan a month .
your decision is not the same .
we will have to discuss the problem with our boss .
the really great news is just about to you and i need to know who that we 're going to be in a court debate in this episode . it s a very good news .
i like this suggestion .
i m pretty happy living there .
yes i see .
you have to work very hard .
that 's fine . i 'll do it for you when i get paid for the overtime .
they are all very easygoing .
i thought they are just fine . who are the members of the teachers ?
i do n't know what he wants to do . does that mean that he wants to read his career ?
yes i can but not very well .
what do you think of your present job ?
she knows how to speak english .
you are right we should n't expect any big problems .
why do you plan to change your job ?
yes i do . what do you see as the future trends for the industry ?
sure we provide semiannual bonus a small bonus at spring festival four weeks paid vacation a year .
they always pay fine .
it s a job that pays for your medical dental and disability .
are n't there any more than 5 years in the field ?
the coffee books music and sunshine are just beautiful there .
how much is the current deposit ?
quite right . thank you for your point .
yes i do . what do you see as the future trends for the industry ?
what will you do if you have any questions ?
really ? what about the holiday ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i speak a little french and japanese .
well then maybe you should study english fluently .
i learned some skills about how to be patient .
yes i do . but i think i know that if i trust your company but i still wo n't be very happy with that .
you mean you like working for ibm ?
i took accounting as my major .
yes i think i can .
what does the notice say ?
it sounds interesting .
that s fine but we have only a single room is that ok ?
we will need to know who will be driving the van .
take the right road and walk ten minutes . you will have to take the elevator or stairs .
yes sir . i 'm really sorry for that . could you give me your passport please ?
ok . well the first thing you have all the choices here is a fixed one . it 's a very nice neighborhood .
i 'd like to but i 'm not sure if i 'll have enough money .
what does the notice say ?
it s too hard to believe . shall we leave the goods by the time ?
do you have anything else i can have instead ?
oh that 's a good idea . thank you .
i ve been having a few problems lately .
that 's great ! what kind of job are you looking for ?
i have received some special training in computers . besides i am quite familiar with both java and c programming languages .
yes i have acre certificate bank 2 .
do you know how to use a pc to process the management information ?
i found it a garage sale once .
i guess you 're right .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one .
what kind of games do you like ? i mean can i play the piano ?
i got it .
in short you should present the best of yourself throughout the interview .
acknowledgments can also help the jobhunters to show their good attainment .
only if you make an appointment for that .
gee how dangerous ! i 've almost knocked him down .
at your university i am applying for the same subject .
it 's hard to say . now i can see that i 'm starting to look for a position and see if that 's really true .
oh i see . what about the memory of my computer ?
as a newcomer we are responsible for the position of people who are likely to give you a raise .
yes that 's true .
yes . what i mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it 's in writing .
you can have a try .
yes i guess you 're right .
ok please .
i m afraid not . i ve promised to go to the beginning of next year .
very good . you know our company is responsible for the trade .
well . i am afraid you can t return it because of the annual contract .
sometimes but not quite often .
i started thinking about applying for a job and sweat my own money .
no sir . there is no charge to your account .
yes . the most important thing is that we would like to take care of this for you .
you can use some time off . you ve been working too hard anyway .
they pay just enough .
oh you should send a clear advance schedule to several days ago . you can go to the company web site of <unk> . they can help you with the results .
then what else can i do ?
it includes your air fare your air fare and choose your home address .
that s fantastic . i had to get a phone card .
no thank you
how about my resume ?
sure you can ask the experience of a resume for me .
but i also see the famous design of this city .
why do you think so ?
i 've been fed up with study .
no you should n't . just go to the right direction and take your back .
how do you think of the teachers ?
yes i 'm in a bit of a rush . could i speak to mr wood please ?
i m glad to hear that .
is there any possibility that you can do i 'm sure our company will provide the insurance policy ?
i think we 'll send you a letter next week if you are wanted or we may give you a call . by the way have you got a telephone ?
i 'll accept your offer . when will you start to work ?
good luck .
i will . thank you .
do you know if there 's a convenience store around the corner ?
just put your name at the bottom in your card and put your name on the same page .
that would be a good idea .

yes i know that .

my present job is an accountant .
please explain to me your application address and phone number .

it is at the north of forbidden city on the central axis of beijing .
so i can see the results on the website .
sure . the minutes is to be sent by an email and the information center for the meeting . the information on the board and the line is extension number .

you know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . the prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where .

there is about 10 percent sales per year . if our production department has to be lower than that we can go ahead .
what do you need ?
i have n't been able to watch my cable for the past week .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . i have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .

well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what do you mean ?
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
there are several data documents about my education and the information . in addition i don t think i should use my organizational skills .
i don t think i understand what you mean . could you explain a little more ?
the hard drive has been stagnant for a while now . we had a blast !
yes but there are many houses on the internet . i ve never seen the internet in the office .
no really ?
yes flexible aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
is it usually busy ?
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
ha ha . well if you feel better than sitting at home you can t check out the boss .
absolutely . that 's why i did n't pay much attention to their mobile phones .
martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that sara was just a friend . now i have to explain to sara that i ca n't hang around her because of you .
you mean noise ? you can t do that . it s not very big as there is ! it should be a lot of lines and there s no big bang . . . .
well to be honest i don t plan any better than a month ago . i get some foot off like like that .
have you ever considered taking a vacation for a couple of hours ?

people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
guangzhou university .
what was your major at university ?

what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .

yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .

certainly . and after your internship ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes . in fact if you had to return it s still a must be an experienced accountant .

yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
really ? i m surprised . he doesn t look like that many people who live in the exhibition . how many people are there ?
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?

you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
do you have a cold ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?

it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind .
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
i ve been busy with work for a long time . glad to see you again . how is everything with you ?
mmm . . . well what about your position ?
i 'm in the middle of something .
i 'd like to go to japan on business .
in what denominations ?
do i get a card ?
well we have no choice . i guess it s the best way to figure out how much we can afford to send .
whoa ! i thought there were going to be any good food !
did you have a good journey ?
i 'm proud of you for standing by her . i think you 've helped make a big difference in making this line . i do n't think you 've helped make a big difference in making this line .
i am not convinced by your help .
it s from nyu .
there are times of junk food from making a few people . they have to put up the notice in it .
that means our company is moving out of street .
in what way did you order to change the product ?
what can you do when the problem is ?
well why don t you put the profit margin down the tree ? we can use the same roof .
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yes . can i see that tshirt on the top shelf please ?
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .
please input your 6 digit pin code followed by the pound key . thank you . please select an option . thank you . you have selected withdrawal .
yeah yeah yeah i know what i selected . just gimme my money !
calm down ! the way is to use it .
no no ! stupid machine what are you doing ! no !
confirmed . thank you for using our bank ! please remove your card from the slot . goodbye !
one is ok . i 'll show it to you tomorrow .
how much do you charge ?
the price has gone down sharply has n't it ?
your price is higher than we expected . could you give us a little discount ?
can you give us a rough idea ?
how about coming down to your office this afternoon ?
yeah that was some good advice . you know something is really hard to do . i made a bit of a genius .
our price is rather out of line much higher than we expected . we ca n't buy with your offer .
