i 'm not sure . he is a very nice guy and very considerate .
you are so thoughtful .
i 'll be late for school . i 'll get a parttime job this afternoon .

i am going to take an additional course in some places where i want to go to this bank .

what are you talking about ? it s a good idea to start with !
i will do it ! if you put this under the sign i will show you how to do it .
i know . ok i am ready .
yes you have to turn right on and this machine will show you how to use it .
so what about that one over here ? it will really hurt me .
it 's a little too <unk> . do you want to have a try ?
cool . so it s cool and it fits me like i can just throw everything in the dryer for a while .
yes but you will have to put up the dryer too .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
i 'm sorry but i have to be going to be up a minute .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
how could you do that ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again .
i 'm sure you 'll like that . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'm going to work .
i think you 'll make it .
it 's only about 10 minutes walk .
ok . i 'll go and get it for you .
yeah i know that . but it seems that i 'm a good student . and i have to go to the gym as soon as possible .
i know what you mean . i wo n't do anything about it .
i 'm not sure . let 's go to a disco after dinner .
i think the best way to go to the university .
ok . i 'll be back in a minute .
no . i do n't want to be in the mood for your exam .
i know . i 'm always very good at this .
i 'm sorry . i did n't know you had such an exam .
about fourteen .
that 's too bad .
i hope so .
i 'd like to open a new account .
that 's a good idea . do you want to get a new one ?
that 's a good idea . i want to be able to play some music on my computer and chat with my friends .
well if you want to be outside you can start using <unk> or play a music player and listen to music .
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
yes you do .
awesome !
yes i did .
i m sorry sir . it s only a minute .
it s a chilly day . can you put on a small plan ?
i am glad you know that . it 's just one of those things .
good . come in this office .
it is . but i am not sure about the color .
it 's lovely but you 'd better choose your used textbooks . it 's a bit pricey though .
i don t like the color .
yes . i m sure it will .
i m sure you ll like it . how about this one ? it s made of wool and wool clothing .
yes it is . but i think you should give it a very cool one .
but if you want to look at this shoe you can easily get a bigger one .
what about this one ? it 's a very nice dress .
yes i do . i need to buy some new clothes too .
you can pay it on cash or credit card .
thanks . i m sorry to hear that .
it 's great !
you 're right . i 'll be right back .
no . i think it 's already included in the rent .
i know what you mean . i think i 'll go with the sweater .
what about the kitchen ?
it s a great idea . the kitchen god tells me about the benefits of the house .
oh it s a bit expensive but we don t have any house in the garden too .
well i think we should just have a different carpet . the market is always crowded .
that 's a good idea .
yes it is .
i m glad you re enjoying it .
it depends on how you want to travel . if you want to live in the country you will have to pay each month .
that s way too much .
how much do you want to spend ?
i m glad you re enjoying it .
that 's not a problem .
that s a good idea .
that s not a bit .
i just went to the store and lost my bag .
i m not sure if i ll be in the mood .
yes i do . i like cooking very much .
i don t like it . it takes up too much time . you really should put some kind of dishes .
i ll put all the presents under the tree . and we can keep the cup of tea towel for you .
i know . i am really glad you could come to my shop .
i like chinese food . i can recommend you some . it 's my favorite dessert .
you ve been learning how to make asian food .
yes i do . i m sure you ll have a good cook . it s very delicious .
yeah i know . i used to buy some candies but since i was expensive i don t buy any food at the new health center . since i had to try them i think it 's much cheaper than international food i never had a small piece of food .
i think about ten minutes .
here is your bill .
yes . i want to have a pair of white shirts made in your latest silk .
i am not sure .
i think you re right . this is a very expensive dress but it 's already expensive .
you re right . this is a very expensive dress but it s very expensive .
hey i m not sure . let s go for a drink .
that s right . i m going to buy some new clothes for my children .
i think they 're quite a bit . how much is the price ?
here you are .
i want a pair of shoes .

i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
oh thank you . i 'm just going to let you go .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
that s a very nice place .
ok i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
you can pick up some of the houses you want .
ok . let s go !
what are you looking for ?
i could n't agree with you more .
oh my god . we have a few rooms available for tonight . would you like a quiet evening ?
i want to put it in the storage area .
i know but it 's a little tight .
i am sure you will find a good price .
just one .
well you should come and talk to your manager and let me know .
ok .
what are you going to do ?
i can do that .
it 's a bit chilly in place . i can go to the bathroom in the basement .
i can t believe it !
let 's go to the top of the tree .
thank you .
it s a soft case .
this is the property manager . may i take a message ?
hi . this is amy . what can i do for you ?
oh how nice of you .
i would be happy to .

yes it is . it 's much more than the bus .
i am going to need a deposit certification to handle the affairs related to home .
what did you do ?
well i have no idea what you are talking about .
yes .
i 'm afraid i ca n't find the right one .
yes . if you want to live in the student house you have to return . besides you can get a job that can get a job that is much better .
well i think it 's much better than the bus .
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple .
i think i can save that . i do n't want macintosh .
that 's a problem . you can go to a pc . the computer will tell you the options are free of the service .
well i have a problem with your university but i 'm sure you 'll like it .
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
i 'm afraid i ca n't find the right one .
that 's a good idea . you can go to the university of china to make sure that your university will suit your needs in the uk .
yes i 'm from taiwan .
do you know where you 're from ?
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
i can help you with that . what is your favorite computer for you ?
i need to think of some advice before i can collect some free souvenirs .
i know . but if you ask around other people will tell you what they say .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
no problem .
how do you want your hair cut ?
no i have n't .
i 'm not sure i have to do that .
i 'd like a single please .
how about your hair ?
i am afraid it 's too cold .
what do you want to know ?
i think i 'm going to wear it for a while .
i 'm glad you could help me . i 'm very hungry and i 'd like to do some things for you .
yes please . you 'd better cut the sides of this .
here is your key sir . if you need anything just dial 0 on your room .

ok . i 'll take it .
yes we do . it 's very nice of you to come here .
how about this one ? it 's our biggest 16 in diameter .
i 'm sorry . i 'll bring it back to you right away .
i think the weather is nice .
oh i see . you 're right . but you 're right .
what 's the problem ?
where is it ?
i really want to paint the walls right away .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
that is a great idea .
yes it did . we were lucky for it . we were hoping that we could put a sandwich together sometime .
i guess so .
i know that it is . we can also use a new home .
how long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?
that 's a great idea . i can bring you a new one .
it s a good idea to have a small house . it would be a good idea to buy .
i have n't heard of that yet .
you 're right . they are the two of the two .
i have to work .
where is it ?
i think it 's much better than doing it when you get back from the doctor 's department .
but we ca n't find anything in the house .
i think that would be great .
i am not used to cook that !
what do you think ?
i 'd like to try chinese food .
yes . i like it very much .
yes i have been to the states .
i think you should have a try .
i like the fish .
certainly sir . for our reference you also know more about the payment and of course the 20 would be 750 .
not yet . i 'm not hungry until midnight .
do you like some soup ?
thank you . i 'll try some canadian .
i 've never had one before . i 'd like to try that indian .
i 'm glad you could come to my shop next time .
you are right . chinese is more important than chinese .

we have lots of things . you see i 've got a new project to do . i 'm in a hurry and i do n't have a child so i 'd like to help you .

when do you begin to leave ?
there are different kinds of books such as postcards and ones . i also like to see them .
i know . i am really interested in this position .
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
i think you should save more . if you are a little more expensive i 'll buy some clothes for you .
yes . i have a friend who lives in that neighborhood .
do you have a trainer ?
well if you go to the airport you can just pick up your keys and baggage that s it .
i see . so why did you decide to leave the company ?
yes . when was the last date ?
i 'm glad you do n't want to . i want to have a good time here .
the fee is 25 every time you overdraft .

i 'm sure you 'll find it .
i 'm sure you 'll love them .
well i guess i can t have that money .
well i guess i can give you credit for the products .
i 'm afraid not . i 'm actually a tough customer here . i 'm sure i 'll be able to fit the deadline .
i know . i have to talk to you about the sales staff in the company . they are very busy right now .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you . we are n't going to have to be able to pay more than that .
here you are .
thank you .
i will . thanks .
i 'm not sure if you 'll like it .
sure what do you want me to do ?
i want to know about this year s election .
do i have any other choices ?
could you get a few seconds ?
anything else ?
oh have you taken a walk around ?
i do n't think so . but the chinese think is as good as the food is good as the inspection system is for us .
yeah i know . but if i were you i would n't have gotten a raise .
come on ! it s my turn ! you can just wash the vegetables and i ll make it !
what ? you mean a jellyfish ? it s a little too small for me to eat .
i know . i think i know . i do n't like the third one . it 's a very beautiful neighborhood .
yeah i guess it 's the same with me .
i guess that 's just because i did n't know my mom was seriously ill .
no i did n't . i 'm in a hurry .
yes i do . i have to study at a university .
that 's a great question ! it 's really a hard question !
i usually go to the cafeteria .
yeah right . it s not the best coffee i ve ever tried . i m sure you ll have a good rest !
yeah i know . i 've got to buy some fruit at least and some new fruit .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like . classical music might make you clever but dance might make you livelier and happier .
well we usually go to the cafeteria .
haha ! i also got a sweet and sweet little french . would you like to drink with me ?
i think most people do . it 's much cheaper than chinese .
what do you think of a big vacation ?
i do n't like it . i do n't like it .
yes . i am hungry and bought all the other dishes . i could n't eat any meat but i am afraid i have to ask them to .
i like the fish .
i am going to do the same thing with you .

i 'm not sure yet .
i 'm not sure . i do n't know what to order .

i ca n't .
i guess so . i 'm sure i 'll get used to it .
that 's pretty good . it was n't a bit expensive but it was worth it .

i 'm in the mood for some games .
i 'm in the mood for a beer .
what kind of music do you like ?
not really . they 're probably going to cut down on more pictures .
yes . i m pretty lucky . i ve always wanted to be able to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
i think that maybe you should try looking at the new concert .
i do n't know . i think we have a good time here .
do you like it ?
yeah . it makes me feel that i can change the beginning .
she 's a bit tired .
i think that she had a litter too much of her punch .
no i 'm not . i 'm a bit shy .
yes i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives there .
i 'm afraid i ca n't find the right one .
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
well i ve been playing football since i was a child .
really ? what happened ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
do you think you 'll ever get a passport ?
well that was the least i wanted to say . . .

i do n't think so .
i was robbed last night .
hello tracy . i can help you as an document for this .

that 's great . i 'll take it .
no problem . i 'll take some too .
i 'm glad to meet you .
what time is it ?
no but i ended up finding out later that night when i saw her with another girl at a club near my home .
i think she had a very good vision . they worked at us for quite a few years .
i 'm so happy for you .
yes . she is my teacher 's teacher .
i had a few coffees while i was waiting .
i think that that s a bunch of nonsense . it s a good idea to have a child but i think the parents had a lot of money to do it .
she asked me to stay in bed for a long time .
it was n't too bad . you certainly went up and have been a wonderful time !
you 're welcome .
i will . do you want me to bring anything ?

yes it is . it has been handed down in the paper for a few days since then it is .
it 's really a good system . i 'm getting a little nervous now . i 'm really tired and i have to finish this project .
well how about this one ? it 's a secret .
that 's great . i ca n't wait to check the local channel .
because i think it 's dangerous .
what 's it like ?
i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
yes i agree . i should follow your advice .
it 's just around the corner .
what happened ?
it starts at 8

i know what you mean . i am thinking of going to a party .
what do you think of the new year 's eve ?
they re both very fashionable you know .
no fireworks are awesome !

i do n't know . i have to pay for it .
what a pity !

it 's a piano <unk> .
no way ! i want to save it .
yes . and you also know driving a new car .
what kind of software can you use ?
yes .
wow that sounds really good . anything else ?
you should just use your computer .
in a formal interview .
i 'm going to try that sir .
how about going to a concert ?
we hope you will have a big dinner party .
you can always tell him about him .
thank you !
well the state will be up for a thorough market . the economy of this business will allow you to teach us to get a discount .
it 's 100 dollars .
what about the surrounding area ?
i am going to need my money back .
if you do that 's a very small amount you can pay by yourself .
ok . let 's go .
so what 's in your bag ?
well you should look the interviewer in the eye so as you can see that on your face .
what 's it about ?
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance to take them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
well the thing is that the climate is so much more slip . so the car is always so fresh .
i do n't know . i do n't know .
how do you know that the fax machine is almost broken ?
i do n't think so . the thing is that he did is .
well i 've got all the key points for around here in the factory . i 'd like to have a rest of us to work on in the factory .

i 'm sorry . i 'll bring you a cloth immediately .
i think i might have them if i can understand why .

i went to play tennis in the public park .
did you see the <unk> of the table ?
no i did n't .
did you vote today ?
no but i 'm sure i 'll get used to it .
do you have any other positions available ?
i 'm sorry to hear that .
i 'm very glad to hear that .
i 'm sure you 'll love them .
i think you should make some oatmeal and toast .
no .
well i 'm afraid i have to go . the plane will arrive soon . so i need to take a bus .
yes i 've been out of work for a long time . my family really pays off .
i 'm glad to see you again .
i 'm not sure . i like the music and waltz .
do you like dance ?
i like chocolate and the best .
no i do n't like playing it at all .
oh yeah . i ca n't wait to play the piano well .
oh i see .
are the really interesting leader ?
yes . the ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth and they have developed into a festival filled with a variety of people .
is it the same in america ?
absolutely . as before the main issue of the <unk> of the lamb we do n't have to drink any supper .
that 's great !
i do n't know .
is n't that the only thing that you are looking to be a <unk> that 's why the feel so unfit for the job ?
ok . it 's a basketball match .
i know . i m pretty good at it .
i think the best way to go for the first two weeks . so i can do half a kilo in the afternoon .
that 's great . i like the dance club .
ok . let 's go .
oh really ? i 've seen that before .
do you like dancing ?
yes i 'm a very good singer but i 'm very familiar with it .
yeah you re a pretty good friend .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate pop .
do you want to play poker ?
yes .
how about your hair ?
of course i can .
i really want to know about this for a long time .
yes i do .
you 're in luck !
i think it 's too noisy .
it 's a job at a recruitment agency .
but i think the color is too bright .
yes she 's fine .
i 'm afraid you 're right .
to a disco ?
i 'll play with him .
oh yeah . i remember it .
it 's very nice .
i 'm sure you 'll like it .
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and my head is n't very much .
oh my god . you dance beautifully too .
oh really ? how did you learn that ?
thanks for flattering me . i think you dance a lot right ?
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes .
i 'm not sure . i like the music and waltz .
yeah you are right . i can teach you how to play the piano well .
do n't mention it .
ok .
i like baseball the best .
in that case i do n't believe my mom did it .
no sir . the tax is included .
oh i see . since i 'm a heavy smoker may i have one ?
of course ! i ca n't wait to see it .
what are the sources of energy ?
yes it is . but it 's already warm .
i 'm afraid i ca n't find it there .
that 's a good idea . it 's a lot of work .
what about a mac ?
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring best .
i 'm glad you like it .
i m sure you ll find the perfect apartment on the top of the market . there is also a nice view from the balcony .
i know . it 's very nice of you to say so .
yes it is . but i 'm not sure whether it 's like this when it 's a cold weather .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you .
i know . i 'm not used to this city . i 'm not too cold for winter .
it 's always warm in june july and august .
is it always cold in chicago and boston ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i can understand why you can return it .
yes it 's so pleasant .
we can still go to the park in the morning . we can have a good time here .
i hope it stays warm .
ok . i 'll wash them for you .
yes . i think it 's supposed to be sunny as soon as possible .
yes i am .
what 's your major ?
i know . i 'm really sorry about that .
i 'm glad you could come to see me .
you 're welcome .
i think you should save more .
it 's a pleasure .
i 'm going to get it .
of course .
i 'm afraid i have to go to the airport to pick up some medicine for my aunt . he said he had to be angry about our meeting .
i 'm not sure yet .
i 'm afraid i have to go now .

it 's not a very good job to keep your desk neat and <unk> .
what 's wrong with it ?
i 'm not sure .
how about the cost of the hardcover ?
it 's a skill . it 's only a few weeks ago .
i 'm sure you 'll love it .
it 's true . some of my life is one of the most miserable technology and it 's so different .
what else is wrong with it ?
i 'm not sure .
i know .
no thank you .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i do n't have to .
i know . it s not like that . it s just a lot of noise and it s almost noon . i m sorry .
i 'm afraid i have n't got a raise .
what did he do ?
he is all right .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
yes he 's too old to believe in that type of things . but he s got a fever and a fever .
you re welcome .
you re welcome . i was glad to help .
i will . see you then .
i 'm a bit tired . i 'm really tired .
did he really get to him ?
yes he is . he s very fond of you .
he is really good .
i 'm not sure yet .
you really did a fabulous job .
but you 're new to live in this house with your parents .
i 'd love to .
i ca n't believe that . why did you ask that ?
i 'd like to . but i 'm afraid i have to be going now .

i 'm so happy for you !
i 'd be glad to . . . . . i 'd like to go to that .
i 'm afraid i ca n't come back to beijing right now .
i know . i think i 'm getting used to it .
that 's good . do you think you 'll be able to work overtime and take it easy ?
i think you should save more . you can get more rest .
yes . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . we have many trees but few of the trees have been causing global warming .
we have reduced emission of them . we have been to cars for ten years .
i 'm afraid i have n't got much of a chance to see a movie .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there are many famous paintings in it .
yes it was very interesting . the director of the school has had several years of experience in the science field .
oh yeah ?
yes . if you want to .
i know . i am a grownup .
do you think we should be talking about him ?
do n't you think so ?
yes i do .
i am terribly sorry about that . but i have to finish this report by tomorrow .
wow . so it certainly did n't come up .
yes .
well you can come to the right place . we can have them in the front of you .
i think you 'll love this !
you know what ? you 're working for so hard .
you should take some medicine and make some baits and borrow some nail polish for example when you go to the hospital .
i will . do you want me to put anything on the list ?
i know . i 'm really into that kind of trouble .
thank you very much .
you said it .

oh i see .
i know . it was a great game .
yes they did .
oh god ! i ca n't bear it ! i 've never seen the crowds !
they 're incredibly selfish . they re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that i have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep !
yes that s exactly what i wanted .
i m really not sure . i ve never bought one . it s a very good one .
yes i do . i need to get my id card .
you ve been shopping for a week ?

she is expecting .
i 'm so happy for you .
tom that lucky guy .
he is fine . he retired last week . he s been on a business trip for three years .
he did n't make any sense .
he is fine .
but she did and made me disappointed .
he 's been late for work twice .
sounds like you 're right .
to be honest with you jason we are really happy with your performance .
i do n't know . he 's a liar .
i know . it 's hard to say . but it 's still early for us to forget .
are you aware that all the evidence points to you ?
i like to play table tennis with my friends .
that 's great . she is a tough team .
she must be deaf .
i think you 're making a fuss . her husband 's ca n't accept that .
i 'd be glad to !
i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to .
i 'll go and get a shopping cart .
i 'm not used to it .
well you can come and talk to me then .
i 'm not going to put this off any worse .
ok . see you then .
i know . i still have done something but i really should tell him .
i was taking a walk in the park early this morning .
thanks a lot .
you know that he s been having a hard time since he was a boy .
you were really lucky .
that s the end of the world .
yes . and not expensive either .
ok . . . .
i have no idea .
oh i see .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
what 's the price for a single room ?
i had a terrible quarrel with him .
i 'm sorry .
thank you .
yes he does . he loves his taste .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
nothing much . i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
how long do you have to stay ?
i went to paris .
he told me that i 'm very happy with the sales .
i see .
i was turned down again .
what does his dad say ?
he is an accountant .
i do n't know .
i think you 'll like it .
i 'll beat him .
i 'm sorry .
he said that i 'm very pleased with your work .
i think you should be very shy .
he is a very good guy . he s always on the way to the right person .
i think he 's going to be an hour late .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell you the truth i am on the diet .
maybe he is just a bit nervous .
no i do n't think so .
i know . i have to work hard .
i think that they are very shy .
i think he 's very lucky actually .
oh really ? what happened ?
that 's great !
thank you .
well in a way i think we should be more careful . some words are very different from the world .
he said he had to get rid of it .
oh dear . i guess we can t do this .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i have to go to the ladies to write a letter of credit .
don t worry about that . it s probably of the stress you ve been under . just take these days .
here is your bill . do you need anything else ?
i 'm on a diet .
oh really ? then what about your mother ?
i feel terrible .
maybe . but they are just different .
well i ve always been good for a long time . if i had n't studied you probably would have time to make some chinese food .
she 's terribly sorry about that . she 's going to have to leave the office suddenly and wo n't be able to come back to office by then . she hopes you again .
yeah . they can make it .
i think that maybe you should invite him over to dinner .
well we have a good variety of chinese antiques and porcelain . do you like it ?
i 'm sorry . i did n't quite catch what you wanted .
you know that i fell in love with you .
i 'm so glad i did n't notice it .
you did n't know that you did n't .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm very glad that you came to my office .
i 'm sorry . i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell me what .
i 'm sorry . i did n't know that .
it 's so hard .
come on it 's not like that . they are always being friends .
it must be kate .
i do n't think so . he never did a thing but when he did it happen .
i do n't think so . he never did a perfect job .
i don t think so .
but i like you more than your chinese people .
yes . i have some that style .
you can always try to avoid <unk> when you talk to her about time .
i am not really sure .
how about your party ?
yes . she is my wife and father .
thanks a lot .
he s a very good player .
i 'm sure you 'll like it .
thank you .
not too bad . it 's been pretty busy .
what did you do there ?
oh my father mother mother mother mother and me .
how old is your brother ?

i 'm afraid i have n't got much of a hurry .
it 's a <unk> . it 's a <unk> .

i do n't think we 'll have much more to do . the accident was n't done .
i understand .
yes . you can pay by credit card or credit card .
i think that 's a good idea . you can get a lot of money in this country .
it is not the correct thing . you will have to maintain our company and expand our business quickly .
i want to become an <unk> in a <unk> field of journalism i want to enjoy what i am doing .
oh really ? that 's cool .
no i have n't had time to look for rent .
i 'm sure you 'll be in good shape .
i know . but if you 're hungry then you 'll have to go to the movies .
that 's right . they 're so nice .
i guess that 's true . it 's a nasty habit . i ca n't think why you 're so <unk> .
i know . but it 's hard to find a place to live in a house that 's flat .
i know . i 'm a bit more professional . i 'm flat broke and i have to work on my own .
i 'm not sure . do you know anyone has his wife ?
do you have a dog ?
my mom said i should have a baby so i have to wait for a while .
that 's great . it seems that you really need to learn how to speak your son .
it 's true . it 's highly esteemed among you .
sounds interesting !
i have n't heard anything about the olympic games and the organizational structure is the most intelligent .
i know that . i think that 's a good idea . i think i should get rid of some new clothes in taiwan .
it 's true . it 's a traditional family . i can also recall the young people 's world .
well i guess i 'm lucky to learn so much .
i 'm sure i 'll be the top one that i did n't know . i 'm a bit worried about my courses . i have a parttime job and some training . i 'm always taught in the it .
are you sure ? what is he ?
he is really nice and challenging .
oh i m so sorry .
what is that ?
i know . i have to go to a us to visit my parents .
well this is my new baby . he s a lot of fun . he s a lot of fun .
it s quite a lot of work to do .
no but i do n't really have any .
you 're right .
wow ! good for you !
well i guess you re right . if you re so competent you will have to work on a heavy industry trip .
she asked me to stay in a different dress .
i 'd be glad to . i could get away from you .
what s the problem ?
do they have to work overtime ?
i think you should make some preparations .
i ve been out of town . i ve been out of town .
that s good . you can go to the movies during the week .
i went to the coast . i love being with a lot of friends .
how long does it take to get to the east market ?
yes . i remember . it was very kind of you to help me .
no i do n't .
oh really ? so you took the weather .
i m fine . i m a lot of fun . i have learned a lot .
i don t know . i don t think i ve ever seen a film that many times .
yeah it s so much fun .
yes i have read the filling instruction carefully since the paper is out of paper i want to read some harmful bacteria in your resume .
how about mahjong ?
i have a couple of times but i usually only have a couple of days in my neighborhood .
you should always listening to some music . you can make some time .
what s that ?
but i m not good at exercise for health .
did you have to take any exams ?
you need to get off at the next stop and drive about one of those jeans .
you know what ? the brazilian team will soon be here in less than three days !
i think we should go out more often .
well i think we should just have more roads built .
what s your idea ?
no i did n't . i just got my makeup and my cds . i m still hungry .
it 's a program about islam . it s very interesting .
right .
well i am a spring team and the young are the best .
yes .
what kind of sport do you like to play ?
what are you playing ?
what do you mean ?
basketball .
well i 'm not sure . i do n't know .
that 's no problem . a regular thing is n't it ?
yeah i guess you 're right . but i just don t know what to do with my own .
i know but i m really lucky .
yeah . i have to get started .
that 's why i 'm so young .
you don t have to . i think you re a good friend .
well i know that . but i do n't have any experiences but i have a problem with the book .
that s true . you can always find a parttime job in a bar near the university .
that s fine . i 'll send a larger to pick you up .
yes . you can also learn a lot from chinese culture .
well in that case i guess i should just watch a couple of minutes . it s not very simple .
that 's true . i just want to enjoy the tour in the afternoon .
who will be coming to ?
yes . i think it 's much better than the bus .
i am really sorry .
i do n't know .
she 's a bit nervous i do n't know .
yes they are .
i 'm sorry but i think you deserve some money .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
i 'm not sure if you 're in the mood for dancing actually .
ok . i 'll call you at your restaurant and we 'll talk about it later .
i do n't think it 's that serious . you should have told her that you were n't so happy .
i could n't agree more . but where are we going to get up ?
did you get your exams again ?
i 'm fine thanks . how are you ?
sorry . they wo n't keep you .
you did n't buy a new computer or a new one ?
and not not that .
i 'm trying to find out about the new apartment .
why don t you try smoking one of the two ?
thank you .
i 'm sorry sir . we will connect you with the room in the room .
it s saturday a great weekend .
what time does the library close ?
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s an anniversary of our weeding .
he 's not young as well . he 's a bit older than me .
i think he 's better got the flu .
i know that . but if you had to pay more attention to your life i think we should find something that really is n't it ?
i know . i 'm going to find a parttime job to increase my income .
you 're right . but i 'm not sure if the manager is satisfied with it .
he had a great time .
what did he say ?
i know . but he probably feels weak . it 's not very obvious . what can he do ?
it was a real red letter .
oh it 's really a surprise .
how could you cheat on her ?
i 'm a teacher .
how long will it take to get back to me ?
oh i see . you mean you do n't have to tell me that you want to be my mom .
i will .
what do you mean by that ?
i think you 'll like it .
come on ! you ca n't have to the reunion of the class .
what 's he doing ?
of course ! i bought you five candies and i 'm just going to be there .
i know . i never thought about that before . it 's a tradition that i do n't have a problem with me .
she must be very careful about her .
yeah . she s a private eye now .
i know . it was a good movie but i 'm sure it would be better to make it .
i know . but i do n't think you are right .
you re right .
well i 'm not sure . . .
what s that ?
i 'm in a really good mood actually .
i 'm so sorry . i did n't know that .
i just got back from a different movie . it was n't my fault .
i do n't know .
no he did n't . his aunt died in the third grade .
and three people ?
i 'm afraid he 'll be back at 300 p . m .
oh we have reached the teacher of advanced technology and the master of china .
yes .
i know . i have to do it every day .
i really did n't do anything .
ok . i 'm coming .

it 's 530 by my watch .
yes it is . you do n't use so much .
do you do the same exercises every day ?
yes it is . i am really looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison .
yes i do . i do n't have to put on the eyedrop and ointment on it .
do you have any hobbies like playing chess ?
i know . but it 's not the best way to avoid them . besides i know regular <unk> women can <unk> the <unk> .
well we could look at the menu first .
good idea . i ll take some too . how about some coffee ?
yes . we should . if we save more money we should buy something for the workers . it will give us a free .
yeah . it was great to see you again .
i 'm not kidding .
yes . i have to stay at home and prepare a supper .

i 'm sorry sir . we have made a reservation for you last night .
great . i 'll come to your house at about five .
you 're welcome .
ok i 'll call you .
i know . it 's not the fault of the company . but it 's the truth .
yes i know . look at these people in the street they are spending on <unk> shifts each day and over here .
yes . there is a party at the shopping mall that 's on the corner .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
thank you .
i 'm sure i 'll be there .
what 's that ?
i see . it 's good to see them .
how much do you think the chinese buffet cost ?
i 'd like to see it . . .
i 'm going to take a few more pictures .
how about painting a month ?
i 'm sure i can .
i 'm sure you will .
he was n't so funny either .
he 's a real wiz on powerpoint .
if he was really poor at me i would be young .
i 'm glad to see you too .
i 'm sorry . i have to leave the li hong kong for half an hour .
oh i see . you take it easy . i will tell you how i feel .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
no i do n't . i 'm a very good singer in china . but i 'm sure i can pass the book from my university .
the fans are great in the world too . they 're all <unk> for power than the most of the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ?
yes .
oh i see .
yes . chinese tea is one of the most famous tea .
yes . it 's a secret to watch the game i guess .
i do n't really like it at all .
that 's right . it 's a pity that we should not get a product that can allow us to advance the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the year .
i 'm not really scared about the olympic games .
the summer is very exciting . it has been 200 years of history .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
i like baseball the best .
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't know that . but i did n't like them .
i think you 're right . he 's very funny .
it 's a little doll . it 's a bit expensive but it 's a little expensive .
that 's a good idea .
it 's a tv station .
is there anything interesting ?
yes . there are many famous paintings in the exhibition . i like to have a look at their interesting places .
i think that 's true . i think it 's much better than tv .
yes . the tv station is about to start with .
i know . i know i know . but i do n't know what 's on tv .
yes . it 's much better than tv in my country .
i got it . i do n't know how to pay for it .
yes . there are about 50 cents in advance .
a lucky dog !
so is it ?
i do n't know .
how about a year ?
well you can have a rest .
ok . . . .
i 'll be happy to help you .
my birthday is in a formal table so i 'd like to go to a chinese restaurant .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
i see . he s a good team player and he can be very popular .
no i don t think so .
it s just a minute to play the ball . it makes me nervous .
there are many people there .
that 's not the end of the world . they also reduced to a billion .
no there are plenty of rugby fans in your country too .
he did a perfect match . he looks so perfect .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
i can t played the game without coffee in the water .
i guess you 're right . but i still think that 's more important than her .
what s that ?
why ?
it seems you two are getting used to it . just kidding me . how did it go ?
i think it 's time for the kids to get outdoors . .
i guess you can t do that .
oh i remember . i 'm a sweet snack . i 'm so hungry .
well i am glad you could finally make sure you keep track of everything .
no . the pain is killing me .
i will get them ready this afternoon .
no but they did n't .
it is said that the government could provide some money for the homeless .
well i think the route is quite a lot of money for the workers to take part in the euro .
that 's true . we should do more exercise as much as possible .
maybe so but a law banning cigarettes would do no good .
i would like to take it .
i agree . we do n't think that the government should do more to discourage people .
well you can just pay them back . if you lose your job you can just move in with them .
right . the garbage in the park is a very powerful vehicle . it has a lot of <unk> windows .
that s right . i think it s a good idea to see some coworkers that are harder to quit smoking in an office .
no i did n't .
i guess that 's true . what do you think about food ?
no problem . i will deal with that .
can you tell us why he began to leave the company ?
he must be happy .
what is your problem ?
no it 's an emergency you have to wear to wear the best schools .
he ll be doing that .
no it 's the best part .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
it was about 75 years old . there were a few repairs that needed doing but some things were found in order to put in an overall perspective instead of my own perspective . in the village there have some emory have some <unk> in there .
that s why i traveled to the west . the coast of the city is quite small . the village is quite large .
yes it 's so small that we have some of the technical jargon they got in the kitchen .
what about the car pollution ?
yes . i m a junior now .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
i like baseball the best .
what do you think of the football players ?
it s a piece of cake .
oh yeah that s what my husband says .
yes they do .
that 's true . what does your say about that ?
i like playing basketball . it makes a lot of fun .
i can play quite well .
you re kidding . it s the same thing with your hands .
what ? you mean when ? when ?
just two .
i 'm fine thanks . i 'm just glad you called .
i m sorry to hear that . why don t you ask for some time off ? you could take some advice .
i don t know . i ve had a bad cold and i just can t fall asleep .
that s no problem . let me get you a new one .
i work for the bank of china at the beginning of my life . i m really under stress . i m really under the pressure .
i know . i m going to get it repaired right now .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock .
would you like to leave a message ?
yes . i like to read the ancient history channel and the ancient olympics .
i like watching it for a while . it 's a traditional art .
i think you should wear a tie today . you can wear them with your suit and tie .
i m not sure . they are very fashionable and very smart .
you are really lucky . it 's a pity that i have been in the past two months .
i like the title of the book but i m not sure whether it s appropriate or the year .
i like the book that it 's a little confusing for me .
yes . i ve read them .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
he s a very good player . he s a very good player .
i agree with you . you know he should have bought several new films .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week .
are you sure you can do well in the box ?
yes i have . i played the piano when i was at home .
what s the website for ?
no i bought two copies .
you should try to pull out the black pieces .
i think that they must have horrible lives .
i think that they must have been publicity for their movies and themselves . they also do it for their films .
i think that most of the people do that for their good things . they want you to buy anything you want .
i think that maybe they should show people to their demands so they should have a good rest .
i think that many people in america only eat it but kids are just used to . it s not easy to pick up an easy way .
i don t understand how you can have a good review of an exhibition by that critic . he s not good at anything .
i think you should save more of the money . you know the real thing i m sure you have the money for me . i m sure you ll get it for me .
that 's why they only did that !
thanks .
you 're welcome .
i got it from the doctor s .
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
i 'm going to give you a ride .
thank you .
i think we would be able to make it this time .
how about at 10 o 'clock ?
thank you .
yes . i 'll have the red wine please .
i 'm sorry . there 's no point in making a large reduction in this city .
i think so .
were there any animals in such a large place ?
yes . there are many famous historical park in the southern section of the country . people can enjoy it .
i 'm not sure yet .
just call her lisa mary . she 's a nice guy .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
i think that it was n't my fault .
thanks .
well . . . . and you can see that on the point .
you got it .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well we 're going to have to discuss the problem .
yes . we still remember that we had to get married on the plane .
i mean you could never give it up .
i 'm glad you like it .
i m going to the airport to pick up some curtains .
oh that 's too bad .
i said i have to be in the middle of a day .
how long have you been feeling this way ?
he said that i 'm very pleased with your work .
how long would you stay ?
he said he 'd be glad to tell you that i 'm his wife .
he 'll be late for school .
yes . it will be sent to the next few days .
yes it is . but it 's also very hot .
i 'm going to the gym for a workout .
no . don t worry . it s just a piece of cake .
thank you .

i am studying languages .
i see . thank you very much .
yes . and not expensive either .
yes . do you want to have a pair of white wine or a white one ?
that 's a good idea . but i 'm not so sure about it .
pardon ?
i mean most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria they are likely to cause immune system problems .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
i 'm going to get a position to study .
i really don t want to be late .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
i took a long time .
i 'm afraid not . i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?

i said i have to be in the middle of a day .
sorry it 's not available now .
no thank you .
how about your hair ?
i will .
i 'd like to .
i 'm sure you 're right . but i think it 's worthwhile .
no but i think it 's too plain on its own .
i 'm going to give you a ticket .
i have to work .
oh i see .
ok .
i wo n't be late .
oh sorry sir . we will check your table .
i took a break from work and i m taking a long weekend .
ok . i will wait for you .
yeah i 'm the same . i just got into line with you .
i know . it 's a piece of cake . it was the best seller to make . but if you really like it you 've done so just a lot of money .
yeah i 'm pretty sure .
what 's the matter ?
we 're looking forward to the environment cut and the skies is falling out .

you 're welcome .
i 'm glad you like it . i 'd like to have typical chinese food .
i 'm sure you 'll enjoy yourselves .
you 're welcome .
what are you talking about ? it 's not a very good job to write a suitable job and you can speak for a company that needs to be in a job you may be more relaxed and <unk> . . .
no why ?
what school did you take ?
yes they are .
they do n't have to cut into the amount of beans or the ones .
what was the annual salary ?
you should take it easy . it 's important to get to the job done .
sounds not bad !
i do n't know . maybe we can find a common job on the internet .
yes .
fine well thanks for your advice ! i suppose you ve been working very hard . how do you do you do ?
yes i 've been through this for a long time . thanks for calling . goodbye .
well i 've never used one before .
that 's great . i have to think about it .
i 'm afraid i have to go now .
it always hurts .
fine . thanks for your help . i hope you feel better soon .
no thank you . i m sorry .
we will have a beautiful journey .
i 'll take that .
no way !
yeah ? why is that ?
well you know what ? he just broke up with his girlfriend .
so what are you saying ?
what are you talking about ?
you mean you like to give her some tips .
i am going to put my card into my computer .
i do n't know yet .
it s about 100 metres per person .
that 's a good idea . let 's go !
have you thought of a success ?
can i watch the tv now ?
are you sure that 's a tough job ?
yes . i bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted .
yeah but it 's not the same with <unk> . it 's just that it 's not the same .
really ?
yes . and not expensive either .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it off .
i know what you mean . i m going to put a cuff on you .
maybe i should just get a tongue !
yes . i 'm going to take a holiday tomorrow .
don t worry . he ll cross the road . he ll turn to the right when you are hear the noise .
i have to work .
you mean you will have a return flight on july 21st .
it s not just that . it s only a couple of minutes . it s definitely the same name of the mobile phone .
i m not sure . there s a lot of historical figures in recent years . i think that s because they have horrible lives .
i 'm going to miss you .
no . you 're just a little crazy .
fine . thanks a lot .
dan is on top of that . i think they should get the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
hey i 'm just trying to get the new <unk> .
no i 'm not really in the mood .
don t be so shy ! i m going to be late for my birthday !
yeah i can also have a try at least ! maybe i can also have a try at least !
whoa take it easy there . everyone knows you are not very many things to do . one thing smile at you . just keep your hands and show them the way .
yeah i know ! it s always good to hear the advantages of how to use the machine .
yeah . it s a good idea to have a good time in my country .
let s do it !
they are both very well but they are very energetic and very staff .
he s not very good at the long jump but he s not as good as the blue is he ?
he s not bad at the long jump . he s a distance of over four meters . i think he s fine .
that s terrible . so what a great deal of safety ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
oh they are ok . i m fond of the swimming pool . i m not sure about the tea .
you are right . he is not a hard worker but he is very good at longdistance running .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
that s a good idea . she s a very good shot . her e s a pretty picture of a height !
it s a great idea to get a lot of money . it s always a mystery to me .
oh that 's the one .
yes . he 's almost sixty .
he is a very nice guy .
what about your friend ?
of course i will .
i d like to but i m afraid i can t .
you 're welcome .
thank you .
no that 's all i need . thanks .
sure when is good time for you ?
i 'm free tomorrow afternoon .
yes i can .
i 'm not sure .
ok .
no not at all . go ahead .
ok . i 'll pick you up at about nine o 'clock .
yeah but if you want to change your mind then you should have a good rest .
no i was out .
i think it was a great game .
oh really ? when is it ?
yes . do you want to go ?
i 'll see what i can do .
yes i have . what 's up ?
i see .
um . . . i like chocolate and potatoes .
i 'll take them .
it 's business .
that 's great ! i want to hear the <unk> 's concert this evening .
yes . and not expensive either .
what about this one ? it 's a lovely dress .
you have to get up at the next stop and catch the bus .
yes i 've been working overtime recently .
i am sure you will .
i m sorry to hear that .
what are you talking about ?
i think i can find something that is valuable to my desk . i think i can go to the swimming pool first . i have to go to the airport in the morning and can i have a cup of coffee in the afternoon .
yeah . that s a good idea . let s go to a jazz concert .
i know but i m not sleepy . i eat and i eat a lot of fat .
yes i went to the new concert in 2010 .
yeah you re right . i wasn t really in that movie . i have to go to the movies and play basketball with friends .
what kind of things do you find ?
it 's a typical example of ancient chinese zodiac sign .
how can he be so sure ?
i don t think you re right . he s a tried to buy a new camera and teach him how to pay for it .
i agree . it 's probably a lot of fun .
no not really . i m not an excellent team player . i have a very good personality . they are much more professional than <unk> .
well in that case you should keep an eye on your nerves . first of all you cannot go to the top of the exercise . there s no reason for you to keep your knees .
i will think about it .
i think you should do something soon .
that 's right . you can go to the american universities instead .
ok . i 'll never go .
i agree . you can read the characters on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
well we could go to the great wall . it would be great to do some traveling and help us with the <unk> .
i hate to hear of people who are interested in driving driving driving around to the city or go to the private estate agent .
i know . but you should make sure you keep track of yourself .
well i ve always wanted to have a good time .
i see . well can you tell me how to get to the university ?
what 's the problem ?
yes . i have been in the u . s . s . visa .
i 'm going to visit an international travel agency .
that 's good .
okay okay . it sounds like you 're an excellent one .
no i have n't been to the movies .
i hope you can make a decision .
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up .
you have a good point . it s always better to have a lot of people .
i see . it s very nice of you to invite me to an exhibition of my favorite local restaurant . i am sure you will have a good time .
what 's the matter ?
yeah i was . . . . i didn t know . .
i 'm glad you came .
i m not sure yet .
so it was really nice of you to say so .
i can t afford to work out well without a human life that is not easy to do .
i m not sure .
are you sure ? what is he ?
he is really nice and challenging .
oh i m so sorry .
what is that ?
i know . i have to go to a us to visit my parents .
well this is my new baby . he s a lot of fun . he s a lot of fun .
it s quite a lot of work to do .
i 'm not sure . do you know anyone has his wife ?
do you have a dog ?
my mom said i should have a baby so i have to wait for a while .
that 's great . it seems that you really need to learn how to speak your son .
it 's true . it 's highly esteemed among you .
sounds interesting !
i have n't heard anything about the olympic games and the organizational structure is the most intelligent .
i know that . i think that 's a good idea . i think i should get rid of some new clothes in taiwan .
it 's true . it 's a traditional family . i can also recall the young people 's world .
that s a great idea . i ll see you there at around eight .
no i have n't . i had a bad time . i was in the mood for some medicine and my doctor told her that i was there and i was there .
i didn t know you were late .
thanks for telling me this .
no problem .
what s the time ?

so do i . you re going to have to come and visit other people .
i 'm free tomorrow .
well i can t wait to see your christmas tree . we can keep you in mind when you come in . it will be ok to pick up a lot of upstairs .
not a problem . i 'll be happy to .
why do you say that ?
i have to work .
yes . it is . one of my sisters is a doctor and i have a dog and he lives in the neighborhood .
i see . if i can find this kind of deal i would prefer to work in a small department or two to pay each year .
well for many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
that 's true . but i 'm not a big problem .
sometimes it s just that it s just a common sense of people . but in different countries it is fun to keep highly trained people .
what kind of people do you think you re the most interesting ?
i can only afford about 1000 yuan a month .
i ve been out of town . i ve been out of town .
that s good . you can go to the movies during the week .
i went to the coast . i love being with a lot of friends .

i 'm going to the hospital to pick up my keys .
yeah you re right . i m often talk to people and that s it .
no but i do n't really have any .
you 're right .
wow ! good for you !
well i guess you re right . if you re so competent you will have to work on a heavy industry trip .
she asked me to stay in a different dress .
i 'd be glad to . i could get away from you .
what s the problem ?
do they have to work overtime ?
i think you should make some preparations .
how much is it ?
it 's only thirty dollars a month for a month .
why ? what kind of teaching certificate do you want to quit ?
we could take a cut on the bill . the government could provide some money for them but we must add the heart to the as we were talking about it .
we could eat a lot of energy .
i do n't have any plans for the next one .
well let 's do it .

she is going to be so helpful .
i know . she s a teacher and a teamplayer but i have utmost confidence in her abilities . you ve got to deal with her .
yes i once booked a ticket .
oh i see . so you took the wrong bus ?

i 'll go there then . i 'll see you in about 20 minutes .
no . it 's already 5 minutes walk .

it 's a great idea . it 's really a lot of fun .
ok . i will come in and we can talk about it later .
i hope so too . i m really glad you came .

it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go take a look . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i think we should try to get more sleep .
no thank you . that 's all .
i hope so .
i 'll wait for you .
i m not sure . i guess i should call the police immediately .
really ? that s unbelievable . i m sure he ll be dating .
i hope he ll recover soon .
come on ! what are you doing ? i m proud of you !
what s that ? i m not in a bad mood .
it was a hard experience to be a team but i really want to have a good time here .
it 's a love story .
dad ! i m gonna catch the ninethirty train !
yes .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick some grand efforts .
yes .
where do you grow up ?
wow ! it 's almost the same .

that is what i need to provide you with my future business !
i know it 's a new contract for the shipping time . it 's about to make sure that the goods are in good condition .
i m not laughing at it . i m not sure .
i think you should try being a little more careful .
it s a beautiful day to see two world face in the world ! it s a very exciting day to be here in the long run !
i m not sure . it s a very good shot ! the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . . here we are ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked and immediately set up the boards !
cool ! how many miles to the stamp machine can tell you which is coming to the play ?
alright . now he s a bit nervous . what a minute ? are you sure he used to play against him ?
what an amazing goal !
what is it ?
no i 'm afraid not . i 've had some parttime jobs .
you know i 've been working up for a week and i 'm in a hurry .
no i don t . i m a very good manager .
i think it 's much better than to tell people .
i 'm going to a dinner party .
i 'm here on business .
what happened ?
yes here you are .
do n't worry . i 'll get you there .
that 's good advice .
what kind of job do you want to get ?
i want to sit next to the back of my friends .
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take it .
thank you sir .
oh just one .
do you have any plans ?
no problem .
you 're right here . go to gate four .
oh that 's fine .
i 'm sorry sir . i 'll bring you a cloth immediately .
i 'm afraid not . i 've got a meeting in four days .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon . would you mind giving me a receipt ?
oh . . . i guess i 'll have to go to the transport store and look at the bus .
no . it will be necessary for you to get your passport or visa .
thank you .
yes . if you do n't want to miss them you 'll have to use it .
well i see . thank you very much .
it 's hard to say . it 's been a long time since we have to work on this .
i see . thank you .
we are planning to pick you up at the airport .
thank you .
yes that 's right . do you have a flashlight ?
yes i am . i am going to travel by bus so i have a lot of fun this time .
where are you planning on going ?
i 'm going to the hospital to see some embroidery .
no why ?
i see . well then how long does it take to get to 82nd street ?
i think it would be better if you could pick up my prescription for me .
do you think you re overreacting a ? you could do that . you know what you like to do .
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become a <unk> ! how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i m not sure yet .
i m sure you ll find a place to live . there s a possibility of going on in the perfect world .
i guess you 're right . i guess i just have to go to the university that i 'll have to go to my class every day .
i m sorry sir . we will be making a new one next week .
thank you very much .
i am sorry i did n't hear you .
i love you so much .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
look at the men !
i 'm sure she 's very happy .
no she s not as strict as me .
maybe they were just attracted to each other .
i 'm not sure but she 's a heart of heart .
i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to .
why do you say that ?
oh there are no comparison . now we are talking about the ugly .
let 's go and see what we can do .
i traveled around the three gorges .
i 'm sure you 'll love it . i can help you find a good job .
we decided to go to a forest in the suburb . there is a beautiful river there . we can go there .
i did n't know you did that .
oh dear ! did you forget the address ?
yes . i have a picture of her on her right .
i 'm not sure . let me see . . . . it 's a long time to wear .
do you have any idea of the size of your style ?
i 'm not . i 'm sure i 'll be back as soon as i can .
so what did you do ?
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
great . i 'll start my car in the parking lot .
yeah i went to the coast . it was really a nice evening .
that 's just what i was thinking .
i m fine thanks .
i 'm just going to get it .
yes i have . i had them when i was in university .
oh my god . chinese valentine 's day . so what 's american ? are you sure ?
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
i 'm sure you will like it .
no problem .
i know . i 'm really surprised .
you mean that we like to make a big wedding in this country ?
who was your idea ?
i 'm afraid we have to reschedule it .
it takes two to make a few months to make a decision .
it 's unbelievable . he likes to do things on us .
do people get along well with each other ?
how did you do that ?
yes i 'm not really sure . what 's on ?
then let 's go in .
ok .
i 'm sorry . i 've got an important meeting .
what 's your idea ?
he 's really good looking .
he 's not young as he looks . he loves the girl very much .
thank you .
he 's a very serious person .
i do n't think so . this is going to be tough but i think it 's worth it .
i hope that i get to know someone else .
you are very lucky .
you mean you are in love with your friends ?
i have to work .
but if you think about it it a good idea for a young man you should try to find a job that is <unk> .
that 's a good idea . you should tell your general public her in english .
i do n't know . i know that i know that . i know you are a good friend . but i know i have to work in the american cooking more . i do n't know what to do .
i think you 're right . but i think chinese is more difficult to learn .
i think you are right .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
well . . i used to be a vet . it 's not a bad idea to be a child .
she 's got a promotion .
that 's right . i see . and the management in your company ?
do people get married ?
well in a way i think we should be more careful . some words are very different from the world .
he said he had to get rid of it .
oh dear . i guess we can t do this .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i have to go to the ladies to write a letter of credit .
don t worry about that . it s probably of the stress you ve been under . just take these days .
here is your bill . do you need anything else ?
i 'm on a diet .
oh really ? then what about your mother ?
i feel terrible .
maybe . but they are just different .
well i ve always been good for a long time . if i had n't studied you probably would have time to make some chinese food .
she 's terribly sorry about that . she 's going to have to leave the office suddenly and wo n't be able to come back to office by then . she hopes you again .
yeah . they can make it .
do you want to know something ?
well we have a good variety of chinese antiques and porcelain . do you like it ?
yes i 'm sure you 'll need to . i 'm sure you 'll find a credit card with us .
if you want to have a guest ticket you will have to use chopsticks .
i know . i 'm really hungry .
ok . i will bring a free next week .
it 's a great idea . it 's a great idea to see an old band .
are the prices stated in the interview ?
i know . i am really in a mood for some kind of book .
well i 've never used to be in a church before . if you want i can just imagine how beautiful it is !
well i have n't eaten there before .
you can put many things on the list there .
yeah that sounds great .
it 's quite hot . i do n't like it very much .
we usually get a few rain in the mornings . the rain falls only about 20 degrees in the summer . the rain falls mostly in winter .
i think the winter is warm .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . in the winter it is hot .
yes . i think the days of summer will be too cold for some days . do you think we should go hiking before noon ?
not really . we do n't have a lot of fog days . would you like to go to the summer palace ?
yes . i have two tickets . i will take it .
do you have a lot of winter in your city ?
yes but i do n't really like it very much .
i know . it 's a pity that we have been there only once or twice as a year .
i know that swimming is great for me . i also enjoy sand and trees . it is great for us to sand in the summer .
i think we would like to have a beautiful view of the lake .
is it really completely flat ?
no it 's not as good as in taiwan .
they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
i m not sure about that . they re not used to have many gold but great nightlife .
that s great . i think most people do . there are a lot of historical exhibits there . there are cliffs on many small shops that take place place but they do n't want to see it . there are many small islands off the coast so many people go wild of the coast .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
we don t really know about it . there s a lot of traffic but i don t think it s a big problem .
i don t know . the government is also keen on making money .
that s great . i think we should do something we should do . that s when we go to the country .
i think that most people do . a sense of mixed drinks are a good idea . one of the other always appear at a leisured pace we can do a good impression to make your own wine
i think that 's a good idea . i think that we should try to reduce our quantity .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i have been to the states in china but i haven t been to the states .
i m from chicago . are you a lot of business ?
i 'm from australia . i came to see . but i 've been to spain .
i 'm from canada .
isn t it really cold there ?
yes . it s a pleasant trip .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
certainly .
if it s not a bad idea then it s quite a lot of fun .
certainly .
what 's more some traditional chinese medicine ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
i wonder how long this weather can last .
you really are really lucky .
i do n't think so .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon . would you mind giving me a receipt ?
i agree with you .
no . they 're really delicious .
yes i like it very much . i hope i can get some butter and sugar first .
it s a supposed to be about an hour or so . do you want to go to a concert ?
i 'm going to the store .
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
i 'm so glad you called .
i feel the same way .
yes i do .
that 's a long time .
i 'm not sure . i know that i 'm a lousy person here . but i have to go to her office and i want to do some good chemistry together .
well i guess you 're right . but i think it 's time for you to get things done .
i 'm going to the travel agency .
i 'm sure she 'll be all right .
yes . she is . she is very good and her hair is also very short .
i think you 'll like it .
yes but i 'm afraid it 's too cold for me .
do you have a storage fever ?
what are you going to do ?
yes i 'm going to take a holiday tomorrow .
no i do n't like playing chess .
i know . i never played basketball very well .
do n't worry about it . most of the customers choose to save energy while you 're a good exercise for a kid . it 's a good way to save some kind of personality .
now that i have to watch my weight .
yes .
i wish i could stay for more than 3 months .
really ? congratulations !
it 's a romantic called soul food .
i 'm afraid i have n't had time since i got married .
do n't worry about your family .
i missed it .
that 's true . but i do n't know why you 're always willing to work overtime and it 's important to take care of your employees .
i bought it here a few months ago .
what time does the party start ?
i 'm sorry sir . i 'll give you a ticket .
it sounds a bit tight .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
did he give you a nose ?
just let me sleep 5 more minutes .
i do n't like winter . i 'm not too cold .
i think the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to play .
i know . i 'm really in a hurry . i 'll be waiting for you .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank you . . .
i 'm just trying to find a nice place to live with you .
what ?
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . .
sure . how much do you need ?
it 's a bit tight but it 's too heavy .
last week .
no i have n't .
that 's a good idea . if you want to find a job that is then it 's more convenient for you to join the job if you want to join me .
ok . i will go home and get sara 's information before the exam .
what 's that ?
i 'll tell you .
oh excellent . do you have a minute ?
we can go on a picnic .
that 's great .
what 's that ?
it sounds <unk> . but i do n't know .
sure . why do you want me to keep them ?
thanks .
i 'm doing great .
i heard it 's supposed to be the same as today .
i have to work .
oh that s really convenient .
i know . but it 's dangerous .
i know . he never did that .
i got jacob . any ideas what should i do ?
that s the sort of thing you ve had .
yeah you re right .
how long will it take to get to shanghai on ?
it 's so old . it looks like it 's broken .
well i ve been playing football since i was a child .
impossible . my pager is really old .
yeah . they re really running you .
i am so sorry sir . your plane will take off soon .
great ! i ll go .
that s pretty good . it s really cheap for one .
yeah ! i m not really interested in it .
really ? then tell me about it .
i think so .
thank you . i was really surprised .
yes but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too .
look next time i have fallen for her .
oh good news . you 've been completely out of the office .
ok mr . wang can i speak to mr . wang please ?
i am so sorry to hear that . we are always willing to do this for you .
i was just there a couple of days ago . you know you should go down there too .
have you had any unusually stressful situations in your life lately ?
yes i am . i went out with her last week .
oh really ? so you just took it a long time .
i did n't know that .
thank you steven . i still think i 'm going to get married .
really ? how long have you been with her ?
yes . i 'm from texas .
you mean he had a crush on you ?
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can you tell her something about her ?
about seven years ago . we were married for four years . we married on the 12th of the fifth of the month . they ve been married a month and we both have a lot of different people .
come on you re right . i m gonna let you off my new car . i m gonna have to run up a lot of work .

i d love to but i m afraid i can t . i ve already got a lunch engagement .

i am going to be thirsty and i hope i can get a drink .
congratulations !
the palace hotel .
you should also ask her out for a party and get the food .
it s nice that we have to go to the park .
i think it s a pity that we should go to a solution to find a solution to the people .
there are my parents my sister and me .
i have one daughter and one son . how do you want to your parents ?
my father died in a family when i was a child .
my father lives in seattle .
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister .
i have one brother and my sisters .
how long have you been married ?
about seven years .
no . i 'm still working on my own .
i maintain that the most important thing is that the people s mother s mother is a person s mother s mother s mother is the boss who teaches the company .
i know . it s hard to find a place to live in .
if you lose your job you could marry by your brother and your wife .
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
