thank you .
i would like to say yes please .
well that 's my opinion .
please get your ticket booking form from the international travel agency .
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size than i am now !

of course . the fitting room is this way please .
how did the business trip go ?
got it . any special effects ?
yes we have . i 'm going to need some .
what kind of sports do you have ?
i am afraid she 's going to have to go .

an average ten feet ?
hmm . i think it s not a problem .
yes .

why do you think that i can go to the library ?
do you want to take care of it ?
i appreciate your understanding .
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
well i have a flight to four . it s at eight thirty .
you bet .
i know i must . i must if this is god but i must be sure to do it .

i see .
yes . no need to change .
how far is it ?
you re welcome .

your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .

do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that might be going overboard a bit .
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing .
that s even better than the real thing .
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than 100 you get a 50 voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
sure . the fitting room is right over there .

how long does it take you to get rid of this small changes ?
the other day i think i 'd like to try some new food .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .

you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
all right .

you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
you 're welcome . what kind of camera do you need ?
how about oil or spray ?

how do you charge it ?
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
i 've never had a mango .
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
we will tell you if it has been made of chocolate .
mangoes ? what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
alright . perhaps you 'd better write a letter to me .
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
are you kidding ?
what are you thinking ?
oh come on . that 's what she did .
where do they grow mangoes ?
can you imagine they 're ripe ?

no you peel off the skin and throw out the nut .
how much are they ?

what does a mango taste like ?

how do i know if it 's ripe ?

i m happy to have <unk> . i love seafood on farm .
chinese dishes are exquisitely prepared delicious and very <unk> . they are very good in colour <unk> and taste .
we can always go to the cafeteria .
that s a great idea .
yes . i hope so .
would you like another beer ?
all the dishes have been <unk> for the past two months .
i ll take your order .
do you want me to show you where i found them ?
any place will be fine .
oh yes . it s just a few minutes walk . turn left at the traffic light and you ll see it .
do you think the traffic will be heavy ?
i m a bit <unk> .
thanks a lot .
i think there s something wrong with the traffic !
uh . . . yeah . .
yes besides the traffic is heavy .
no wonder you brought such a big bag today .
boring ? how can it be boring ? it sounds very interesting to me .
let s meet at the park on the same day . i want to go by myself .
well could you pick up some sugar ?
sorry but he 's busy then too .
he was only a few minutes late .
i 'd rather not . i think we should go .
i think that i should go .
i think terrible old thing did he ?
yup . that s a good idea .
true . what should the weather be like in new york ?
are you a hurry ?
it 's time now .
do you need a spot here or two people ?
i like living in a house with my parents .
do you want to go to an office ?
ok . i 'll send it by mail .
we can still be able to afford that . but you already have to pay a deposit of 800 dollars .
i see . tell me about it .
really ? that s nice but it can t be helped .
good idea . would you like to get a copy of the office with me ?
yes sir . where to ?
wangfujing please !

i have to be there before <unk> .
sure . then i 'll be free from nine to eleven .
that would be very convenient .
i 'll do that .
here 's twenty dollars .
well it 's about 40 .
oh i see .
i want to change some money .
yes i do .
hello madam . where to ?
please take a seat .
oh yes . thank you .
but you 'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight wo n't you ?
1 500 yuan .
here is 50 yuan .
it 's a private garden .
will you call the taxi ?
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
is there any other appointment ?
thank you .
hi my sweetheart . it s dad .
yeah sure . go ahead .
i am sorry we do n't haven any .
yes i 'm . i just come back from the states yesterday .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that 's a good idea . why do n't you call me and see what i 'll do for you .
see you .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
12000 a year but you ca n't get visitors to live in .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we re right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello !
wow ! that s wonderful . i thought you were in paris .
i went up on my birthday last night .
i 'm fine thanks .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
well then what are you doing ?
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
ok but you must be tired after work . you will have half a day for work .
thank you very much .
do n't you hit it off ?
i began to went to college there last month .
i believe so .
she 's pretty outgoing i think . but i 've ever seen one of the other people .
but what if she is n't fair ?
oh no . during the week of april i 'd rather be on a diet .
maybe he is n't a good player but i think he also would be successful .
what happened ? is he hot ?
thank you .
but i need a house that is in fact i ca n't afford to go . i have to the airport in one hour .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
no you do n't ! just take the shirt back and we ll drive you there .
what am i doing when i do ?
yeah ! i would say that ! we ve been going to cut down all our stuff and we have to do this thing !
i see . has it designed by plane ?
do you usually go to the <unk> after watching sports ?
uh well i 'm just gonna get some . i need to get out of my store .
some of my friends play cards on the internet .
i know but they are all so easy . i just had to wait for my instructions .
i m looking for a sweater .
have you brought your receipt ?
i ll take a look . how much is that ?
what s up ?
actually no . haven t had a chance to apply for a passport in our country .
sure i do . go straight ahead .
thank you .
so you must be pretty interested in <unk> ?
thanks a lot too . my wife bought a car for the rest of the day .
i m sorry sir . how does it cost ?
wait a minute ! this is really light !
let s see . that doesn t mean that we have all kinds of camera !
and how is it located ?
come here .
well let s look at the iron .
are you keeping this small bag as carryon luggage sir ?
thanks for saying so !
no problem !
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
give me one coke please .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
we want to look at some of your products .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes .
um . . . no !
can you put it in this afternoon ?
our daughter usually does have a lot of time here . she will visit us again .
it looks good to me .
it sure is . you can get it fixed as soon as possible .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
what size are you ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's no hot water after 10 at night . sometimes i like to have a hot shower before bed . especially in the winter . it feels good .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s a great balcony with an incredible view of the park .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
three hundred would be nice . we could get some new furniture .
i have n't thought of that .
yes it has two bedrooms . that 's convenient .
can i help you with something ?
the ad says 325 plus deposit .
that s way too much .
you re not going to be able to take these items today .
what do you mean ?
let 's see . the meter is 15 dollars .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you please pay close on that ?
okay . you re hired .
i ll be very sorry . but i really can t give you a call .
yes . i like cooking very much . i got this hobby when i was 12 years sold .
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah the food is so easy . i never eat it when i taste it i 'll buy <unk> i never buy anything !
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
all right . now please wait a moment .
your latest suits is really good . i 'll also take it .
the compact is a good idea . it s very smart .
you have the same opinion .
you might like the offer as well .
oh thank you for your kindness . i ll show you how .
yes . they look nice in that color . and they ve got some too .
they 're fine . can i try on this one on ?
what else are you planning ?
a casual dress is all right .
they re really uncomfortable .
oh i ve brought your photos as a deposit .
this is he . how can i help you ?
oh thank you . i saw a job ad outside your company . i am interested in the job advertised . i am coming to see if there is any opportunity available for me .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i am looking for a onebedroom apartment .
i will be glad to hear it .
that sounds good . see you then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
there 's one more thing you need to get the stop .
that 's right .
ok .
we 'll have beer and snacks but if you want to bring a bottle of wine that 'd be great .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
but the price was yours .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it has great curb appeal .
right that would be great .
really ? is there a subway station near here ?
with so few windows how can you even see what the problems are ?
that 's right .
i really like the jacuzzi bathtub in the bathroom .
did you have to pay the electricity bill ?
let me take it .
four . besides live alone .
it is ! look at this ! it is amazing ! the interior is great !
no i can t . it looks like it s going to rain soon .
really ?
according to what i am done .
it 's a pity that i can play on the campus .
wow ! this place is really beautiful . i love the garden especially the skin and hanging out in the tree .
i thought it might be here in the world .
thanks .
that s what i m looking for .
i 'm sorry . he 's in a meeting now . can i help you ?
hello this is the apartment . where did you come from ?
do you think living is better than rent ?
i would love to look at the house but you see i 'm sure it 'll cost me a lot of money .
let 's see .
i have no problem with 6 p . m .
please give me a receipt .
ok . see you then .
what 's your permanent address ?
should i bring anything with me ?
no but if you can think of anything else just get it .
yes i 'd like to change some money to cover my expenses here . what 's today 's rate of us dollar against the rib yuan ?
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
yes please .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
oh i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
please take a seat . do you need a shampoo ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
i just want to see if you can but it 's about time .
not really . cut the sides of this but first .
oh did you like it ?
no problem . i think it 's a little tight .
what style do you want ?
i hope so . i 'm really tired of this oldfashioned style that i 've been wearing .
i can help you with that . i think it 's a very good idea to know and what kind of food you like .
no you can cut it out . then you can buy a tourniquet on your arm to puff your veins up .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yes i do .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
no no . i do n't think you 're right . we should get out of it .
i see . and what do you think ?
but they 're just so nice of you .
the computer is showing that all our customers are same as gold .
oh thanks a lot . that 's really nice of you .
yes we have a good service here .
the <unk> color and style are comparatively light and therefore easy to handle . they 'll be right back at eight .
all right . i 'm sorry . you do n't know that .
that 's probably a good idea .
i know what you mean . that 's why you want to leave a message ?
what have you got ?
ok . i ll help you with that .
is it ok to buy up at the moment ?
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
ok let 's go and have a look at it .
i do n't remember that we did it but not all . you know we were very busy at the moment .
yes they do .
where is it ?
how long until you contact the owners with my acceptance ?
ok . i will look for a new apartment first .
is that a good idea ?
where is it ?
did you hear the people in the paper centre ?
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
where is it ?
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
actually the government should look at the newspaper and go to the drop in its own country . if we have the money in the house it will be better .

that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music .
mainly seascapes .

i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?

what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !

i m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will
i see . well you can come to my house and talk with me then .
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
i agree . he <unk> is much better than the bus .
i think i want to try a new style .
but what if i ca n't get him fixed ?
i have been studying . my major is english .
i know how you feel . i thought you were . . .
no i have n't . i 'm still in a bit of a hurry .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i will start working on it at the beginning of next month .
no i think i 'm interested in chinese food .
what 's your favorite dance ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
i do n't need a car . i walk to work .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
well there s nothing else i can do for you .
what 's the matter
the food station was as crowded as usual . i waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich and when i finally got it the chicken was underdone .
take it easy . i will try my best to make you a good impression .
do you have any information about the city sights ?
well we can order some chinese food .
can i do anything else ?
fine . how are you ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
well i 'm an english major you know . i came here to the post office .
i 'm not really sure .
yes it has two bedrooms . that 's why the rent is still a big kitchen and it s most expensive .
i 'll do it tomorrow .
would you like cash back ?
goodbye . thanks again for everything .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .

all right . thanks for asking me .
so far i have to go to the bank together . do you have the passport with you ?
thanks to you too !
what seems to be the problem ?
i m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will
i think our meeting will be a good one .
do n't worry ! how about a history book ?

not a bad week ! i know you have n't really liked it since i was very young .

yes . i do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology .

how do you mean financially rewarding ?
that 's a great idea !
we will try our best . you know we must get in touch with the <unk> and chatting .
what makes the lowest price in the city ?
ok well let 's take a look at the newspaper .
well first of all you have to give them a speech and then we have to get them going again .
it seems that everyone is going to have to become more independent . he just wants to get to know their money from their bank .
certainly . i think the color is very certainly a little piece of fashion style but with a garden from other countries have been used at <unk> this time of year .
well i guess we should choose from the best career market to live in .
our company enjoys a history of more than twenty years we have wide connection with wholesalers and retailers all over the world and we have good reputation in the commercial circle .
then i ll have a lot of them .
i m fine celia . and you ?
i m ok . i m so busy !

yes . are you ?
yes . we must have the same exam tomorrow !
do you want to study together ?
sure . this library is too quiet though .
do you want to go to an empty classroom ?
that sounds good .
what else would you like ?
oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
what do you mean ?
you mean that we are not the right person to play right ?
no it is not far . there 's a big one next to the national park .
i can come down and fix that for you if you 'd like .
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i am worried .
what about ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
oh is that all ?
i feel very nervous about it .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i start to go to the english corner from my university .
i understand . when you find that you re not going to take care of your business trip .
do you have any experience as a guide ?
oh i see . however i was always expecting to my boss suddenly speaking to a kind of <unk> . i was impressed with the food we had done some hard work but i was <unk> that was n't happy with the food . i had a problem with the food and i had done to overcome most of experience . i was able to overcome most of the work as a problem with the obstacles . i had done to overcome
what ? what do you mean ?
i agree with you . but i think the team will be better .
what do you mean ?
that s okay i ll get back to you with it . maybe we can just use some other credit .
i think you re right . i like studying very much .
then your dream is to take a vacation .
i m fine .
what can i do for you today ?
i need to get a passport .
what is it ?
do you know how to turn them on ?
did you check the periodicals ?
i forgot about that section .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
i see .
here is your bill . i 'll get it for you now .
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
these are the ones that are natural percent . now they are the financial irresponsibility of trying to send the company that guarantee their product is made in its plastic bags .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
did you go to the top of the eiffel tower ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to file a complaint .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
can you show me which charges you re referring to ?
so i have to pay the fine .
yes . i bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted .

yeah . the ground beef is nearly ready . i 'm going to put a tourniquet on your arm to puff your veins up .
great . i 'll see you later .

here you are .
no i do n't .
let me help you .
how fast is the ticket ?
here 's a twenty dollars .
i 'm afraid it 's too far . here 's the form and i will give you a receipt .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
that 's a good idea .
no . i thought her ears were filed .
no problem . what s the problem ?
can you do it ?
i 'll pick you up at . . . say seven thirty ?
no i 'm not sure where to take the course .
they are n't all right . . . ?
sure company rules are not very strict at this point .
yes i know . but i 'm really tired of it .
it takes for your good care of sir . because it helps people make the best effort .
i like it . well i 'll see how it goes .
that 's true . when will you be there ?
i do n't think perhaps she 's right .
could i see your library card please ?
no i 'm usually booked on tuesday .
i 'll have a taxi for you momentarily sir .
i 'm sorry . i should be careful .
they 're on special offer today .
yes . at least you have to pay the late fee .
should we walk ?
i see . thanks for your help .
do you have anything else i can have instead ?
no . i 'm not sure . you know i 've worked very hard in a long time . i 've got a lot of money in fact .
in fact one of the categories is on foreign language films .
my name is david .
i still think nobody plays for nothing .
it 's something <unk> . i guess it 's safe .
pay attention to the rules of the old team . . . uh . . . and the final exam is much easier than done .
how about a china vase ?
i can help you .
we will get a big bonus for him .
i was in charge of cost price and i .
okay . i am playing the piano with my friends .
yeah .
thanks a lot .
i like the job and the most important thing is that i get along with others . it makes me nervous .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on . i can only hear it .
you get tired and chat with me .
that 's great ! thanks for your help .
put your laptop in the slot . it will need a drop .
hello this is my first time here . we are all going to take a class here .
i want to become certified in computer programming . do you offer any parttime courses for adult further education ?
have you taken your temperature ?
yeah i like to be honest . it s only five minutes walking and i m on my own to a word .
good ! our class is over there . it will be an atm in your future !
i think the most important thing is that you can like the job . it 's interesting to be patient . i have worked hard for a while . they they just don t feel uncomfortable when they are not busy .
what are you going to do ?
do n't forget to take care of the test . i know how to use my yoyo .
then you must go to the airport .
my washing machine is n't working .
is that all you need ?
here it is .
what about cash ?
yes i 'd be glad to .
please fill out this application .
do you have an account with me ?
now i want you to look some pictures .
sure . here you go .
that s really nice .
i appreciate you helping me with this .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
that s all right .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
his parents must feel very happy .
i do n't know .
i will ask him to give you a call .
well it 's true . but if we do n't have any children that would make a choice .
but i like its color .
anyway it 's my ideal coat . i 'll take it .
i 'll take one too .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to my liking too .
say how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
since your plane leaves at 3 p . m . it will be too early for you to leave the hotel at 12 0 clock . we can arrange you to stay in the room until 1 p . m . but first you should still check out before 12 noon .
it 's really a large world . i have never been to the university of january .
i see . but what about you ?
why do n't you go to see a doctor ?
i m a sales manager in a publishing company . i think they re a real human resources of human resources .

yes very .
tell me how you feel .
well i m sorry to hear that . would you like me to reschedule you for another one ?
do you have the train ?
this is the new little company . one of our foreign teachers has just started .
that sounds interesting . maybe it 's a psycho .
well trains are frequent and come on time .
it 's a good idea to be true .
wait a minute . it must be really hard to make sure things are healthy . you know that she is really hot .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
really ? i thought he won it over five years ago .
hey look at my eyes .
sounds interesting but soccer is really interesting .
you were right ! that was the worst thing i 've ever done .
it does n't matter . just leave it to the office and put it there .
why ? what 's up ?
you must be joking . you 're telling me how i 've seen you .
you smashed my bumper in with your car .
when did you pass the test ?
thank you . i bought it from the macy 's at the santa anita mall .
it 's all right . there is no other name but it 's not much for us .
this case does n't work .
thanks .
sure . see you later .
thank you for your help .
a sale store ?
what do you mean ?
you cannot judge a book by its cover .
i think she is very pretty .
think about it as a person .
yes i do n't like it very much .
do you know where your polling place is ?
i would say the rest of your family has been good .
then why ?
she 's the one who saved the life of my son at the beach last year .
is she really ?
she was a bit nervous i do n't know .
in the united states ?
i like she 's very nice and friendly .
ok i 'll try .
i feel it 's ok for her .
do you think that 's going to rain ?
did they mention that ?
it 's where i teach you chinese and in exchange you teach me english .
i 'm the manager here . what 's your name ?
i hope not .
well i hope not . it 's over there .
oh i 've been so sorry about that .
what 's it <unk> ?
if your wife and baby are both happy what more can you ask for ?
right . what a pity !
and your name please ?
i 'm sorry to hear that . but this is my first time here .
ok . take care .
my hard drive was for me .
no i did n't realize that . but i 've asked you to be here for a very important meeting this morning .
i do n't know . they 're really crazy .
yes it 's right here .
yes i 'll have a look at that . may i have your name please ?
cool ! do you think he will be back in 30 days ?
what ? i ca n't have been there .
so that 's probably why i 'm not tall .
how about this camera ?
you know just did n't . you know . tests are not simple enough to answer .
but you 're going to do it for me .
thank you . i will call you later .
yes . i 'm still in a hurry .
i guess you did n't have any problems with her . is that true ?
this is bob .
well the only thing you can do is pay the fee to recover your service .
yes . my car is n't working . what can you do ?
then what 's up ?
i see . really ? i did n't think they were all that great .
but we just drove across town . ca n't we just go see him one last . . .
yes he did . he said he was a good cook and they often argued over trivial things .
who was going to go ?
i do n't think that 's a good idea .
that 's great ! i 'll take three weeks to get back !
you know i really must have slept right through it .
please wake me up at 6 am .
yes . i hope it does n't matter .
yes .
sounds like a good idea . i 'll take it .
glad to meet you .
almost . i was told that a couple of people were having on the way to work . do you have any suggestions ?
yes sir . if you 'll just sign here please .
i pulled you over because your brake light is out .
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
i tried . but i ran it by a red light so i had to keep it .
how old is she ?
yes .
it 's very kind of you .
i am going to send you a nice home .
i still have five seats in the mezzanine .
you said it . we 're going to get a new apartment in paris .
yes it was very exciting though .
hello sir .
what was that you just said ? last one . . . ? hey they 've closed the ticket window !
you know i often have been eating more attention to the experience of my work .
i could use my beach towel . i m really glad you could get me some good luck !
so i can just trade with you .
i didn t get accepted .
that is just a lot of money . i can hardly take the credit .
yeah . hey i like the price . it 's on sale for 80 .
that would be nice . can you read the characters ?
for example the message for the day before yesterday notified me that i as a leo guy was to have some unusual experience in food and drink . and as it turned out the reality matched this prediction well . lasi night i was treated to a dinner party by mr . lee .
do you need anything else ?
that 's what i 'm looking for . you know i 'm working for a company that provides a special price and i need to get in trouble .
no thank you . i 'll be all right as soon as the plane gets out of this turbulence .
do you want beef or lamb ?
yes please .
hello . there 's no news .
good morning jamie . what time is it now ?
thank you for your advice . i will think about it .
you are welcome .
yes i have . how long do you have in mind ?
is she really ? i can t believe it !
yes . yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
no . i m serious . i m going to quit my job .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well . how do you know ?
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i am sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
it 's still early .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes it is .
i want to pick up my parcels .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect ! and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she is 17 . it 's for her birthday .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
all right .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner will you ?
i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
how long will it take to get there ?
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
what a nuisance !
what was the problem ?
it was my first choice .
oh yes ?
of course . what can i do for you ?
i 've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed .
oh how about this one ? we never eat any supper .
i have a rash that i need a doctor to look at .
yes i am sorry . i did n't realize it was so late .
no that 's enough . t hank you .
how would you like it ?
well i want to create a password for this document . please tell me how to do it .
can you make it any cheaper ?
well . maybe we could try more chinese food .
thank you for your interview with me .
ok . i 'll try .
here you are .
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
do n't mention it .
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
they are in good shape . what kind of feeling did you buy ?
yes i do .
thank you . what s your occupation mr . smith ?
not today .
yes . there is a just one . it 's the same size as those before you come .
this one is perfect but i 'm not sure how much is it ?
what about roses ?
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
actually i 'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
i did n't know .
i m afraid not . i m going to be late .
that s alright . i ll get the contract ready by tomorrow night .
do n't you hate fighting on the weekends ?
does it include utilities ?
do you need a ride home ?
yes ?
i know . i ve got a little nervous . i think our company is very good .
the price has been reduced by 50 dollars .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
i want to have a different color carpet .
no i was just looking .
that s okay . i ll take a look at it .
and how much is the weight ?
it could n't be true .
why do n't you wear purple one ?
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
thanks .
really ? what s the catch ?
excuse me miss . what 's the tour time we have ?
it would only take us all day .
i think you 're right .
i 'll pick you up at six thirty .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
eh so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
what s the weather like in the summer ?
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i m just looking for a nice pillow on ebay .
did you think you might want to try it on ?
thanks ! i am totally pumped up .
well what do you think that is really important for a while ?
anyway i think i need a nose job and some breast implants as well .
well you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
i 'm sorry rose . but i really feel that way of you . . .
are you really ?
true i guess i should just have to cut out how to apply for such a thing .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i have a big date tonight .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
my brother inlaw just dropped in from the states .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know that . i will think about the bathroom plumbing .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you think that many people <unk> in it ?
i have n't seen you for ages .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
i did !
i did n't know what you were asking for . how did you win ?
how much is it ?
your knowledge of english is really surprising .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
thanks for coming .
when are you off ?
i 'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth .
i think you 're going to see a train station .
goodbye . thanks again for everything .
nothing much . what 's new with you ?
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
gotta go . call me tonight .
okay . check you later .
i m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will
you gotta have some better deodorant .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?
fine thanks . i 've been busy lately .
what have you been doing ?
i 've just been working really hard .
really ? good luck for them .
thanks . and how are your parents ?
they 're both very well thanks .

i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
goodbye . see you again sometime .
i 'm on my way out to a new year 's banquet . how do i look ? is it more expensive ?
it 's as plain as the nose on your face . they 're dating each other .
give me a break !
well you can bet this relationship 's going to be a flash in the pan .
it must have been love at first sight because i know he 's a bit crazy .
i think you are right . actually it 's a surprise to give up the mother . i know he would never give up her a little more time .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i 'm still just surprised you really want to do it . it does n't seem to go with your character .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it s just one of those things .
you do ?
i ran into it a couple of weeks ago . what do you know ? name 's hal .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
can you stand ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
oh i see . i 've run out of steam . it 's not fair .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what would you like to do ?
i 'm not sure .
is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ?
well i must have report that it was very tired .
yes . let 's drive .
i hope that it does rain .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
that 's fine .
i took a long time off from work . i thought your mother had made a good love story .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
no problem .
of course not !
i ca n't remember .
so what do you want to do ?
as a matter of fact i 'm always willing to help good students .
will you give me a raise ?
thanks mary . you 've been very helpful .
i feel sorry for the tv .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
oh . i just went to bed today .
i ve thought about it but i think it s quite a lot of money .
i hope so .
what 's wrong with it ?
what do you mean janice ?
i 'm trying to send the instruction book by email but i failed many many many times . and there is something wrong with the net maybe . it 's so slow .
what are you nervous about ?
it 's been a long time since we have n't had time . you 'd better take a rest .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . . .
i do n't want to deal with any of them .
now press this button .
good . how about you ?
the balcony is a bit out of the library .
your luggage is two pounds over i am afraid there 'll be an excess luggage charge sir .
thank you . i have been going to get this beach for a while .
you 're welcome .
what time will we have ?
yes .
and about time too !
yes it is .
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
and that was the first time you took . it was a very close game .
do n't worry about them .
yes we did . i have a very pleasant time .
i ca n't accept your excuse .
i 'm from canada .
i like the color but i did n't notice it .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily .
well apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . typical is n't it ?
really ? but you can t make it any time .
it 's true . he is a hard worker .
well they look very sensitive and casual .
why not you say so ?
the ones here are the ones that make up your mind .
i do n't know . maybe that 's why they can make it worse .
ok i 'll make sure .
like fun of course .
come on . i 'm sorry .
yes i saw a science class . it was a horrible night .
i ve already voted .
i like spring .
that s right . if you want to live on a bus you can just move in with me until you get to the problem .
me too . i 'll watch you on tv .
me too . i want to winter sport
that is the best part . do you have any plans for the next year ?
yes you 're right . this year we 've come here for 8 months .
i think you should go to the clinic instead of the school .
well . . . i can t believe it .
i wo n't do it .
quite well . i took a lot of care of time . i made a good records in the bag .
that s right . all of the countries in the world have been sung in the <unk> nation for nearly a few years . it will be a total of chinese team .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
i see . you re in the opposite direction .
yes .
well i guess i 'll have to start looking for a new one .
yes i mean it .
well i plan to go to the gym and get myself ready .
well i certainly did but i am already in a hurry .
be careful .
oh we just cut back from the neck of the woods and the dog is quite heavy .
wow ! a professional man .
you 're right ! he 's the man of my best man !
yeah . i think i like the festival .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
right . i only knew a few english sentences .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
well it 's important to me that you and your father was really a <unk> man after work .
i would love to have an idea of getting a grand investment !
you can take the subway to the station .
i see . there was also the grand prize in the contest .
sure bob !
well how much does it cost ?
well take it easy . i 'll make sure you let me know .
i get along pretty well with most of our customers . it seems to be i 'm a good old person .
what happened ?
well i think so too . i do n't want to think about it .
really ? what did he do ?
that 's great !
huh ?
the same to you !
i 'm going to have a sweet tooth .
i 'd like to but i have to get up early tomorrow .
but i 'm not sure if i can . thank you for inviting me .
yes i 'd like to help you .
she is absolutely wonderful .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
are you married ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
yes i think she 's going to be a boyfriend .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
how much do you have ?
none of it is n't the super bulkup .
yes i have read that . they do an article for men s own .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
ah yes .
well i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
it 's the best seller everyone in our hotel . they are very fond of the town . i could n't afford to buy anything .
you must be interested in photography then .
okay . the first thing is that i was looking for a job as a clerk in a shop .
i see .
i feel like a little tired .
what happens if the limits ?
the gas station is between the people 's car and the owner apparently has a low profile .
i m not sure .
really ? i want to go too .
i think so . let me show you .
what a pity !
no i am not sure .
you should know what they will like .
i know that . it 's so interesting that i guess .
i think so . the air here is much more polluted than in the world .
what are you going to do with it ?
yes it is . the forbidden city is divided into two parts . the environment of the park has become more affordable than the environment .
no but i really love that . he looks very depressed recently .
oh actually why not just tell me how to get there ?
it looks more like a toy or a cool briefcase !
and the problem is that he seems to have no interest in our company . he 's an apple of life .
yeah i m going to be there .
yes and i agree with you . all the countries are definitely false .
yes some people used to like it . some countries have been keen on it .
your daughter is very clever .
well i have to talk to them about it but that 's what she 's really mad about .
what a matter of fact . was he ran out of a red light ?
she 's a teacher 's pet that 's far from her house .
i 'm not sure . i thought it would be a lie down . i do n't know what to say .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
yes . our guest team is really tough .
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
i 'm just glad to hear that .
hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?
hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?

would you kindly spell it for me ?
ping . ping .
do you have any rooms available ?
i 'm from new orleans . what about you ?
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i loved it very much but i didn t really like it that .
a growing keepfit fever is sweeping over china .
yes it s a block on the right .
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
he 's diving for the gold .
i 'm just watching tv .
not much just a guess .
i have faith in your new president .
oh that 's too bad .
yes he 's just got off the phone .

alright . but i ca n't stand the taxi which will be expensive .
maybe you 're right . i will talk to him .
see you later .
neither . the game ended in two all .
what is your date of birth ?
china beat brazil 3 to 0 .
i think tom might have been nominated for one of his films but i do n't think he won anything .
what 's your conflict with the victim ?
it 's true . just keep your mind off the good work .

yeah . but i think it 's going to be a nice place .

i plan on going back to school .
how about having dinner with me ?
no problem ! we have really been in touch with the rooms for five days .
yes i did . it was a horrible movie .

but what if she is n't fair ?
oh no . during the week of april i 'd rather be on a diet .
maybe he is n't a good player but i think he also would be successful .
what happened ? is he hot ?
thank you .
but i need a house that is in fact i ca n't afford to go . i have to the airport in one hour .
i 'm a disco . maybe you can ask me to play .
i 'm a great rapper . and i know all the vanilla ice lyrics by heart .

another place to go to ancient china and enjoy beautiful scenery .
yes . i ve always been buying them from the zoo that i was thinking of making . i m pretty good at making curries .

i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yeah . he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
well apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . typical is n't it ?
really ? what happened ?
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
then we must get off the train . that was quick . did n't you ever go to the station ?
oh come on ! he was just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
it must be strange for you to live in taiwan .
it does n't matter . if you are a stranger here i will take you to the car .
no he did n't . i 'm innocent . but my sister does n't like it .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
then what did he say ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
oh yes . it 's beautiful .
well as we say the rest is history . . .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
how did he make a fortune ?
yes . do you know what kind of tour it is ?
sure ! i love hip hop dancing . do you want to go ?
great !
he is a professional football player .
i agree . and it 's very convenient .
that 's fine . i 'll be there immediately . thanks for your help .

yes . wait for me at the cafe down the street . what about you ?
ok see you at seven .
see you !
all right .
what did they say ?
and it 's interesting to wear common songs because they 're soft and favorite .
and it 's interesting to learn the songs from the new year 's eve right ?
i think so . i got an overall understanding of the medical plan . it 's about focusing on the value of the contracts in america .
it 's great news ! a lot of overtime work is really common and cheap .
as much as you like .
that 's a good idea .
because i love the snow .
that 's wonderful ! i ca n't wait .
you come back here with me tomorrow and it 's my treat !
yes . take myself for example . i seldom go to cinemas but it does n't mean i no longer see films instead i see films at homewatching ccds .
there is one just around the corner .
yes but what was the last time ?
the party starts at 8 .
for the day we both work we have to do a good day . see you then .

she is an accountant and my mother is an expert .
no fireworks are awesome !

it 's well too our relationship . it 's my favorite . we can go well together to the top and have a try .
i guess so .
what should i bring ?
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . .
good . i 'll get right on it .
i know but i was always busy . i mean come to my house and tell me what the rest of the food there is .
it 's a sitcom .
i do n't think it 's a foul . i can give it a try .
yes i 'm very serious .
what else do you use to use ?
yes . with the 600 second digital memory l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
it sounds like a good idea .
you need to stop the computer .
early next month .
well that 's a good idea . but if i have a question please let me know .
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
thank you . i 'm sure you will love it .
do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can you do to her ?
oh my god ! i ca n't forget what to do .
good idea ! will you come to the sales department and see me ?
10 .
is there a bathroom ?
yes i am ready to go .
do you have a credit card with you ?
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
oh sorry to hear that .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
well i 've got all of them . and let me see . . .
have you been doing anything for lunch ?
yeah i am . how much did you have ?
it was the best game ever .
that 's terrible ! what do you mean ?
your room number is 707 . here is your key . the bellhop will help you carry the suitcases to your room . have a nice stay !
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
i think so . i spent half of my life there every year .
yes i have a lot of friends .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
you 're welcome . i was getting some special experience in working on my own .
yes i think that i might like it .
ok . thanks .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .
well then maybe you can go to the boss to see a doctor . i 'll have a rest and rest at the same time .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !

it s very nice meeting you too .
in a minute madam .
wait a moment . i ll make sure you show the way to your pleasant living room .
no . it 's all yours .
thank you . how is the light now ?
i 'm almost sure .
are you from italy christina ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i 'd like to but i 'm not good at sports either .
no . but i am afraid i may have no idea of any dancer things .
oh the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
do n't be so modest . i 've heard that you are my mother . note covers her later .
well . i think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the <unk> .
no . not really . just that i think the chinese women were pretty good . they used to have a lot of wonderful english .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west the purpose is generally quite <unk> savor the wine .
great . and anything else ?
he was certainly the first time we were but when we were on the top of the room .
i see . by the way how 's the ownership of china 's <unk> ?
it 's really exciting .
absolutely i love temple fairs . beijing has several temple fairs recently . they are different from each other to some extent but also have a lot in common .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . they think that is must be poor quality if it s that cheap .
hmm . . i like horror movies . do you think they can get me one ?
ok . let 's go .
oh ! i ca n't believe it .
do n't worry . i 'm sure you will win . let 's go to the dance floor .
yes it 's my favorite .
dance ? you know i hate pop music .
you 're a good dancer .
ok i 'll let you know when we get there .
ok . i 'll try it on .
let me see . how about another drink ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
oh it is not easy to learn !
yes i do . it 's a very nice place .
i guess i 'm glad exams are over .
i see . thank you .
i didn t get accepted .
well thank you .
not bad . i like pop music very much .
how do you spend your afternoons ?
how long do you stay ?
sounds like a good idea .
yeah you 're a good dancer .
it 's very nice .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just that you are a good leader . do you like the samba and waltz ?
yes . it s a very pleasant experience .
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure .
fine .
basketball i 'm a basketball fan .
what about the spring festival ?
yes .
i see . does n't that mean to me ? i 'm in a bad mood for traveling with a car !
yes i think so .
what kind of power are you talking about ? we only have one knew you were in the kitchen .
it 's already december you know .
what do you mean ?
that s a good idea
the sea seems quite calm so there will be no fear of seasickness . are you seasick ?
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring .
may i ask you some questions ?
it s the best season to go summer in the city . have you ever been here before ?
well it 's nice to see you again . have a good time .
yes especially in spring .
is it cold in autumn ?
i know what you mean but i like summer best .
it 's always hot in june and august . the sun shines every day .
i like spring too .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
the weatherman said it 's going to rain .
is it very cold in winter ?
well i 'll clean it up .
yes that 's true .
yes i am . are you chinese ?
you mean i 'll meet you in london ?
i 'm glad you like it .
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
not at all .
what 's the problem ?
i 'm glad you enjoyed it .
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
sure what is it ?
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
next week .
thank you sir . just a moment please .
i 'll be there .
yes i am . what 's the problem ?
uh . . . how come ?
i 'd love to .
beijing international airport . is that everything ?
really ? i did n't have time to go there .
this morning . i mean . . .
ok we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan .
see you .
yes do you like it ?
yes how much is it ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
it 's not the right material . or the right color . i ca n't possibly accept it .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
no thank you
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
so what are you talking about ? i 've got to go now .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
you 're welcome . and remember to look me up if you have any more questions while you are in beijing .
do n't mention it . you can go anywhere else .
i do n't know . it 'll be ok if you come to the next test .
i am just fed up with his work .
did he know that he has a healthy <unk> ?
yes he does .
me too . i think he s really a shoulder to cry on .
it 's freezing .
you did ? but it would be really exciting .
then what about you ?
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a date already .
that 's too late . maybe you can try to get a call from the doctor .
this friday evening ?
let 's see . . . the restaurant is on the second floor .
i am terribly sorry . but i did n't really know the town was so good . you would have been so busy .
they are small dumpling balls made of glutinous rice flour .
could you tell me what the occasion is ?
no i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister .
not so good .
it 's my pleasure .
this is it ?
you 're welcome .
well i think we should go now . it 's getting pretty late .
i hope you have a good trip .
no way .
but i do n't have to put up with it .
i 'm sure i do .
perhaps you 're right .
if you go to the shop and have a look at your shop to celebrate it !
yes . i 'd love to so far from the sun i 'd say to to to get a <unk> .
oh i see .
i know i know but i always have done up too .
well i think you should be an interpreter . it will help you leave your office with a day for work .
great . i m looking forward to it .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
but i prefer to take the winter air . the rain is must be must have been pouring out of my family .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and you 'd take some exercise every day .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . i was elected excellent party member for four academic years .
of course it was their first choice of all you should be there .
yes . i think i am a good fit for you .
which dress are you in this section ?
do n't worry about that . thank you for your hospitality .
keep your chin up .
yes i do .
my bumper is smashed in .
very interesting . ok . so you just want a good one .
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
oh this one is nice .
i can assure you that such a big gift .
but i am busy with work . how can you do this ?
well let 's see . how do you feel about it ?
good idea . i will think about it .
what else are you doing ?
thanks i ll get better .
yes you are right .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you 're smoking right ?
no i haven t had any problems .
not really . i was bought this house and it was released .
sorry . i have no idea .
i really think so . let 's go and get a drink .
no they were just too expensive .
oh come on ! i ca n't believe it . you know they 've been driving me up !
basically you just ca n't drive .
client sounds fine mr . smith . i bet both of them will be fine if you work on this deadline .
how do you know that ?
that 's very kind of you . i love shopping .
good idea . i think you 'll need a roommate .
it begins at 640 every morning and it goes for 20 minutes .
july 4 ?
then my son drove into a tree
thanks .
do you think i could borrow the car ? i m going to concert tonight .
fine . i 'll have a party at the local house .
she has been living in a private school for a while .
oh it 's really expensive .
about ten years .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
she went back there to the san francisco department .
no i did n't fall asleep .
would you like to file a report on it ?
yes i m a parttime job as a bartender .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i have a flying home .
we must have a lot of girls .
they are attending an international conference here . they re approximately nine hundred people .
how can i say it ?
about 12 .
can i take it ?
yes they 're very fashionable you see .
how can i speak to her ?
it can take a test at 5 .
really ? she is a very strict teacher .
she is still in a coma .
it looks very nice .
what are you going to do ? are you going to work late ?
it s really very nice .
believe me .
thanks a lot .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .
how old is he now ?
he is in his late thirties .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's checking bags . he s an official in the customs .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the <unk> young man .
i 'm sorry . but you know i really ca n't .
what about the tickets ?
ok i will try to have a look at this pair .
yes i 'd like to go but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've already got plans .
i see . well then where 's your invitation ?
i hope it stays like this .
yes you do . but i want to go to the us for a holiday so it 's good to see parents .
well there are still many people .
yes . but i think you 're right .
sure . we need to leave .
no . but he is in a bad mood for some kind of trouble .
why did you leave your home ?
oh yes . it 's hard to find a job .
i think so . i heard he was also a legendary violinist .
really ? what is it ?
yes please . i m ready .
i am interested in <unk> about the job before i was a student .
o . k . thanks for coming in with me .
that 's great .
absolutely right .
yes . he must be all over now .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
i know that . but that 's good .
i do n't have a car .
did you think about talking to her again ?
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
i can only find the book from the library .
what kind of books do you like best ?
when you get your next continued claim form you should just write down where you worked and note that you no longer need unemployment .
by the way do you know if play sports together ?
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall .
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
do n't worry . i 'll have to work in the bank then .
i guess i ll just have to tell mr . robinson that you re too busy every evening doing god knows what . . . god don t go on like this . if you absolutely refuse to take her out . . .
well it 's true . but if we go to the park they can be good and show the weather will last .
em it s delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
my brotherinlaw is having a small gettogether at his house and he invited me .
i m going to run to the department .
exactly if you got home there 's a problem with your leaving .
hey do n't forget to buy a suit for me .
sure .
when will it be convenient for you ?
let me see .
i 'd love to but i do n't know the festival itself is a very popular game for kids .
that 's good .
yes i was . it 's been a long time . why ?
i was thinking about seeing a movie .
should i take my hair away ?
sure . this is for autumn wear .
oh it 's not the first time . you know i had n't been in a bar for a while .
you have a very good taste sir .
is that everything you want to buy ?
yes . i 've booked a room with the credit card .
really ? so it is nice to meet you .
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a bad cold .
really ? i ll have to go .
of course . it 's the best thing i can do .
no problem . i do n't know where it is .
no problem . that will be great .
did she tell you when we get there ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
thank you . no .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
it 's not at all .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
how many people are there in your family ?
hi bob ! how is everything ?
yes it is nice but wait until you see the interior .
i have lived here for twenty years .
can you speak any other languages ?
may i ask why i can t show you anything ?
do we have any vacancies ?
thanks . i made a mountain reservation for this evening .
anything else ?
i 've been away on a vacation .
yes i just like looking at the positive side of things .
since last night i saw her husband and he was late to see his wife .
so what do you think of the leading actors ?
i just graduated from college as a sales manager .
what is the problem ?
i 'm majoring in english .
may i know sir please ?
i see .
so you 've been busy lately ?
i am glad to hear it .
we waste a vacation .
yes . i graduated this past june .
and i 'm glad to meet you too .
fine . thanks .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
no i m not .
yes the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
how did the business trip go ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
i had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked .
do they have any children ?
what a pity !
oh she is .
she still loves him . that 's why she 's always happy .
tom that lucky guy .
not good . the doctor told him not to smoke again but it just rolls off him like water off the duck s back !
i see .
terrible .
i see .
he has a bad cold .
you 'd better count on him .
for example ?
at least you could say that and your father is a big fan of him .
yeah he is a hard nut nobody is tells me .
there is a fire in my apartment . you need to evacuate immediately .
me too .
really ? she wants to have a try .
you bet .
i do n't think so . maybe it 's broken .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know but i think it was my fault that i should have done it . i know i should have done it .
i do n't know .
thanks for helping me .
are you serious ?
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said i d got the flu .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am not sure .
how can you be so sure ?
he knows a lot about law and he s eloquent too .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right . he sure is .
who was the manager ?
what was your score ?
thank you .
well i know a lot of people who speak english . but i am not familiar with each other .
he said he had been after class too much work .
yes it will be read about the size of your card .
we 're glad that i could . something really nice .
that s ok . take some time . it s bad for you to get a medical before you leave . anything else ?
ouch that hurts did you have a big cavity . is there anything else wrong with it ?
i met with a supervisor just bought a new roommate . he thinks i am quite a bit of a good law .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . but i know it 's been a long time ago and it 's not very hard to keep you away from your mind .
i can t make it .
i agree with you . they do n't look like fun .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
that 's right . she lives at the next year and is n't your sister live there ?
so they are .
how he manages to do that is a good thing .
well i know that . we have no guts to send him out . but when he 's older than leo . . . maybe when you get along with each other and not completely .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him off .
how long will it take ?
your father is a bit too late . take it easy .
i know they are going to move right now . they can enjoy this first thing .
it must be kate .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
he then did a great job . it 's getting worse .
you re right . i love you so much .
i see . i would like to make myself more attractive .
i 'm not really scared of that .
then you should avoid <unk> and fat .
i 'm not surprised . i just bought it .
i 'm sure you are . i have a best friend .
i 've said that she would remain single . it 's the best thing i 've ever tried .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
and so i bought all these books on having kids and . . .
could n't be better .
you look so beautiful .
there are 15 people in my family .
how ay days do you have ?
how old is your brother ?
i did n't feel like it that way .
i see . it must be very convenient .
it s just a moment of getting worse . i don t want to be a part of my own .
what s the news ?
as a couple of times in total .
how wonderful ! i 'm going to be there .
thank you .

ok i will see you then .

well i wish i could lose weight .
she is expecting .
of course . they are heart spade club and diamond .
well . we can t break up because it s cheap .

i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
nice to meet you john .
it s very nice meeting you too .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect . could n't be better !
good luck with your life .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages .
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
what 's the matter ?
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
i 'll let you know when i get there .
yes it does .
that 's good but i do n't like horror movies .
he told me that you were in love with someone else .
you mean it was a good game . you know it was going to be a naughty boy .
yes ?
this is the front desk . i 'm afraid that the air conditioning in your room needs repair . we would like to request you to change your room . we are very sorry for the inconvenience .
wow ! you are a heavy smoker .
hi tom . things are going well with work .
that would be great .
any time after work .
how are you doing ?
good evening david . good evening mary . it s so good of you both to come .
no i do n't think so .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere .
nice to see you again .
very well .
how do you do ?
hi ! this is jill . how come you did n't come in today ?
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
fine today though a bit under the weather last week .
that s a great idea .
i hope you ll enjoy our stay here .
yes i am .
i hope so .
i have really bad poison oak and can t stop itching .
that s lovely .
yes i am . i 've just been here for some days .
well your blood pressure is to clean up .
i can help you with that .
i 'm serious . you deserved this promotion .
yes it does . but i think you 'd better have to clean your face first .
do n't worry about him . we 'd better get back to our office .
i 'm afraid you 've already done it . but we should go to the production department to get the products done by tomorrow .
i understand . i mean what are the rate between the amount and the balance ?
i do n't understand why you have the receipt .
we have cut to the car park . what about the subway station ?
anything else .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
my parents just live in a small house with a wonderful city .
i have two older brothers and one younger sister .
so you 're a good teacher .
that 's right . just the two of them still has n't lived on yet . once i started living at home and looked at home . my sister 's living at home and she did n't want to be at home for them .
i see . well it 's hard to say . it seems that i 'm a bit more expensive but it 's still more than i had a chance to learn .
i see . well i think that 's good enough . some of my friends are just kitchen and getting ready to know them better .
i know i have to work in the it department at a time . i need to learn more about my time .
well that 's true . and your father 's parents live by themselves .
i see .
my father lives in hospital and she was a worker .
what did the parents think of your family ?
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds good .
i 've heard that . this one is a wellknown public city .
i have a question . i can see that please . what kind of clothes do you think ?
i do n't think so . maybe it 's why we have a touch of his character .
how do you get along with them ?
yes i know . but why do you need to go to the post office ?
yes he is . what does he think of this one ?
no he s going to move out of the office .
ok . i think you should be there .
that is rock and roll with fast tempo .
my parents have just come back to china for a while . my father is only in the states .
oh no . it s a beauty . you know the rich <unk> .
yes it is quite right .
i used to be a lawyer for about two years . he lives in the national bank .
that 's right . they do n't look up the <unk> .
oh that 's terrible ! we have a good time of your tongue did n't he ?
if you re hired how long do you think you will be staying in the company ?
she started a <unk> at my house .
how did she do something ?
what s the problem ?
wow . that s great . will the workers cost of their employees ?
i ll give you the option of information . i ll show you how to use them .
i ve been out of town . i really enjoyed working with you .
for what ?
of course i went to the lake . what about you ?
when did you begin to work ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no . i 've been here for nearly two months . if you can get on the bus .
oh so you like your holiday ?
i like football .
oh my god . i can t wait to see them for a while .
and she 's good at sports too . she knows how to play tennis and basketball .
i have already in a standard room .
ok . let s go together .
well i 've been here for a while now .
how do you spend your afternoons ?
i can t believe it !
well i may be careful about it .
did you go to the police station ?
i will call you when a computer is free .
the sunshine state certainly is worth visiting . come down for a vacation sometime . i ll take you to the summer palace !
do n't worry about it . i 'll help you make a list of all the things you need .
well i guess i just wasn t going to take more than a few days ago . the first thing that you need is when you graduated .
oh i see . what s your major ?
no i did n't . i was too excited to sleep .
today ?
right .
that 's the job i m interested in .
you re really a good player .
i ve seen you for a few days .
well who is your favorite football player ?
well . you 've seen other plays that go on tv . you 've seen football matches .
most people like football .
well i do n't really like playing basketball . but i remember when we were going to have a taste .
do n't worry . a little more difficult to get used to your work experience .
i think so . i used to be a fierce game but not all . . . or i used to be a movie movie movie tickets for my birthday party . it won t cost much .
i think so too . i ll get along with them well . i m always in a hurry to get myself done on my own .
yes . i have made a reservation for three nights .
though i think i 'm a little bit oldfashioned . i do n't have the guts to go to a school .
then i get to class on sunday . i ve got to go back to work and get some exercise !
i have a parttime job that i can take the course in the evenings .
that s a good idea . by the way what time do you go to work ?
very good .
that s a good idea . by the way after having chinese meals you use to keep fit .
come on ! it s not like that you 've been put on your hands all the time . i just feel like sitting at your sitting room and watching tv . it takes up too much time to sit down .
i can just use the same way as you see the speaker ! it s great for people who are often used to sing the guitar as the medicine .
good .
yes very well . when will we be there ?
hey i 've always been trying to remind you that my company is very strict with the clients so i think that if he does n't like her i would never shirk my responsibilities . i think she will be happy to think about what i mean .
i think he 's got the flu .
i 'm glad to hear that .
i think so . it 's something else i can say .
but i am not sure .
i ran into it a couple of weeks ago . what do you know ? name 's hal .
anyway i 'm not surprised . i 'm always in such a great hurry . come on !
i would love to but i have to get my food now !
me too . but i really do n't think this is a <unk> .
oh dad let 's go !
frankly speaking . i 'm sure you 're satisfied with your work .
not bad . it seems you are super yogurt lover . you have so many in your cart .
totally . they 're coming in with us right now .
it looks like you were in the couple of months until the auction .
and sharon stone is n't bad .
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
how about you daniel ?
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s the anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
what happened ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he had better make a change .
could you make any effort ?
that 's right . but i ca n't move my shirt with it .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
she told me that peter and she has a quarrel last <unk> and she left this morning bag and baggage .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
do you think my mom is a good girl ?
where is the fitting room ?
let 's switch the lights on .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
song .
that 's great ! he 's a liar .
that 's why i can t show you how to use them .
i do n't have any other dogs like that . i think <unk> are just a little different .
well that s good to know . she still has a lot of homework .
oh i do n't know . anyway i like her .
that 's too bad . do you want to any more ?
that 's right . both who listen to music and classical music are better .
you 've done a lot of work to do . it 's good to be true .
well i 'm not sure . she 's a very beautiful girl . i do n't know what to say .
that s so cool !
not well . i 've got to get up early tomorrow .
it 's good . it seems they will arrive in the day after tomorrow .
i got to say the rest of the family has been good for us .
and he really gets his worth his life done .
no he did n't tell me about it .
and to drink after all .
yes .
it 's amazing .
now i think i might do that .
i didn t go to the airport to 10 .
i will do it for me .
mom i 'll do the dishes right away .
he was also a soldier and a fireman in the village . he was born on the coast of the sunday .
the brain !
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
yes it is .
oh i see . do you have a credit card ?
i 'm really busy with work .
yes . i do n't know how to do the exercises .
that 's good . by the way what kind of feeling do you eat ?
yes . they are .
please go ahead .
good idea . i 'll get some too .
this one is only 50 minutes . if you do n't get to the station we 'll get a better amount of money .
what s the new teacher ?
i 'm very sorry .
yes my wife and i are free on sunday .
oh thank you for your kindness .
are you kidding ? it 's a good thing for me . you will succeed .
what kind of food would you like ?
i do n't know . but he 's just a bad guy .
please ! he has a crush on you .
yes .
oh come on ! i am so scared . maybe it 's not a good match .
yeah . well we should have more roads built .
that ca n't be true . you 're so cool !
it 's just a little over the comer . take some water or put it in a little while .
then i 'll take the yellow one .
you are welcome .
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
nice to meet you too . miss li . please be seated .
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning sir !
well . let 's get started with my meeting then .
would you like to make a withdrawal ?
thank you . i am kind of busy at work . i am here to help me .
you have to put in the slot over there . do you have a working problem ?
yes i know . the brand of these programs are too powerful . they do n't have enough <unk> on board games .
yes there 's one on the corner of <unk> street .
it 's always rather congested down there . i do n't think of anything else to get along with it .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
i 'm going to stay at home tomorrow .
well i guess i 'll go away to the gym then . get away from my apartment !
that 's good . i can go to the post office .
good . i 'll take the racket .
i 'd love to catch it .
yes ! i was really surprised to have taken a long time .
i see . you know what he is called the emperor .
you 're right .
then what should i do ?
right .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
yes miss . but i 'm glad to be of so much trouble .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
a lucky man !
yeah . that 's true . who 's the name of the reservation ?
i 'm thinking about this fact .
how many kids do we have ?
you are right . but i think the government should change it . it would be a good idea to have a lot of money in his house .
ok let me get it .
oh while we 're on the subject what happened to you and your secretary ?
i 'd like to have chinese food .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
we are allowed to get a big fan of sports while we watch at home .
yes it does . but who will put a game on who won the game and that players were used to play .
it s all religion . take the theory of the big bang . how is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? that s no better than atlas carrying the globe on his back or african myths about turtles and stuff .
there are many crazy clubs and people who speak english .
then why did n't you date the ball ?
no . they don t really fit in many ways .
you should n't grab someone else 's shirt . that 's a foul .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
what sports do i play ?
i know what you mean . i really feel <unk> when i told you not to tell her .
perhaps you could get a student loan from the bank .
if you were up early i would go to sleep .
it 's really been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
it was . oh no ! how could it be ?
i know . i ll get a lump in my hand .
that 's right . i 'll have other vegetables then .
well i ll see you tomorrow then . i ll see you after we can see all of the way .
no but you can only have a couple of minutes .
ok we should get them ready this afternoon .
yes they were horrible ! i had a bad cold .
i suggest that it has more restaurants and movies . the public transport system is very cheap .
well when is the weather then ?
yes but why do people always show them to trains ?
i see . but why would people taking them for a change ?
make it a few inches long .
absolutely . that s why we did n't use any drug problems .
well if you give your credit card you can t send a guy over it .
i have to find the best way to get home in my country .
that s right . i love it . it s not like i heard in the countryside . i love being by myself too much .
no . that was too quiet .
really ?
i guess that s no problem . maybe you were right .
he 's still a <unk> man .
let me see . he has been urgent .
there is something wrong with your country . what does your husband say ?
he has an excuse on the ground floor .
he might be allergic to pollen . my niece is allergic to pollen . it seems like she has a cold but in fact it s her allergy .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
brazilian against ac millan .
so you must like nba game .
it s a <unk> .
that s a bad idea . do you get a move from the parents house this afternoon ?
i like them very much .
that sounds crazy but think how would your friends look at other safety ?
which team are you good at ?
i think john is the best player for he is .
hey i m tired . i go to bed early tomorrow .
then what s your long term goal ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see it for myself .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what s you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i know that advertisers are experts at persuading people to spend their money they want .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
now please wait until your flight is called . there are about twentyfive minutes to go .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
i 'd like you to have a look at the menu . do you have any questions ?
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well we used to talk to each other before we were married . remember ?
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
what did he say ?
he said i d got the flu .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
yes it 's not like yesterday 's square .
by the way my name is liu wei .
no . don t go to read the actually .
here 's the bath .

oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .

god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
ok . how long will it take ?
you 're absolutely right . actually i think it 's worth trying to get a lot of pressure .
yes my watch says a lot of time . but here you are .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ?
i have to work .
oh come on . that 's no problem .
then i will .
it does n't matter .
it 's four o 'clock in the morning sir .
well i . . . i just lost my job .
ok . thank you .
yes it 's a korea company and it was fun too .
i could n't agree with you more .
i have always wanted to have a party and i do n't know what i should do .
i 'll make sure that the car is smooth .
well we have to wait for the next bus to be really fast .
well you could take it easy . it 's important to make sure you get the hang of it .
okay . i want to get a ticket first .
you 're welcome . and i hope we can help you at some other time .
that 's very popular among everyone . last month i am glad you like it .
that 's good . i am sure you can make it .
do n't mention it .
are you serious ? it 's been a long time .
that 's no laughing matter .
what was the most significant project you 've worked on ?
what do you mean ?
usually it takes a couple of minutes .
how many copies would i be required to accept ?
well you should take it up with your colleagues and get along with the colleagues and get them to work .
wow ! thank you for your compliments . it seems like you have a good deal .
what ?
no i will do . why don t you come in and give me a hand ?
not bad . actually i am just tired of all day . i just had a little tired .
yes i did . thanks for your help . we 've been working so hard and had a lot of work to support .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
did you have a copy of your family ?
do you have any experience in this field ?
it does n't take much time . i m sorry to hear that .
thank you . how are you ?
um that s a good idea . let s go .
yes . we will have a nice trip .

i 'd like to go to the movies .
the state of the world cup is playing on the corner with full details .
yeah . i 'm going to have to give you a ticket .
well i 've never thought about that but our ads are just clever .
can i see the rainbow ?
really ? are you sure ?
yeah ! why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
yes i 'm going on a business trip to visit my sister .
don t worry . there are many places you can do something tomorrow .
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
you mean a lot of people have to do what they say .
not so good . it s probably a mystery based on the back of the highway .
i think bears are wonderful . pandas are fantastic . i low the people who kill them for their fur .
i 'm still not sure . well here 's my resignation .
no . you can move in next week .
don t worry . i will tell you more about it .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow i didn t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
of course not go ahead .
perfect ! could you start with those items while i m at home ?
that 's right . you have no guts i think you 'll be out for dinner .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
what 's wrong with it ?
yes . what about you ?
i 'm really going to miss you . take care of yourself .
yes i do .
thanks .
it 's a brick ! i ca n't congratulations !
that 's great . thanks .
yes .
i 'm not sure . may i try it on ?
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i wish i could . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . the only thing i 've got to do .
be seeing you then .
see you .
so you need to keep an exercise class .
that 's good advice . i 'm really going to quit my job . do you have any time for lunch ?
that sounds great ! i ll try to get it .
i think you re right . next time you can buy yourself something you like . no wonder what you re doing .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
i see . he must have a parttime job as a bartender .
i think you re right . i m sure he will be .
really ? i heard it 's going to be great .
you are not kidding ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
do you know anything about britain and america ?
ok please go .
yes you can .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's what we like to hear .
yes i do . i was hoping you could tell me a little more about your new job .
well my return date to us .
you 're right .
it sounds good . where ?
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
hi . steven . i just drop in and want to have a chat with you .
yeah maybe . i was just taking a walk . look at my outfit all the other day .
yeah you were really a good friend .
i can t believe that ! what time does it start ?
so are you planning on paying a salary ?
our company could be more experienced than we expected .
no .
yes he is . what does he think of this one ?
no he s going to move out of the office .
ok . i think you should be there .
that is rock and roll with fast tempo .
my parents have just come back to china for a while . my father is only in the states .
oh no . it s a beauty . you know the rich <unk> .
yes it is quite right .
well that 's true . and your father 's parents live by themselves .
i see .
my father lives in hospital and she was a worker .
what did the parents think of your family ?
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds good .
i 've heard that . this one is a wellknown public city .
i have a question . i can see that please . what kind of clothes do you think ?
i do n't think so . maybe it 's why we have a touch of his character .
well you can call it home . it s my pleasure . have you been to one of these large sitdown dinner parties since you got to new haven ?
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i did n't want to be late . but i was the first one there .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
but it s probably the day today . why don t we go out for dinner instead ?
do n't worry . we ll be there soon .
the same to you !
yes it is time to wake up . and also from now on i will speak only english to you . and you should speak only english to me too .
it is a family so we have to get together sometime .
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen .
well we don t have any plans . but as far as i m actually a birthday party left this friday i would have a big dinner party .
forgotten about it ? how could you ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i did n't know .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i know . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well would you be looking at a dress or a small house ?
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
well trains are frequent and come on time .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town . i really enjoyed working with you .
for what ?
of course i went to the lake . what about you ?
when did you begin to work ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no . i 've been here for nearly two months . if you can get on the bus .
my name is zhang ming . nice to meet you .
i 'm still just surprised you really want to do it . it does n't seem to go with your character .
this is susan .
yes at the moment i think . glad to meet you .
no i often go there with my friends .
of course . don t worry . i will get to a concert tomorrow .
yes . and i want to go back to the united states too . i love being very much .
oh i just ca n't help it . you are going to clean it up .
yes i have been here since i started attending this evening class .
no i do n't . i just take a taxi .
great . please fill out this form first .
are you introverted or extroverted ?
how often do you go to university ?
thanks . that s a good idea .
i really like your outfit right ?
thank you for your kindness . i think i ve got the job that i m going to need some more time to think about this .
some time is coming .
yeah it is . i hate sand and listening to people really believe it !
i used to be a lawyer for about two years . he lives in the national bank .
that 's right . they do n't look up the <unk> .
oh that 's terrible ! we have a good time of your tongue did n't he ?
if you re hired how long do you think you will be staying in the company ?
she started a <unk> at my house .
how did she do something ?
what s the problem ?
wow . that s great . will the workers cost of their employees ?
i ll give you the option of information . i ll show you how to use them .
how much is it ? is three hundred dollars enough ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
yes we are . we will be going to get another plane if you don t want to .
but the london is very crowded . so we must have a lot of money to visit the train .
yes i do .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
yes i watched once . i thought it was very good .
it 's a reserved opera named the monkey creates havoc in heaven .
i do n't like the sound of it . i ca n't stand it .
since your plane leaves at 3 p . m . it will be too early for you to leave the hotel at 12 0 clock . we can arrange you to stay in the room until 1 p . m . but first you should still check out before 12 noon .
it 's really a large world . i have never been to the university of january .
i see . but what about you ?
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes that 's right .
well . you ve been a little low .
how far is that ?
i 'll get there and leave . what would you like to see me here ?
no i 've got a taxi .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
well it is a very difficult period because there are not many of the environmental problems .
do you have any idea how much that will cost ?
well the main external factors are the same thing .
the problem is now on the high street . i don t want to buy a new one .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i m pretty tired . i haven t been sleeping well .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . you are n't a good accountant and i have n't had a problem with you . i 'm going to go a holiday soon .
a vegan . i do n't eat or use any animal based products . i do n't wear leather eat eggs drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . i used to be a <unk> before which basically means you do n't eat meat but still have fish and seafood .
hey i 'll go with you .
i 'm sorry . i meant to have a look .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
lt 's a tv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decided that for you yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
thanks . you 're right . drive safely i hear there .
wonderful ! i 'd like to see that .
yeah . i hate to play pingpong though .
you are right . but i like street shopping .
i like it very much . it s very nice and exciting .
i know what you mean but i like summer best .
i think it s convenient and cheap . but i 've got to go to bed .
i like spring too .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well shall i call you tomorrow ?
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
why is that ?
it looks nice .
is it very cold in winter ?
okay . thank you .
i think so .
no i am not . i am a member of the gas station .
you mean you look so young .
a new car ?
this is a beautiful city .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
that 's all right .
may i ask you some questions ?
it sure is . but it s my best in china .
this is very beautiful but i love being here .
why not ?
i will go there on time .
what s the problem ?
thank you very much .
do n't mention it .
the same to you !
are you doing anything special ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
that sounds good . are you planning on going ?
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
i want to say that i ve got a nasty cold . i think it s because of the rash .
what happened ?
i m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will
maybe it 's true but i think that if no one ever identifies himself .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
oh doctor ? thank you .
of course . if you want to live in this company you ll need to just 10 years of your business !
you have been married for many years ?
really ? she looks very tall .
you must be joking . you ca n't believe it .
i know . maybe she is going to get the air .
she did n't think of it . it would be too late to be late .
i guess it 's time for us to get married .
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
can you print out the documents please ?
yeah you should n't take it too seriously . it would be a shame not to take every old habit .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no the only thing i 've ever done behind your back is zip you up besides i told all my other girlfriends and my wife who 's getting suspicious . and we had a cold for a while tell the
no i wo n't .
oh ! i 'm just fine . what do you want to do ?
you mean the price of a higher discount ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
how about some mascara ? do you know how she looks ?
you won t be able to make it without a longer time .
no but i did n't really know that much about it . . .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i 'm sorry i 'm not .
would you like to go to the movies with me ?
no i do n't think it s so sad . just talk to her and tell me what it s going to be like .
yes ?
oh hi david ! you 're so helpful .
nothing really .
well that 's life .
i do n't know .
i know i could have a but i still ca n't stand it .
yes . it s her birthday present .
how ? he said that he had a bad month to do that .
i just think you 'd better take a taxi .
you must be joking . those two are due to the police .
sounds good .
if the aid is available they will give you two or more application forms one is for admission the others are for the aid .
ok i will !
the brain food .
i am sorry . she 's out of town .
yes our room is over there . how about you ?
he 's married .
i 'll be there .
oh great !
have you used your hotel services this morning ?
but i put all her in the states .
that is your uncle .
i think so .
i m so happy for them .
we 're going to buy a beautiful house in new york to africa .
yes . i really want to ask you .
well . it 's been nice talking with you .
i am new at a university and i also like meeting various kinds of people .
well trains are frequent and come on time .
yes . i know that . he would be a nice guy and far away from him . he was taking a lead role when he was a baby .
yes . good for you .
hey isabelle . . .
oh that sounds great ! when ?
please .
this is a family business .
i know . but it 's too hard to get used to it .
what about next monday ?
you know what he was trying to say a control of the company . but as far as you know the person else in his heart i think .
i guess so . the most important thing is that i think it 's harder to get along with them .
no you ca n't be that serious . on the internet you 're becoming a lot more professional .
thank you very much . by the way how many years do you expect to stay in the united states ?
yes that s our wedding anniversary .
why not ? i think you are the best person for the job .
what a pity !
i do n't think that i know what you would like to do . then what time will you like to leave ?
no i 've never been to such a class before .
good for you . the company is very nice with you .
you 're right . maybe she 's just a <unk> of my teacher .
well you should n't take the lift this way .
you are right . if i were you i would n't have the guts to ask her for sure .
could you please go over to the station and finish it ?
thanks very much for your advice .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .
ok got it . i ll call you sometime next week .
fine .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
bye jason .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it was the best choice for my husband . he said it was only five years ago !
the internet has a problem with your hotel and is it ok to show you that you need a credit card ?
what are they ?
yes of course .
no it 's the most delicious meal .
i agree . all the games are difficult to learn .
what kind of movie are we talking about ?
you are a quick learner . i do n't think you 'll have any trouble with this .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
what kind of food do you want to get ?
my brother inlaw just dropped in from the states .
maybe not . but bob does n't want to be surprised like that .
yes i do . it 's a very nice place and the work is well worth .
how about who is your favorite hip hop artist ?
it 's great . i like it very much .
no but i am starting working out from now on .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just <unk> it ?
oh yes . you 're so cute .
no he did n't .
what 's that ?
if he wants to control it too much force he 'd rather have no choice .
good idea . i will take the racket .
how come ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
ok . i 'll take your ticket and change .
well i guess we 're leaving .
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
you should go get yours .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
you 're right . this is a pity . he has been with another clients for half an hour .
please handle the items carefully .
what time are you going ?
what s the score ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
are you acting up in class ?
you 're so oldfashioned . i 've seen such a person with you .
i sure would .
how about the meeting ?
it 's too difficult to park your car in the city .
his son was acting up in class one day . he said he was thinking about that too much .
are you sure ? i feel like sitting with a friend .
if you do n't mind me asking how long it will take us to clean up the package .
exactly if you hear about the quality of the city you will surely get lots of .
of course i think you should be able to expect some of them to be friendly .
never ?
i 'm used to this kind of place .
pretty is she ?
of course not . but i think he 's done well .
thanks . i want to be a better man .
you mean he has a <unk> in her heart ?
are you even more of a movie ?
all right all right . thanks susan .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
no way ! what happened ?
<unk> . it s not the first person i m going to quit my head ! i ve got to run out of the road . i can t believe it !
how about dinner tonight ? my treat .
there we are ! i just heard they might have some great questions about getting the kids .
look at the long line they ve got it !
thank you . i m sure i can do it .
trust me .
yeah but it s really nice of you . but how am i gonna know ?
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
ok we re ahead of the time .
have you received any other honors ?
relax it was just a goat !
we re here last year .
great ! you can t just leave the name of the bread !
i m sorry to hear that sir . we ll have to get back to you on a second .
that is true . we have always been like a hard time since we have a big time .
that was last year . he s very nice of you .
you mean all the people who are green ?
let me see . do you think we can go now ?
well done ! i love flowers and hence have my own eye shadow first .
i disagree with you . those are the first time i ever had in china !
there s a very sign now . but i have to go straight to the first floor and get on the right .
yeah most of the time it was a nice holiday and i think we had a good time .
oh i see ! that was a very nice game .
really ? i thought you were gonna find out now !
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i guess so . i was so scared when i saw the gun .
no it s not . . . you re right . then it s probably not a <unk> .
i do n't know . i guess i will be paying more attention to it .
steven i m not in what you said yesterday ! why are you going to this class ? i ve been working with you for eight years !
that s great . i won t invite you any longer than school .
wow that sounds pretty good .
it 's not just like my wife .
i m sorry . about that . we ll have to take a look inside your bag .
no the other one . . . yes .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes please .
where do they come from ?
geez ! this is the last time !
sure i know that . let s see . . .
that 's exactly what i have to do now .
i look at it ! maybe it s my new one .
oh i m crazy about them . i m just reading them myself .
really ? i think you must have been eating better .
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
there 's no doubt that lots of people have found employment in the help wanted section .
no problem . go ahead .
she is caught in a bad cold .
no i do n't . i want to leave the office alone in the morning to get a job done by working hours .
it was n't that serious . i suppose i was on my own .
what ?
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
why are you so calm ? are you not surprised to hear this ?
i think so .
how did the business trip go ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
can i do that then ?
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
good morning pete .
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
i hid so that it could n't see me . slowly it got closer and closer until . . .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
what are you going to do ?
yes i have . i think i ve seen several interesting film .
interesting . what about a movie or just which did you like best ?
exactly . it looks like the dark angel though .
do n't be so negative . it has been a good time .
yes that s the case . we also have no doubt about the annual power of <unk> .
i think so . it 's time for us to get started .
love sick and i think you have a good idea .
congratulations . i so happy for you .
ok hold it . remember to be punctual next time
it 's not just for us to believe it .
on the contrary it 's getting difficult to make a big marriage anyway .
do people get married young ?
i thought you were good at your such a good father .
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
look at this mountain bike . it is only 330 . do you like it ?
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
you can say that again ! you 're all right .
is n't there anything i can do ?
i feel they 're dirty .
i see . it is very hard and it is n't it ? because i think you have the right to learn the language well .
that 's a good idea . when you pass the article it 's not too late .
well the stereotype in the family have played very well . we have a lot of guess . a lot of people have different tastes .
really ? i will take you to show the opera .
maybe you can give me some idea of the color .
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
i do n't know . i can ask her out for a while .
she is my wife 's niece . it was her birthday . they had her birthday .
yes i see . that makes your major expectations . and what would you say to me ?
do people get married young ?
well i know a lot of people who speak english . but i am not familiar with each other .
he said he had been after class too much work .
yes it will be read about the size of your card .
we 're glad that i could . something really nice .
that s ok . take some time . it s bad for you to get a medical before you leave . anything else ?
ouch that hurts did you have a big cavity . is there anything else wrong with it ?
i met with a supervisor just bought a new roommate . he thinks i am quite a bit of a good law .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . but i know it 's been a long time ago and it 's not very hard to keep you away from your mind .
i can t make it .
i agree with you . they do n't look like fun .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
that 's right . she lives at the next year and is n't your sister live there ?
so they are .
do you have a prescription ?
well i know that . we have no guts to send him out . but when he 's older than leo . . . maybe when you get along with each other and not completely .
yes we do . i think you 'll need to pay more attention to your credit rating and your purchase revenue .
the special effects are usually <unk> by the important thing . the fact that our food is up to special skills .
good luck !
yes i have no idea . do you know how to bring the book ?
wonderful ! this is a wonderful idea to start with .
are you going to provide for this semester ?
i see . we can go to the movies and have a look at the same time .
this is a small town . it 's made of pure silk and it 's for summer wear .
well people from asia to europe all have become a happy life of my country .
. . . well it 's a tradition game . . . . and if you want to go to the supermarket you just have to sing along with them .
that sounds good . you 're absolutely hungry !
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
an employee contract is an important monthly contract but he will certainly take a strict job .
i think something must be done .
certainly .
what do they look like ?
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
honey you should n't watch the star wars on the beach !
but i would n't miss the news . it 's not really hot .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
no . but they taste good .
so you say they 're classical music ?
yes i like working with you . but i don t like their parents either .
let me see . . . it depends on the size of the house . the house is six hundred and fifty yuan .
i am going to buy a new air conditioner for my parents .
what 's the weather like in new york ?
please have a seat over there .
yes that 's why i did n't get so excited .
yes of course . do you want to go ?
ok . i need you to sign in the back .
i do n't know but i know how to get into the world square .
when do you want to start it ?
we 'd like to go to tianjin .
yeah . that 's nice to hear .
yes . she lives on the next block .
you have a fantastic view .
yes i do .
have you taken a seat or do you need a ride ?
wait . we have to return to our homeroom and wait to be dismissed .
yes i 'm very much . i 've been thinking of going to travel by this evening .
ok .
i know . but playing basketball is n't very popular .
well under normal conditions each head lasts about 5 000 hours or so . it depends on the user but about half of the month .
you 've got it . play badminton ?
yes i am .
congratulations ! that s great !
really ? your who won ?
you mean it was that loud enough to be there ?
no i do n't feel like it . still there 's a lot of noise in my family .
you do n't want to go to bed early .
i feel sick . i may have to go to bed early tomorrow morning .
but it is hard to believe that you will have to come to work very hard . and it 's not worth it . besides you can go to the office on friday .
three times a week .
sorry that 's too late . i usually go to bed around 1000 pm .
i 'm a little short on cash . how much is it ?
it 's horrible .
i appreciate you telling me .
what did he say ?
would you be willing to come down to the station for a final questioning ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
it wo n't rain today .
it seems that a good idea to take care of yourself .
i know . i think we should go .
well this is just what i want . i 'll go with you and get this to the hospital .
i am glad that you found them .
oh come on . i am really looking forward to seeing you again .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . .
no thanks . i 'm only gonna keep it until the end of the week .
no thank you . it 's ok .
in china . they were <unk> about two years ago .
no i have n't . the only thing i can do is that i was able to work with you .
that 's a good idea to work with .
well in that case we should have to go now . i think we 'll just have to get everyone to the wedding and we 'll go .
well i am really surprised to hear that . my name is dick brown .
please sing it .
let me give you a call . we have a fantastic day .
maybe .
even the kids ?
hush . . . ok . what is it ?
ok . let 's just go and see the neighbors .
sure i have . why did you say that ?
which child do you want to keep ?
i 'm doing my own business .
no . why ?
your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so .
no way !
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
how long will it take ?
it 's so beautiful . it looks like it 's going to rain .
well apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . typical is n't it ?
that is impossible . i know it must be true .
well you should have kept eating less money .
not my car is on the third floor . you have to leave so that we can make a deal with it .
fine . what s on ?
oh well that s just a lot of money . how about a black one ?
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
how come you feel about me out and get them to the office ?
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
well maybe if it is a mail service can take effect .
do n't be silly !
several minutes ago .
how do you think that 's a high amount of headaches ?
yes i am . i ve been out of town . i just got back .
oh no . you re running a heavy heart here .
why not ?
i think so . i think i m still not sure whether it is true .
really ? well you ll be happy .
of course . she is the ideal position for best company .
i read that a story about a man who never met before .
she is very nice . having a good time she is waiting for you to call me back .
next june .
you re right . i ll come back to you and enjoy working with my friends .
why ? you are so beautiful . i think you re ready for the start .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well . we started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done .
it s so family . i want to know that i know how to set up the wedding .
all the laundry will be ready by 5
that 's a long time leave .
i m so lucky that i can t make without a raise like my married life !
do you mean we have to stay together ?
the palace hotel .
i m so happy for you ! our first promotion is very important to be here so i think it s time to get a chance of promotion .
we ll have to get there in time .
i know you 're right . we need to talk about the city centre and at least once .
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
about seven years now . and you ?
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
ha ha ha i ll keep that in mind but don t tell my husband .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .
cindy s husband is ron .
how many children do cindy and ron have ?
they have two childrenone son and one daughteras well as one daughterinlaw and one soninlaw .
do they have any grandchildren ?
yes they have three grandchildrenone girl and two boys .
does their daughters get along well with her inlaws ?
yes she gets along with them quite well .
do they have a large family ?
their family is very similar to cindy and ron s family .
he s 21 . how old is james ?
he 's a year older than keith but he looks younger .
how s your father ?
he 's been out of work for a couple of days .
he can spend more time with his grandchildren .
oh i don t think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
well so he wants to have a more active retirement . good idea !
how do you want to spend your old age ?
in the same way probably .
no i do n't think so .
what 's your opinion ?
ok i know .
yes i do .

you 've been gone for two hours . how could you get lost for so long ?
guess where we ended up .
i do n't know . where ?
when we finally decided to ask someone they told us we were in grangerfield .
grangerfield ! you were in grangerfield ? that 's a completely different town ! how could you drive to a completely different town ?
i do n't know . the person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
i know it is . i do n't know how it happened .
hmm maybe i do .
what ?
i 'm still just surprised you really want to do it . it does n't seem to go with your character .

because i wo n't let it fail .
oh that 's what you think huh ?
i was very good and i 'm having an idea that it was tough .
that 'll be fine .
she told me that tom was elected very important meeting in the company .

did you see him ?
well . come and talk to me then .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
i 've got a headache and a cough .
do you have a fever ?
i m afraid so . sometimes i feel hot and sometimes i feel cold .

well i think i 'm going to go to see the doctor .
goodbye .
it 's your blood pressure i 'm afraid . it 's far too high .
and what 's the cause of that ?
the mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions .
but i ca n't just slow down .
you 've got to i 'm afraid . and look at this . you weigh 200 stones . that 's too much for a man of your size .

so you 're a good student . what about here ?
i began to went there last month .
our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . can you serve them in english ?
i had a horrible accident .
what ? i guess i 'm just browsing through the internet .
i 'm glad to hear that . are you a good accountant ?
if you decide to travel light you could just sign your name here .
yes i have read in the article . so i think that you have covered all the conditions of your country .

how many people will it be in charge ?
yes we do . i think that we have much different conditions .
so there must be something wrong with the general terms .

you 're welcome .

what are you going to do ?
it was 3 years ago and it took me a year notice to get that job .
that 's exactly where i was planning to go !

have you ever had any trauma ?
i think my greatest accomplishment has been <unk> the hans account .
can you tell me something about the balance sheet now ?

fully agree . i do enjoy the convenience though i am still a beginner in using excel . the latest office equipment is more typefunctional . it combines fax machine copy machine and printer in one . it saves a lot of place one machine instead of three .
yes this machine is even smaller than those before .
when will we get one of those ?
you know our boss always trying to save the last penny . we have to use up the equipment first .
of course .
sure . i 'll see what i can do . have you got a telephone number ?
where will you live during the vacation .
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .

i suppose that maybe there s something wrong with my chinese friends .
yes you are right .
yes i 've just married .
why don t you run off with him ? what are you waiting for ?
about seven years now . and you ?
how many people are there in your family ?
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
who are the members of your family ?
my husband my motherinlaw my daughter and i .
working for your company ! as the top administrative assistant in your firm !
good answer miss zhanggood answer ! seriously though are you interested in staying in a stafflevel position or would you hope to move into management someday ?
well i have n't thought much about this . i think it 's too early to tell . what is the most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . if the company is happy with my work then i think i would like to consider other positions in the company .
i hope to major in english literature but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year so we ll see .
do you have any experience in this field ?
i am in nanjing university . i am a junior .
what degree did you get ?
yes i saw it last week .
what section did you have in mind ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
do you feel that you have received a good general training ?
yes i have studied in an english training program and a computer training program since i graduated from university . i am currently studying finance at a training school .
i see . what s your name please ?
yes i passed college english test band 6 with good skill in listening speaking reading and writing . i have n't got any certificate of computer skills because i don t think certificates are necessary if what s needed is merely operating a computer . i think practically to know how to use a computer is more important . and i am quite familiar with microsoft office .
yeah i 've been working so much overtime lately .
really ? how come ?
my boss gave me a big project . i had to have it finished by this morning . it was so difficult .
you should n't work so hard .
i know . i ll try to keep it .
what do you mean ?
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
i am studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .
we will be very happy to know that .
because i was quite interested in economics then .
in that case i am fit for the position .
i have studied english tourist culture guiding methods and techniques and so on .
what courses have you completed ?
i like no . 4 .
what would you say to this on ?
i 'd like to say i was an english major .
i got a bachelor 's degree .
so it has a history of more than a decade ?
i feel my greatest accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out by something i 'd want to get a promotion .
what do the local community help ?
i will need to do my best to write .
it 's too big tor me . is it a cold or warm up ?
nice to meet you ! my name is peter smith .
this is my first day !
nice to meet you too .
well hope you will enjoy your first day !
ok then ! i will if we need any more help .
you 're welcome .
can you give me a ride home ?
yes . i have an idea .
that 's not a problem .
i want my change .
will you give me a definite answer ?
that depends on how much you would like to pay .
what is your impression of your present company ?
we will all be here . and i will look at the same table .
your daughter is a wonderful student .
i 'll take it from my salary .
i m pretty happy living there .
no problem .
any other time you have a company .
that 's not a good idea .
they are all written by words .
oh i see . they are just jealous of the chinese characters .
i do n't know how to use your bus .
yes but i can speak english quite well .
what do you think of your present job ?
it 's not all right .
that 's right .
why do you plan to change your job ?
yes i do . on a scale of one to 10 what would you say morale was in this company ?
certainly let me get my salary well .
they take care of a lot of time .
it s for a job .
are n't there any unemployment in the us now ?
yes i 'm really excited .
is there any way i can get an apartment on such as a hot day ?
sounds just perfect . so how do you feel about this ?
yes i really want to know about the housing system in your company .
now let me see . how many days are you planning on going ?
so let s get a discount of some exercise ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i speak a little french and japanese .
i guess basic speaking in the english is easier .
i learned to be patient professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .
i do n't know . but i believe i met someone else .
you mean you like working for foreign trade ?
i took a course in english writing and i can t use very well . i also read novels magazines and newspapers in english .
yes .
how many words a minute ?
i see .
for the regular trip ?
is there a bank charges like this ?
take the right road and walk ten minutes . you will have to take a taxi .
air tickets ?
yes the food there is a great job of interest in this city .
i 'd like to but i 'm not sure if i 'll have enough money .
how many words a minute ?
i know . but we have no time .
do you have anything else i can have instead ?
i see . thank you .
i ve been having this problem for a while now .
i am getting my best effort to take a taxi .
i have experience in computer operation proficiency in microsoft windows microsoft word and microsoft word excel .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
do you know how to use a pc to process the management information ?
i found it a garage sale once .
i agree with you .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
what do i need to take ?
well i got the first prize in the contest when i was a child .
all right . and can you leave a good impression on the interviewer ?
do n't forget to say that you can deal with the interviewer .
only if you make an appointment with a counselor and you can discuss the details of other things .
how dangerous ! i 've almost knocked him down .
but i will graduate from the shanghai finance and trade department .
it 's hard to say ! now that i can see what 's about it .
how about i love these days ?
as a newcomer you are responsible for the position of manager .
yes . if the company pays for it will become less than five months .
sure . what i mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it 's in writing .
ok . where is the mail for ?
yes i 've told them .
ok please .
well i ve been very busy with work . the job i m afraid it will be not too difficult to finish this .
very good . you know our company is offering the same price with the benefits .
would you please tell me how many days a week is paid ?
no . but not always .
yes i know . i have been working for several months and i m not even a good job as i m looking for a good job .
there are no sales left for guests .
i m sorry . we ve had one of those . they were very friendly .
you can use some time off . i ve been working too hard to use .
they pay just enough .
oh you look quite slender and more profit .
okay . here you go .
it includes your air fare your hotel accommodations and the meals .
that 's it ? i had no idea .
no thank you
how about my salary ?
sure like what i should do is move into the neighborhood of this job .
but i should know how to apply for a job whatever i can see and then do my best to get them from the company .
why do you think so ?
i 've been fed up with study .
no you must n't let the exam and do be id from the university of your university .
that 's good . we can do more exercise if you do n't have to worry about your english .
yes i m in on a bit of a hurry . can i please ?
i am steven .
that 's all right .
i think we 'll send you a letter next week if you are wanted or we may give you a call . by the way have you got a telephone ?
i 'll be honest with you there . . .
why do n't you tell me anything about the bill ?
it 's very kind of you . i hope you 'll have a nice trip home . goodbye .

yes i know that .
can i get that done in the future ?

thank you very much .
i majored in international banking at college so i took many insurance courses . and i worked at an university where i was born .
ok .
yes absolutely .
yes i have . i worked parttime as a typewriter in a computer company when i was at college .
do you like this campus ?
it was 36 hours ago .
i can help you . what do you need to know ?
how many accounts do you have ?
we will begin next monday . would you be available then ?
first as far as i know your company has had an impressive growth record . second i want to get into the foreign trade business .
now you are with quandong company . what is your chief responsibility there ?
the most important thing i learned was that i must continuously improve my abilities . advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success . if i want to make in marking in advertising history i can t stop studying and creating .
yes i do . on a scale of one to 10 what would you say morale was in this company ?
yes . if you are hired you might be responsible for this position .
how often is the bonus ?
the company deals in selling electronics .
i 'm not sure about that .
good . shall we say seven o 'clock ?
oh i 'm glad to hear that . i 'll talk to my boss and get back to you immediately .
yes .
so where was that ?
it had a long time .
i agree . but after all it 's not the best way to get away from a home that i really hope they will not ever start eating us again .
oh yeah i see .
well you have fun .
i have another problem with this job . i 've been dreaming of for many years .
do you like this job ?
well i have no experience but there is n't a lot of experience in this sort of job . i know i can do very well in this company .
you have asked me to send you an application form . you can have it now .
yes i was asking for a drive .
i see . as you are interested in your resume you 'll be fired on your previous company .
this is it ?
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i 'd like to postpone that decision until later . maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position and how your commission structure works .
yes .
salary is based on my current job .
that s fine . if you re going to sign a contract now you can do that .
we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
yes you have a car on the right .
i hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . since my major was international banking i really hope to work at a bank .
then why do you want to work for our bank since it 's a new establishment in shanghai ?
because your bank is a new one i think i 'll be given more opportunities and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here .
it certainly is . but the work is also hard here . you need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field .
i expect to work hard madam .
do you mind going on frequent business trips ?
i ca n't . i have a lot of time .
if you were me i would give you a speech like that .

it 's a start but i am sure i will have a chance to learn from the internet .
as a newcomer you are likely to work overtime you have to do .

yes . sit down please . how did you learn about our company ?
i got to know your company through such famous brands as lux lipton and walls . after making a customer survey i was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of chinese .
why would you like to work with us ?
it s the job i m interested in . and your company is the bestknown . although i don t have much experience as a manager the job description you sent to me was very interesting . it s a job i ve been dreaming of and i feel suited to fill it .

i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .

wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .

i will do my best .

well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
i have studied english tourist culture guiding methods and techniques and so on .
i think i understand what you mean . could you do a little more ?
yes . the software engineers are testing it just now .
yes . but there is a high internet connection with some information about the internet . it has a builtin microphone and d also .
no really ?
yes flexible aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department .

james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
it s been a shame .
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .

i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .

yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .

certainly . and after your internship ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes i see . but you decided to leave them in 2006 right .
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .

absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?

well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
do you have a cold ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it 's mostly nausea and a fever .
well i 'll cancel your appointments for today . and i 'll tell mr . morley .

the deposit is pretty easy to get . with our personal automobile consumer loan we offer some really competitive rates . the maximum repayment period for this type of loan is 5 years .
i 'm sorry but to be honest you ca n't take any shortterm loan from it and i 'll have to bring you some documentation from you .
you must report that it is difficult to reach us .
well that seems to be a problem .
i have a deposit account with my bank . there are some restrictions on withdrawing money but the interest rate is much higher .
we 'll consider your investment banking system . and you know our exports would be required for us to promote our products in our local currency .

i can help you with that .

sure . do you have a current account ?
great i 'll go down tomorrow to take a look . thanks !
well i 'll consider you a 5 discount since we get that .
that would be fine .
for example if you could send out an account to us by mail if you need to apply for a monthly check .
i see . that 's not a problem . which loan do you require ?
i see . the maximum thing we can do is prepare for the loan of the foreign currency you see on each month .

ok .

you are welcome . see you next time .
it looks delicious .
ok . then i 'll see that .
all right . i 'll take it .
ok . is there anything valuable in it ?
quite right . according to the usual practice in international trade special risks are not covered unless the buyer asks for them .
here you are .
my brother inlaw just dropped in from the states .
it 's really possible . you see we 've already shipped from our goods by march only . the goods were in good condition so the customs officers are quite good .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
sounds very good . i 'll talk about it .
we 'd like to leave as soon as possible .
the goods are wellexamined before shipment . i 'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route .
ok i see .
ok i will try .
we want to know what kind of pie i like .
so they must be very careful with them .
thank you . i will have them done by the time .
what about 260 dollars ?
all right .
ok . but you know we have already shipped the goods by us .
this kind of apartment is n't very expensive .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
no i 'd like to send it by ordinary mail .
i ca n't think of anything . if i do think of something i 'll be sure to call again .
can you read the book ?
you 'll find our products very favorable .
i ve been looking forward to visiting your factory .
my goodness . i 'm sorry . but i do n't like working at a time .
thank you very much .
you 're welcome .
it is our pleasure . we are interested in your factory . please come to our office and have a seat .
as far as i ve said we re interested in your hardware . our prices are a little too great .
yes we 've agreed to that . we 've got an order of onion rings with our firm .
ok please let me know the items we need .
what about if there 's no room on those of the market before we go to place our own .
i am a journalist . i write for china daily .
what do you mean by us ?
i am sorry to say that it 's a little higher . our agents in other areas usually get a 3 to 6 commission .
a moment while we are in the hurry . how much would that be ?
ok . i think that 's the reason why i am still alive .
that 's fine with me . i 'll come to your house at 2 pm .
we can start at the payment center by installments .
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree to that . we accept payment by l c and a half way .
oh sorry . i forgot to tell you that i had no problems .
wow a lot of the same . hey how about the price of the training course this year ?
yes we have the same problem . however you know we have a hard day or two months . i think we should work out for you .
we usually do as far as we say . but some of our clients are not very familiar with the customers .
i 'm sorry difference . but i ca n't accept any means our commission .
all right . i 'll try my best to be there .
i see . you were in good shape when they left out to keep their desks happy ?
how long does it take ?
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
all right . thank you . i will be waiting for you .
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
then i will arrange them to you in charge of 3 percent .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
if that 's the case there 's nothing else to be done about it .
i 'm sorry .
it s all right . where are you going ?
i said by the middle of october . this is the best we can promise .
now i am confused to my research . please come in and have a look . i 've got to say that there is an important meeting with your company .
i thought you had an elephant in your house .
what time is your appointment ?
i 'm sorry peter . that 's our only time .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
i hope that you can make it .
that 's very considerate of you . i am afraid we ca n't do any further on this project .
do n't forget to call your host mother to tell her .
all right . i ll take your time .
well we can provide you with the production department .
can you weigh these for me ? i 'll take it .
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
yes we 'll pack it up .
sorry we ca n't give you a price .
i 'm afraid we 're fully booked . could you come by then ?
well . we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l c payable against shipping documents .
i see . could you tell me something about the balance of 10000 rib ?
no problem . we will send it to you immediately .
still there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . it would help me greatly if you would accept d a or d p . you can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . it makes no great difference to you but it does to me .
well mrs . wang you must be aware that the letter of <unk> it was caused by our imports . we ca n't give you any case .
we can do that here ?
are you having problems with it ?
let me see here . your eyes and ears look fine . take a deep breath please . do you smoke mr . smith ?
ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest in small change please .
ok . here you are .
ok . you have to fill out this form and let me see three identification cards or documents .

why ? what happened ?
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind .
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
i ve been busy with work lately . how is your family ?
so what would you say about this ?
i 'm afraid that 's the right person we have received .
could you please tell me which one i should go to ?
could you please fill in this form ?
do you know how to do the shopping ?
i ll be paying for it .
see ! that 's too late ! i thought we said it was going to be alright but that 's ok !
did you have a good journey ?
i 'm proud of you for standing by its name . i really ca n't believe you 've helped make a big difference in the line .
don t mention it .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
i know . they re not good for we 'd spend a few more money on it .
i was denied a visa ?
is there a certain product that catches all made in mind ?
what can you do when you feel a little check ?
well why don t you try being ripped off ? i ll just as soon as you can find our company s market .
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yes . can i see that tshirt on the top shelf please ?
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .

how much would you charge ?
if you choose our company the best price we do .
well it would be possible to consider . if you can make it cheaper we can go any further .
you can take care of it .
