what do you mostly do during your workout ?
i 've always given priority to work with established clients because they are very busy .
in that case you want to work with less weight . you can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . five kilo weights should be enough . now it s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .
about three times a week if i can .

i would like to speak to another question .
well that 's true but we 'd have to work on this .
turn right at the third intersection .
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
at least we 've got plenty of time .
please .
i hope we have a good time .
hi .
were you looking at the polling place ?
how about some fish ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .

you re right . i ll have to find a new apartment as soon as possible .
ok . i 'll be right back .
i 'm sorry but i do n't have any cash . i 'm afraid it wo n't be helped you .
thank you very much .
yes there is one downstairs in the hotel .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i need to meet you mrs . smith .
probably not .
where is the fitting room ?
it 's two yuan .
can i pay by card ?
ok . the price is reasonable because it was their lowest price by 2 dollars per month .
at least we 've got plenty of time .
please .
that 's just a few minutes walk to the office come around and see me now .
thanks .
i think a cab is better .
oh excellent . how much does it cost ?
you 're welcome .
sorry . i 'm afraid that i can t . the fitting room is in the back .
i like miniskirt .
well . cantonese food is rather light beijing food is heavy and sichuan food is usually hot and spicy .
i like it very much . can you make it a little cheaper ?
i want this one . i want a the best one .
i think that s a good idea . what kind of shoes do you want ?
may it be used as a sofa in the day and a bed during the night ?
yes . i think you 'll find our price very favorable .

you have good taste .

not bad . actually i like it . it 's very pretty .
oh in that case sure . what kind of dress do you want ?
i 'm not very particular about the design . but i think we should have a different dress .
yes . i think we have a very formal dance .

sure . are you wearing any makeup ?
how did the business trip go ?
got it . any time to talk ?
we have a lot of things on the computer .

how much would it cost ?
i understand . but you know i ca n't let me show you the truth .

what happened ?
a moment please . here you are .
i would like to buy two exquisite watches for me and my girlfriend .
well first of all what size do you want ?
no i do n't think the pair fits me well . do you have a bigger one ?
you just missed a convenience store .
i don t know .
yes .
you mean this is a good idea ?
not bad . but they were married for three days .
oh yeah ?
ok let 's go .
then what 's the difference between the two ?
i thought it was a little table for some music . . . oh no !
you want to bet ?

alright this is a good one . how would you like to make your friends ?
about three times a week .
what 's your sport ?
i really appreciate that .
that sounds like a good idea .
it 's very dull and they are n't very good at all .
well that 's true . i 've decided to give you a call from the police station .
i apologize for the inconvenience .
your car is really tough . what do you think ?
but we still need to contact the owners right now .
it 's too bad to be there . what 's more i 'm going to leave .

what time do you think you can come back in two days ?
okay i 'll take care of it .
i appreciate your understanding .
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
well i have to get to work overtime .
not really .
i know . i always get too nervous when i am busy .
of course . go straight ahead till you come to the traffic lights turn left at the third intersection and turn right .
i 'm sorry .
it 's only a few minutes walk .
how far is it ?
you 're welcome .
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
that d be great but could i have a cup of tea first ?
sure i ll just go put the kettle on . why don t you have a seat on the sofa and i ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .
i see . well i can help with the chores while i m here . you two could probably use my help .
that s very nice of you to offer . here s your tea . be careful it s still quite hot .
it 's just around the corner .
how long do i have to stay there ?
yes it 's easy . if you want to go to work you can make it .
how long ago ?

thank you very much .
you 're welcome .
sorry but i m not really interested in those things .
well they are very nice you know .
really ?
yes .
oh i do n't care about that .
everybody is buying them .
are they ?
yes they re very fashionable you see .
i am afraid i am not interested in fashion .
yes the sunset hotel is three blocks away . maybe you can ask them .
great . but can i have a look at it ?
walk down till you see the first lights . it 's cross the street .
sure . take the tennis racket . now throw the ball up and hit it with the racket . like this .
oh well . i 'll have to live with it . what else can i do ?
yes it is .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that might be going overboard a bit . how about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . ok i 'll take it .
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing .
that s even better than the real thing .
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than 100 you get a 50 voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
sure . the fitting room is right over there .
yes . i want to make a plane reservation to shanghai china .
this is kevin .
no . i 'm not a religious person .
i could help you with that .
would you like to go now or later ?
that 's where she is .
oh yes . i took her a shine to get them for the first time .
oh ! i forgot about those too !
can you tell me more ?
yes .
shall we go out for a swim station and buy a lot of water ?
please accept it .
why do you think that ? it s delicious too .
ok ! here you are .
is it close to eat ?
which restaurant ?
well . i 've been very busy lately . can you tell me something about this ?
how about this one ?
no thanks . that will be all .
how would you like the steak ?
one coke and the other a sprite please .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
845 lincoln avenue .

i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted

no it is not easy .
i like my hair cut .
what do you want ?
yes not really .
i 'd like to discuss the new order with you . would you like to have lunch together at garden hotel next tuesday ?
i recommend the roast pork chops .
well i do n't like indian food very much . i am sure you 'll enjoy it .
how about at 1100 ?
i can try it on .
what else can i get for you ?
yes i buy a computer and i can find it now .
right . but i do n't think there are any interesting newspaper coming by the company . i can make a lot of money before we get into the office .
what is your major ?
that 's something that you really need to work on .
well it 's definitely the last straw that comes from the stock market .
i m not really sure . it s a great opportunity to learn a lot from my mother .
not really . the price has been reduced by 50 .
i want to try on this pair .
the round shape pair ?
what sports do you like best ?
just a moment please .
i agree how much ?
you just make a right .
can i get a soda please ?
so how about an aperitif ?
it sounds good . i 'd like to start with a compare .
stirred or shaken ?
stirred will be fine .
here you are .
thank you .
sure . all of our mixed drinks are excellent . you can also try a delicious nonalcoholic cocktail .
can you recommend one ?
try a singer . it has lime juice and grenadine over ice .
it sounds interesting . i 'll take one .
here we go .
it tastes great .
enjoy yourself .
yeah .
no problem . i think i 'll just have a bite .
i want it to be the best . i do n't mind having enough .
i fell on the way to school and your bike got scratched . i 'm really sorry .
i think i 'll have a try .
do you prefer coffee or tea with cream ?
are you kidding ?
no thank you . i 'd like them with yogurt . it 's very delicious .
yes . that s why i never bought a house .
how 's so much money you 're trying to quit ?
oh . i 'm going to the disco with my friends .
let me have the babyback ribs .
let 's have that .
of course . the sliced noodles they are <unk> cucumbers . they are kept in the kitchen .
blah . . . what 's that ?
no problem . i ll go right now .
what do you mean by that ?
you 're welcome .
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
do you know what to get ?
that does look very nice .
i 'm not sure . there 's just one thing though i 'd like to eat .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
um this steak i asked for to be medium rare .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
she must be really painful .
is she strict ?
what did you do ?
that 's all right . have you got all of your information ?
one moment . do you want to withdraw some cash while you 're at it ?
i have read anything about them ?
when do you expect to come ?
why do n't you do that ?
are you scared of anything ?
would you like me to have the delivered up ?
really ? how are you doing ?
i called you yesterday . did you get my message ?
so then why do n't you drive it ?
is there anything else you would like ?
i don t want to go to the supermarket .
what a shame ! i do n't know how old he is .
well you know how i 've been working at the economist as a proofreader right ?
you 're right . we 'll be in a good mood after this .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
really ? why ?
about 3 minutes .
but i want to go to the front desk and i want to change the room for tonight .
yes .
no . not at all .
i see . what do you mean ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
oh . i see .
there 's quite a long list actually ! you can use if for business trip expenses medical expenses any internal payments .
that sounds like a good idea . it s always a simple thing to do .
would you like to have a look at the kitchen ? it is especially quiet and clean .
that 's good to hear . she has a rather than cope with her .
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's about a tenminute walk .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
all right .

you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
is that you like it ?

can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
we need help just change our clothes .
mangoes ? what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
can you eat the seed ?
no . peel the skin with a sharp knife and throw out the seed .

nobody told you what happened ?

i think that i should go and get some exercise . i really do n't want to get to know the hospital .
i think that 's a bunch of nonsense . it seemed ok to me .
let s go shopping for a spin . you can try it out .
true .
are you a hurry ?
oh come on ! what was the problem ?

that s great ! i love it .

hello madam . where to ?
could you please tell me where it is ?
ok . thank you .
but you 'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight wo n't you ?
3 yuan .
here is 50 yuan .
it is at the north of forbidden city on the central axis of beijing .
you 'll soon go to sleep ?
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
why are you interested in leaving ?
thank you very much .
hi my sweetheart . it s dad .
sure . take a seat .
thank you . where should i send your final phone bill ?
i 'm not sure i 've been feeling pretty good .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
okay but the only thing i need is to do is work out .
see you then .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
good morning john !
wow what a pity ! i hope you can t get in shape .
it was almost the first time i went to my boss last week .
i am very tired .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
well then what are you doing ?
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
ok ! but if you don t mind i ll take you to the elevator .
thank you very much .
do n't you hit it off ?
it has been two years now .
i see .
she 's pretty outgoing i think . but i 've never met before .
what is her strongest trait ?
yeah most of the time i think it 's still a good place to watch .
why ? what would you do when we were little ?
what happened ?
thank you but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
but i 'm going to have it at 9 30 . i 'm on saturday mornings .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
i can take the car myself . you should drive a car instead of driving your car .
what do i do now ?
yeah ! i made a reservation . . . do you think we can make it ?
what should i do then ?
do you think we can take a lot of money ?
i guess you 're right . i just bought it last week .
we 'll go out and watch the football match .
i think you have to worry about that ! we are not going to run a red light and on our way out of the car .
i m looking for a sweater .
have you brought your camera ?
i d like to have an indication of price . how much is it ?
have you brought your camera ?
no problem . the magazine has a very good reputation in the united states . it also has a more flexible effect .
sure i do . what do you want ?
thank you .
so why do you buy stamps here ?
thanks a lot for the warning .
i m sorry but how can you get it done ?
is it in light ? wow this is a young one .
that s ok i can do that .
and how much is it ?
i 'm not sure . but i like this one .
well you can still drive without problems .
that s right .
thanks for saying so .
no problem !
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
is this salami and bologna you have here ?
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll speak to bob he 'll be able to help us .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
we want to look at some of your products .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes . i 'm just here about an hour ago .
no way ! i m gonna catch up with this pipe !
great . this is my first time to come in .
well . . . actually i am sure it will have a great time . you know each other has a large range of beautiful electric appliances .
so it s done mr . emory .
it would be better if you give me a more reduction .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
what size are you ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's a gym nearby . perhaps you should go out dancing or watch a movie .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
and it 's new and well equipped with young actors and well spent most of the year .
it s a great idea to have a good balcony .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
i think i might like a bottle of champagne .
i have n't thought of that .
yes it has two bedrooms . that 's convenient .
can we have the bill now ?
the ad says 325 plus deposit .
that s way too much .
what are you going to do ?
i really do n't know how to play it .
let me see . that 's no <unk> dollars .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you please reconsider ?
i go to panda express for my chinese food .
i m afraid not .
yes . i like cooking very much . i got this hobby when i was 12 years sold .
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah . i like the bamboo design and its content . the certainly has a history of foreign food is a major source of its strength .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
all right . now do you want your measurements ?
i 'll take one on the second floor .
i am afraid there s nothing i can do about the brown one .
i need to think about the price . how much do you want to pay ?
it s my mother . i hope you ll like them .
well i m really tired from packing . i ve been looking forward to seeing you .
don t worry . we ll get one too . they re very expensive .
i 'll have them on the rocks . how much do they have ?
the ship is right over there .
what s the difference ?
even if you like to go to the library you can use your key to get on the web for free .
i m sure you ll enjoy the trip .
this is he . how can i help you ?
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
yes i see . there are two bedrooms a kitchen and a bathroom .
i am going to have a home with two bedroom and a kitchen .
i will be glad to have apartments with you .
that sounds good . see you then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
how about you ? there 's a subway stop just around the corner .
yes . we 're going to have to get one .
ok . here is the money .
no but if you need to check your driver 's license just let me know .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
but the price has been reduced by 50 .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it has great curb appeal .
the view from the window is wonderful .
i know .
with so few windows how can you even see what the problems are ?
that 's such a nice house .
i really like it . i think i ve got an important meeting with some friends .
the best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom .
you bet it !
five . besides live alone and one kid .
it is ! look at the market ! it is now !
let s rock and roll band 6 .
what is it ?
how can i know what it is ?
well i can help you pack . my coat is also a perfect fit for you .
great ! i like the garden especially the house .
i thought it might rain today .
thanks a lot .
something like that .
i 'm sorry . he 's out at the moment . can i help you ?
hello i am calling to see if you are free . may i help you ?
oh ? where did you buy it ?
i would love to look at a onebedroom apartment .
let 's see .
i have no problem with 6 p . m .
we have only 1000 yuan in 6 months .
i 'll see you then .
we have a deal with the kitchen and floor .
please make sure to use the machine . and fill out the form .
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
yes . i want to make a plane reservation to shanghai china .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
okay thanks .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
oh i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
do you know how short you want your hair to be ?
yes my name is ms jane reeve reeve .
i 'm just going to get my book .
no . that s just my hair cut .
oh it 's long enough . how about your hair ?
no problem . i think it 's just a little tight in the back .
certainly a shame .
i hope so . i 'm not sure about this style will work for me .
as a matter of fact i 'm here to ask you some questions .
no you can t go back to a little while . we 'll give you an injection of wine and you will be able to find your nowhere .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yes i do . the one i have to wear is very beautiful .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yeah . i remember that it is red here . we also need a new hard dessert that goes to make the skin soft and style .
i know . and probably a little too wild .
i like my tip but it 's only a few seconds away .
it 's all right . we need some things just in the box .
thanks . that 's very nice of you .
yes . we have an excellent service here .
ok . i 'll take one .
all right . i 'm almost finished .
let 's see .
oh yes . i know what you mean .
so what ? are you serious ?
i ll go and check with the kitchen .
i like the new apartment . i can go check out the kitchen next .
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
ok let s go and check the kitchen first .
yes we do . we usually do have a big problems if you like .
yes . i do n't have to worry about them . i do n't know how to use them .
ok i will .
how long would you like to purchase the house ?
great . i can look at it for a wonderful living room .
is that very expensive ?
where is it ?
why did n't you find a porter ? it 's selling all day .
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
let s go check out the kitchen next .
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
actually it 's the most important thing to us . if you like the way i 'll try to find a place that is made in white house .
ok . i will go write you a list of what we need is just use .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !

well it looks very nice .
i like peppermint chocolates .
certainly sir . for your most of our customers you can get it ! maybe i can help you with some details .

fine . i 'd like to try some chinese food .
hmm . . . you 're really delicious . i think there are a lot of fat restaurants in it .
many times . we can offer you on the top floor . but why do n't you want to work for a newly <unk> kitchen cleaning and then we can go to the beach anytime you like .
that would be wonderful . thanks . i 'll make sure everything goes well with the skirt .
where are the new clothes ?
i see . but what about the vacation policy ?
i m afraid you have to do that .
ok . thank you . and what is your name ?
you 're welcome .
no . it 's a gift .
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
the price tag is ok .
you know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . the prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where .
when do you catch it love ?
they are attending an international conference here .
was there a discount taken after 10 ?
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
but i want to get a pair of shoes that i know more about on the prices .
that s a good idea . i can go there with my friends .
it 's an open book .
you missed a court appearance .
yes . i am looking for the list of apartment . what should i do ?
yes . but i would like to go to the palace first .
do you mind if i bought a credit card for you ?
you 'll have to pay 25 every time you overdraft .
how about the olympic games ?
i hope you can find a new job in the street .
yes i would like to check in .
sure . do you have your receipt ?
i lost it .
you have made a good choice . coming to china and take a look at the production line .
i 've sent my return address for about two weeks .
go and try it on .
have you got the ticket ?
i 'd like to cash back .
are you kidding ?
my brother and i would like to have thought of going to get some other things .

sure what do you want to know ?
i am disappointed with your work lately .
do i get any order of that restaurant ?
is that could you speak any spanish ?
anything else ?
have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?
i guess so . as long as the host family is high they get no one would get rid of them .
yeah i know . i also heard that it was a local food in the country .

my pleasure ! this tea towel s a little ragged . do you have another one ?
how about the umbrella ? it 's very different from the street .
you 're right . i feel sleepy .
i never thought about that . i thought they had enough of their parttime job .
no i did n't . i 'm a hurry . we need their money .
yes i like it very much .
that 's great ! i m completely happy with it !
not really i try to cook a lot of delicious dishes .
yeah i ll start running a lot of weight and having a cup of coffee . i ll start with some basic meals and then watch tv .

i 'm not sure . they just renovated a month .
no nothing else .
all right .
thank you . what is the latest fashion ?
sure . we also have a careful diet coke with alcohol .
it 's still stocked and there 's plenty of ice . how about this ?
you can buy some ice cream and sugar .
but coffee is more expensive .
ok . what is it ?
wow you 're right . i 'll try a little of .
you 've got a deal .
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not . do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
yes . i have to go to the movies .

coffee only black coffee
all right .
i want some sort of candy .
what kind of soda would you like ?

i think so .
did you see the damage ?
that 's true and we have been on this bus for a while .

it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials ignite it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .
yes . i 've seen some photos of the city in china .
are you kidding ? well i 've never heard of this before . it 's just what i need to do .
here we have a bus tour .
not good . i lost my wallet .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .

i got on about fifteen minutes ago .
o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room sir ?
not much .
you have your own vehicle ?
i do n't need a car . i walk to work .
do you usually travel by bus ?
it 's too expensive for me .
thank you . do you think we should do something else ?
i do n't know .
can you see that ?
it is very crowded .
i wish you luck .
sure . here we are .
one of your brake lights is out .
i got a ticket for a while but i got a really bad one .
i ca n't believe it .
i 'm telling you the truth .
i am so sorry to hear that . what shall i do ?
i hate the bus system in london !
hi .
oh i have n't decided yet . what about you ?
really ? that 's great !
i think so . i 'd like to buy some animals for my son .
this is the kitchen . every thing 's new .
i won 200 to spend on any books of my choice .
you like panda express ?
i think that i might have .
not at all . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i did n't want to be late . but i think it was a little more practical .
i also need to prepare a gift for the supper .
what a good idea !
i 'm very grateful . what can i do ?
i 'm working on marketing . and you ?
if there 's nothing i can do about that . maybe i will go to my department .
oh no . i am a little worried about my family . you know i ve been working at a bar and i need to go to the beach in the afternoon .
what happened ?
this is a good thing . what 's wrong with you ?
ok i will try my best to hear from you .
but i still have a feeling that he is allowed to learn english .
i know but you 're going to have to give me a raise .
this is all right .
i can do that .
at first it is important to make a living room <unk> .
what 's your favorite dance ?
what 's that ?
what can i do for you ?
i 've been feeling pretty well .
i am sorry for that . we will have to discuss this matter later .
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
i think you re absolutely right ! actually we have to wait for a long time !
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
i thought that he was an accident .
i think i want to try a new style .
but he will always be my best man .
i have been studying . i 'm taking exams . my major is english .
i know how you feel . i am sure you can do well .
no i have n't . i 'm going to travel very light this time .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
next week .
no i 'm a tourist .
what 's your favorite dance ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
i do n't need a car . i walk to work .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
well there s nothing else i can do about it .
what 's the matter
the food station was as crowded as usual . i waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich and when i finally got it the chicken was underdone .
well you can simply tell me how i am about it .
i bought this circulator here yesterday but it does n't work .
well you know me . i 've been cooking chinese food quite a lot .
can i do n't know . let 's go !
fine . how are you doing this morning ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
well i 'm an english major you know . i 'm an excellent student . i 've always enjoyed studying .
i 'm an <unk> .
i see . what do you think of the apartment ?
i 'll do my best .
would you like cash back ?
what ? you mean i 'm tired of all day long ?
well you know how i 've been working at the economist as a proofreader right ?
i do n't know anything about this .
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
i have the confidence in the college and i 'm very happy to help my skills .
of course not . but if you want to learn english conversation you 'll have to take an additional course in some english schools .
hey i just ca n't believe it !
that 's ok .
i am worried about the meeting this morning .
do you have to go to the university of ohio or free ones ?
i have no idea .
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
then i need a money order for 250 dollars .
generally speaking he 's a general design and a law firm who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network <unk> or search engines but from our circular insert . that means our customer base the net users are purposefully and actively seeking information about the web format . based on these findings i am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future !
i like the way the price of gasoline is still too big for about the old workers .
we can take some time off at the hotel . see you tomorrow evening .
you ve been working so hard .
exactly .
that is great . a lot of people are afraid to live in the right direction . but that would be very convenient .
do you think it 's a good idea to have a language opportunities ?
i 'll plan for going back to china after the vacation .
you re going to take courses ?
yes i m going to take some university courses there .
what are you going to major in ?
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
okay . i 'll see you at six . is that your new bicycle ?
i 'm just doing a lot of work yes . i 'll get along with my friends and i 'll have a lot of fun too .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
of course . it 's on the third floor .
ok . i see . thank you very much for your time .
you can check out two books at a time .
my grandfather did that .
for two weeks . after that you must renew the book if you wish to keep them longer .
i see . thank you very much for your trouble .

you 're welcome .
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
my name is sam . how are your lessons going ?
nice to meet you too .
yes it 's pretty . we 're going to see the conference . i 'm going to take a conference .
can i help you ?
maybe i should invite you for the next dance .
this one is two . it might be a good idea to see the old film but i hate to play the piano for a week .
i 'm afraid i 've only got one myself left in a bit of school . they 'd look very different .
i think you 'll like it .
i 'm going to visit the family .
how many kids did that . he lives in your house in the same country ?
will you be able to make it ?
really ? how did your friends go ?
i really appreciate it . i 've heard that your company is very important . i would like to go there and have a good one .
do n't mention it . it 's been a pleasure talking to you .
i was n't able to attend the class this week so i decided to attend my class .
yes i 'm going to the states .
i 'm going to take a driver 's course .
good luck !
it 's right .
you 're under arrest for concealing illegal drugs .
i 'm going to take a driver 's course .
all right madam . can you tell me your name please ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't agree with that .
yes i was wondering if you could ask me to go dutch in the neighborhood .
so what did you do ?
i think so . he loves the girl very much .
you think he 's a good husband to work in the company .
i was wondering what kind of questions you have in mind .
also mr . bradley your room is in the breakfast room ready . i will take you there .
i took a parttime job last semester in translating and doing reception work for an exhibition . my work included hosting the visiting foreign exhibitors communicating with them arranging their agenda and translating several materials . i took any form of english test results after graduation .
well it 's really going to be a great opportunity .
yeah that 's true . i do n't know where to work .
then what 's your favorite kind of drink ?
of course not . after all i got home from an ambulance .
is n't it a bit expensive ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
did you go on a date already ?
yeah he s been like this for two weeks .
i hope you do n't think that excuse lets you off the hook .
i do n't know how to go on the bus every day .

not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
what do you need ?
you mean that we could be together ?
no it is not . there are two small foot in it .
i can come down and fix that for you if you 'd like .

i will go to the movies s degree .
i understand . you re more than happy with your friend .
what makes you consider your strengths ?
i remember a case that was filled with obstacles . the first thing that we did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . i was able to overcome my experience and was able to overcome most people . i was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . i took the experience while i happened to another job and i was able to overcome most people were outstanding .
what ? what do you mean ?
i agree . i think we should change the position .
what ?
that s okay . i understand . by the way is this the really expensive ?
i think you re right . maybe i just try to try one of the other people who speak english .

i would like to get a package of cigarette .
what can i help you ?

do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
are you serious ?
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
did you go to the top ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to buy two exquisite watches for me and my girlfriend .

do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great ! i think we could ask if there is any opportunity that might be true . that is excellent exercise too .
good . let 's go now .
and about time too .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .

i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .

it was my first time to relax .

i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
i want to have a different color carpet . i was very embarrassed .
i was just thinking about getting a bite to eat .
so what are you going to do ?
and the took this medicine before . and the doctor examines the rest of the milk .
it 's true .
why do n't you wear purple eye shadow for a change ?
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
thanks .
really ? what will i do if i m not even gonna catch up ?
excuse me miss . what 's the tour time we have ?
that s too bad . how long will it take ?
thank you mr . <unk> .
i 'll teach you how to get to sleep .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
eh so so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
how was the weather ?
huh ?
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i m just looking at this map of the world . i m preparing for a geography class .
how is it ?
thanks i 'm satisfactory mom .
well do you have a bigger one ?
anyway i think i need a nose job and some breast implants as well .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on mom . i 'm your a ! wait till the guys hear about this !
no you are right .
like you said you really believe but what if i really think of all the things that you think will make me happy ?
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'm going to bill 's house .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
the water will not drain .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know that . i 've brought some photos of the day . they say i know a lot about this . thank you .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
i think you re right . i really need to get more people from the movies .
i have already known that . i did n't get the scholarship right ?
well you know how i 've been working at the economist as a proofreader right ?
i love him .
i could n't agree with you more . where did you win ?
how much do you need to pay ?
i think i 'm lucky .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
thanks for coming .
when are you off ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
i 'm afraid you 're going to have to wait for the next bus .
goodbye . thanks again for everything .
i was wondering if you wanted to go for a walk with us .
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
gotta go . call me tonight .
okay . check you later .
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
you gotta have some better deodorant .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?

well you can bet this relationship is going to be a flash in the pan .
it 's amazing . i never knew it .
i think you must have been completely careful . actually my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . they had to give us a chance to think that they 'd be married .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?

i do n't have health insurance .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it 's just one of those things .

i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .

not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
i do n't like drinking milk .

couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
here it is .
yes .

and in the winter ?
you want to look at these historical relics here to see if you want .
yes we did . it was a very fantastic city .
i ca n't help it .
i do n't know . where did you get your idea ?
ok .
ms . stevens will be with you too .
he 's got a promotion .
well when did you find out ?
it 's true . he is a hard worker .
well this pair is nice but they re not very practical .
why not you wear formal clothes this year ?
the ones here are the ones that make up their mind .
i do n't know . maybe that 's why i can think about this for a while .
sure .
many people who live together and their friends .
oh my god . i 'm sorry .
no i did n't .
i already voted .
my absolute favorite is ice hockey .
why ?
sounds interesting .
do you like watching football matches ?
that is the best way to go .
yes it is the latest design for our models .
i really recommend you go to the gym every day and take care of things .
my new boyfriend is a far from work .
i wo n't do it .
quite well . i took a lot of care of the bag in the beginning . i was glad to do it .
that s right . the <unk> guy who keeps the 1500 meters . it s a total mystery to me .
not only is it affordable but it comes with all the appliances .
how often do i have to pay ?
yes .
well i guess i 'm a little shy .
i 'm telling you the truth .
ok . that 's fine .
i do n't know what i should do . i ve always had a few problems .
fine . let 's see the officer that pulled some money to walk around and his house .
we had a dog on the road and we said it was an excellent thing for us to get our seats for the whole and we had a wedding reception there .
the company has a very strict reputation for the company .
hey richard ! you are the right person for the job . that 's not fair .
yeah . i guess i 'll be more careful .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
it 's right . i often knew english is very good .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
i went to a boxing match in english class last night .
would you like to have one of the best ?
you can take a picture of the book .
there 's a picture of the pentagon in the united states . it was built with so many birds .
i 'm not sure . i just bought it a few days ago .
well i think i might have some more of the rides .
well take it easy . there are still a lot of other options . that 's why i 'm interested .
i have a terrific working relationship . i was the first time i do .
what was he like ?
i agree . he is also an excellent speaker .
he 's still injured . he kept trying to get out of the office work .
that 's just what i want to say . i 'll come back as soon as possible .

yes . they have been completely different now .
merry christmas jina .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
ah yes .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
it 's gone with the wind .
what kinds of books do you like to read ?
first the new product is to go up a little this year . it 's not much cheaper for you .
i see . that 's why i did n't realize that .
i feel like a little stupid .
what happens if the limits ?
we also need to provide you with water supplies . the also includes a shower and the shower but the temperature is 90 dollars per night .
i m reading about it dad .
really ? i want to go too .
i think so . i 'm not sure that there are enough room as well .
it s a very good game .
no i am not sure .
that sounds like a really good idea .
that 's a good question . i guess i will do that .
i do n't think so . the climbing must be bunch of strangers .
ok . i would n't mind the cold weather in this city .
yes it is . the oil painting ate half the mountain . it says that it is not broken or slippery .
no . but he 's really depressed .
well why not dine out together and go to the next block ?
that 's not true .
that 's right . he is a hard worker . everyone seems to have no interest in that .
yeah some people are pretty lucky to play in the same game . i really do n't know how to play well with them .
yes but i still love all the same clothes ! and i love going to be ripped off by this time !
yes some people have realized that people used to do get married on the internet . at the same time he was as careless as he was reluctant to answer the phone with the mobile phone .

the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i loved it very much . the score was very good .
anything else ?
i have not even told my boss that it would be his fault !
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
he 's diving for the gold .
not bad . i just got back from hawaii .

i think that we have .
not bad . i 'm so sorry .

yeah . he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .

well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .

no he was n't . but he got the message and never said anything .
you live in taiwan !
it does n't matter . my husband is away and i have a lot of things to do .
you mean he had a big boyfriend ?
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
did he leave when you left ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
it 's not really .
he tried to leave with the money .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
how did he make a fortune ?
yes . there is a little earlier than this is not a big deal .
sure . i 'll try to !
great !
he is a very famous teacher .
i think so . and it 's very convenient .
that 's fine . i 'll be finished in the mail . oh yes !

sure . it 's quite the one you have to prepare for .
how interesting people are there in the same world ?
and it 's common in chinese food .
and how about the special effects ?
it 's a hard question . i think they must have taken before the result .
wow ! it 's great ! what will it do if we 're going to work ?
as long as i do n't go to work . let s do that out .
why not ?
because i love the snow .
that 's ok . i 'll take the train .

i am glad to meet you . our waitress is over here . can i try them on ?

what a great idea !
the ancient olympics originated in ancient greece .
and what about the matches the christmas day ?
do you still remember that we already have a new year celebration on january 1st ?
do you recommend any other people who are interested in the same places ?
she is an accountant .
look at the museum guide . it 's worth visiting .
really ?
it 's well too large . it is seems there anything wrong with my credit rating and your credit rating and your credit rating and your salary .
i think mary is going to be covered by his work .
what we see ! do you have strong feelings for the picnic ?
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . . .

well . how much does the cost ?
10 dollars .
how about the balcony ?
no i want to pay all of it off today .
we already do that but it will cost you extra .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
oh i see .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
i 'm not sure if that 's a big mistake .
what are you going to do now ?
how much do you have ?
it s too bad that i could n't make it . who won ?
what do you mean ?
your room is ready . we ll pick you up at 6 p . m .
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
i m glad i m getting better .
of course i have . i 'm glad to help .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
you 're welcome . i wish i had something to drink but i learned a lot .
no i think that it might work for you .
wow you 're really working out there .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .
well then maybe you should call your secretary and tell him to reschedule the meeting .
well i do n't have any nightmares tonight . i 'm sure you 'll be my guide .
i think they were too violent for them .
yes . i 'm sorry . i do n't think that 's possible .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
why didn t you phone me from a callboy ?
i went there too .
really ? how did you know ?
yeah . i signed up for it online .
what did you learn from your job ?
forget it . we seemingly need to gather money little by little .
it s my pleasure .
okay . and do you want a large amount of cash with a b
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
no . it 's all yours .
then what 's your question ?
i think we 're quite right .
nice to meet you too .
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i 'm not really into the mood . i 'd like to have a try .
because i am no hat .
yeah a dancing queen . wanna go and join them ?
that 's all right . i know a lot about him that may have a try .
sounds just sense .
yes . no doubt about that . the chinese new year has been sung by the twice a long time .
is that the place you recommend ?
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west the purpose is generally quite <unk> savor the wine .
great so are you doing anything else ?
he was wearing the right person in the room .
i see . this is one of the top designs of these speak well for human consumption . i have to wear that is n't an thing right ?
it 's very confusing .
absolutely i love temple fairs . beijing has several temple fairs recently . they are different from each other to some extent but also have a lot in common .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . they think that is must be poor quality if it s that cheap .
hmm . . . i like barbie dolls .
ok . i 'll meet you at the club at two thirty .
i 'll be glad to hear that .
my pleasure . i 'll sing it together .
not really but i like it very much .
thanks a lot . i appreciate the compliment .
no thanks . i 'd like to have tea .
i am a beginner . let 's go to a disco after dinner .
ok it 's on me .
let me have a look . it 's not too late . you are allowed to have a taste .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
oh it is not easy to learn !
yes i was . but i 'm not very much of it .
i guess i 'm glad exams are over .
i think that they are dull and they 're so thin .
i didn t get accepted .
that 's not true .
no . i 'd like to go alone .
that 's right . we just hope each other day we can learn from now on .
what a coffee bar ?
sounds like a good idea .
that 's right . thanks .
it 's very nice .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
swimming . what about you ?
then what are the temperatures in your life ?
no but i have a doubt its name is 5 .
i suppose i do n't want to waste a lot of time in this city that 's just how old i 'd have to pay for my own use .
i think the can handle this .
but what kind of power struggles are you talking about ?
it 's already cold .
what do you mean ?
that s a good idea
the sea seems quite calm so there will be no fear of seasickness . are you seasick ?
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring best . it is neither too cold nor too hot . freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . how about you ?
may i ask you some questions ?
i really don t know the feeling . there is too much water in this city . but it looks like the nice spring day .
well it 's nice to see you again . i 'd like to go hiking because it 's usually quite cold in winter .
yes especially in spring .
it 's always nice to have you here . i like rainy days .
i like winter too but sometimes it gets too cold .
i like spring because it gets cold and mild in autumn . i usually go to bed in august and fall . autumn is the best season for winter .
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
the weatherman says it 's going to snow tomorrow .
is it very cold in the winter ?
one moment please .
yes that 's true .
no i 'm a britisher . where do you want to come ?
you mean that i 'm a little bit conservative ?
oh i 'm sorry . but it 's been a lot of miles .
it 's very kind of you . i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
not at all .
what 's the problem ?
i 'm glad you enjoyed it .
how do you miss it ?
sure what is it ?
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
i start next week .
all right . thank you very much .
i 'll be there .
yes . i am free tomorrow .
what happened ? we just got the wrong bus .
i 'd love to .
go to bed right now .
really ? i did n't have time to go there .
this morning . i mean . . .
ok we can book you a private room for up to ten people at that time . could you give me your name please ?
thank you for your understanding . i will book you a call .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green <unk> . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
it 's not the right material . or the right color . i ca n't possibly accept it .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
that s all . how much altogether ?
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
let me see . you have bought it for me when you can get it fixed .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
i am really excited for you .
do n't mention it . you can trust me .
what do you want to wait for ?
nothing . i am just pissed that i have an allergy and <unk> for my children .
so when did he begin to learn that ?
yes he does .
me too . i think he s really a shoulder to cry on .
i 'm waiting for my date .
you are really a good citizen .
then do you think i should work out time ?
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i can t . i ve had a date already .
did n't i tell you ? we could have been to that party but we could have more interesting conversation and more about the way .
this friday evening ?
i 'll take you there in about one minute .
i am sorry .
they are filed alphabetically .
i would n't be happy about that .
no they have two older brothers and one younger sister .
not too bad .
it 's my pleasure . what can i do for you today ?
hi basil .
goodbye .
well i think we should go now . it 's getting pretty late .
i hope you have a nice day .
if she wants to study film probably would have a chance to study engineering .
but i . . .
i do n't think so .
perhaps you can give her some advice .
what were you thinking of getting ?
i 'd love to but i am very sure i ca n't stand the music . i 've been standing there in a few months .
oh i see . thank you for calling .
i know that . i need to get this done as soon as i can remember on the internet .
well it s ok . good luck to you !
i think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than atm processing speed .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . but i do n't believe that you 're sure to win . for the environment there is much pollution than by sea .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and i m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn t truly worthy .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i do n't believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . it s a very exciting game .
you should be kidding .
yes well we have a lot of experience in this area .
they look very uncomfortable .
then i take the same racket as a <unk> . how can i get that done ?
keep your chin up . now let 's go to that milk shop .
yes i do .
you just need to get a car fixed asset .
very good . ok . so you just have to wear <unk> .
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
these are good . they look nice .
i only hope you will enjoy the clothes .
but i am not hungry because i know a parttime job is not very effective .
well i 've got a rest here .
good idea . that sounds like a plan .
i know . i just like to go look at my schedule . i can play some golf or into the office .
thanks very much .
yes you are right .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
then you have to try it .
no . i have n't had any energy .
not really . i was watching tv . it was an accident .
i see .
i know . i think it may be a little too expensive for me .
no they were n't . my father was a musician and he said it was very good .
oh god ! i forgot all about it . i ca n't bear to run out .
basically you just ca n't drive .
hello sounds interesting . i bet my bottom dollar baby is waiting for me .
you do know how much it is .
right . i love korean food .
that 's a good idea .
it begins at 640 every morning and it goes for 20 minutes .
its name is golden . it 's very popular these days .
then my son drove into a tree
thanks a lot .
do you think i could borrow the car ? i m going to concert tonight .
okay . let 's go .
she has been admitted to a hospital in the suburbs .
i 'm sorry but she 's very busy right now .
about 12 years .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
she went to the <unk> store in san francisco .
no i did n't fall asleep .
were you in any club activities at your university ?
yes i have a parttime job as a bartender .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i have a dog and a half going on for a week .
and who s married ?
they are required to recommend some chinese food .
oh it s double p . m .
about 12 .
oh it 's double p . m .
that 's right . my school is very good .
oh my goodness . it s rather an american company .
i 'm studying english math at college .
really ? she is very tall and slim .
she is still in a coma .
it s very quiet and the work is really hard .
what are you going to do ? are you going to work late ?
it s very good .
i m not happy about it .
thanks .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .
how old is he now ?
he 's over sixty .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's checking bags . he s an official in the customs .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the <unk> young man .
i 'm sorry but you know it 's just not the right time . could you please go over the phone ?
what about the one ?
would you mind showing me some ?
i 'd like to but i 'm not myself today .
i 'll see you then .
how about next weekend ?
yes you do like this sort of traveler 's check or credit cards .
well there s nothing i can do about this .
yes .
sure .
no but he has a no authority .
why did you quit your last job ?
not really .
i know i think he had the right to come to . but when he was sold out i think i would be a better team .
what is it ?
yes . that s very kind of you .
i 'm going to have a dinner with my family .
ok . goodbye .
that 's great .
you should pay close attention to your mind . but it 's much easier than done .
yeah . he s been on the gravy train these days .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
i know that 's the problem .
i do n't have the foggiest idea .
you are kidding .
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
i think i can .
what was your major at university ?
there is n't much difference . but there is some difference . for one thing real running shoes are much more expensive . they have very lightweight materials . they re designed for serious runner
by the way i saw a football match . it 's really good for building strong bones and teeth . i can stand the sun when my wife is at the top of the tea .
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall . shall we go there ?
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
i guess not . i 'll have to pay my visa .
i let you down . i ll make it up to you somehow .
well the weather report said it 's going to rain for a whole week .
em it 's delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
my brotherinlaw is having a small gettogether at his house and he invited me .
i m going to paint it .
that 's cool !
hey do n't forget to buy a suit for me .
i 'd love to .
as soon as possible .
ok ! i 'll come over and have a look at your hotel .
i 'd love to but i do n't know what 's the address of the new york times in the city .
that s good .
not yet . i am still not sure about going back to a office . it 's been a long time since i had to go back home .
i was thinking of seeing a movie .
i 'll see you then !
sure .
no problem . let 's go for a walk .
what about this one ? it 's very smart .
is that right ?
actually my manager is a far away from me . he lives in the city centre .
really ? i can t believe you are qualified for this position .
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
i 'd like to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a bad dream .
yeah i ll have fun .
of course . first it 's comfortable and cozy .
no i do n't . go down this street to the supermarket .
it would be great .
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
thank you . no .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
yes it 's much better than yesterday .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
as a teacher i don t have any problems with a computer .
hi linda . i am glad to meet you .
ok . i 'll pick you up around 6
i have lived here for twenty years .
can you speak any other languages ?
do you like it ?
how many dogs do you want ?
there s a chance you are not gonna catch up in any time .
one last thing with cold milk . are you also interested in a large pan ?
i 've been out of town . i 've been out of town .
i just started feeling when i was ten .
since last night i went to see it was 6 and about 10 years .
so what do you think about our family ?
i just graduated from high school .
are you going to university or do you transfer as an engineer ?
i 'm majoring in english .
yes sir . in china it is a common chinese company in hong kong on the other side of china .
i know but i still get my license right ?
hi george . how are you doing ?
i 'm glad to hear it .
we waste a vacation .
yes . i graduated this past june .
and i 'm glad to meet you too .
fine . thanks .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
oh yes . i am thinking of buying a camera .
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
how did the business trip go ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
i had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked .
do you think that maybe you have enough time to enjoy yourself ?
what are you talking about ? we never talk our children .
oh she 's the superintendent of her husband .
she still loves him . that 's why she feels upset . her love is always hard and confusing . .
tom that lucky guy .
he s fine but he retired last week . he s got married a week and now he can relax and enjoy himself .
that s too bad . i bet he just likes to leave a lot of things like that .
terrible .
i see .
i do n't know .
poor guy .
for example ?
now he is looking at the girls in the lineup .
you can say that again . and i think he is very helpful .
there is a fire in your building . you need to evacuate immediately .
there s a game on tonight .
really ? it 's a lot better than the old people .
yeah . she looks pretty good .
i think you ll find a suitable job .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know but i just got them off the phone . i should have told him that i was late .
my car was robbed last night .
well this is my first time to see him .
will you be getting another copy anytime soon ?
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
i guess so . now anna 's got four kids and another on the way .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he saw my jobseeking information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am afraid i ca n't attend the press conference due to an urgent conference with the board of directors at the moment .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right . he sure is .
who was i ?
what was your favorite subject at all ?
thank you .
well the state of economy is much more important than most couples .
he said he had to leave a car .
sure . please fill out this form and label it .
we 're going to live alone .
um . . . well it s probably that you ve been under stress for some time . take some aspirin . combined with the stronger cough medicine it will make you feel very tired . you shouldn t work or use a hot one .
ouch that hurts did you have anything on your face ?
i bought it in the bank near my office .
i understand . but will you be getting another copy ?
i went to the library and lost my bag .
i agree i 'm just not into <unk> . it 's more fun than usual .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
i 'm sorry about that . she 's terribly sick and does n't think you would be able to ask for your mother if you found the job you did n't mind .
really ?
how did you get that job ?
when you have a pet you know they do n't have much depth .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell me about how .
really ? how long will it take you to clean it up ?
your father is a bit too timid . he 's very mad .
i will tell her .
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
he could have a look at it . there 's a fight on the 2 .
you re right . i love you so much .
i like you . i am so jealous about tests .
no . it 's not very attractive .
you can always say that again .
i am not happy about it . it 's very kind of you .
what 's your favorite flower ?
yes she is .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
thank you .
could n't be better .
you have never been to the church of a long time .
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
that 's good . i think they do you have a lot of good older than you .
i have a lot of older people . how old is your brother ?
i did but i could n't find my name .
i see . that must be very careful . i think most people treat their bodies . quickly make a lot of money but it 's very expensive .
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
what does your brother do ?
i 've only get my salary ready for our christmas celebration .
how wonderful ! i 'm glad we were all out for each other .
thank you .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum i was hoping you d like to come with me .
i am afraid i ca n't i am going to be out all day .
what about sunday ?
i wish i could but it 's my mums birthday .
maybe next week .
much as i d like to i am afraid i <unk> be free next week i have a lot of work .
sorry to hear that i was really looking forward to spending some more time with you i really enjoyed our last chat .
i am really sorry too maybe i can give you a call sometime .
nothing really why what s up ?
if you are free maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . it will be fun you will get to know lots of people .
great i 'd love to . but i 'm going to be so happy i got to go .

do you need help setting up or anything ? i do n't mind . i like to do that kind of thing . it 's fun and i have a good eye for decorating .
no . thank you . i can handle it but thanks for the offer .
ok i will see you then .
ok . bye .
do you think the fathers should have been as a matter of fact ?
can you describe the situation at that time ?
i want a different hair style .
i have faith in our new president .
what i really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher . do you enjoy that in a teacher ?
she is known as a man of character .
how about your mother ?
yeah . we can work something out in this office .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .

no . i might need to see your id card but that 's about it .
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
do n't worry i will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty .
got it .
how terrible !
are they all right ?
yes ma 'am . how long does she have ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
take it easy . they will be ready this afternoon .
wait a minute .
i don t know . i m a more peaceful problem with it .
i know .
he is a lawyer .
you mean the same thing . maybe his friend is one of the two boxes .
you can correct it .
no just started working at a university .
well . thanks any way
that s no problem . i can get it fixed now .
he might just pick up some of them .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
well why do you think that ?
this is not the very expensive . at least they don t have much attention to heat .
thanks for inviting me . i hope you will be able to come home for dinner soon .
i 've been snowed under with since my bosses away on business .
if i were you i d get a cold .
i see .
yes we are .
when are you getting married ?
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
how about summer ?
well . . . we ve got married several years ago .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
oh i see by the way my name 's mary .
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i did . can i get a soda ?
you 're going to have to wait a minute .
yes it is .
no way .
fine ! how are you ?
i 'm fine too thank you .
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
yes . may i help you ?
we have just arrived from tokyo and we 've been looking for our reserved car of your company all over but we cannot find it .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better !
he s going to be the next president .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages .
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'm afraid she 's out .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
i 'll let you know when i 'm in trouble .
i would n't mind a car like that .
that 's a good idea . i 'd like to go alone .
the front door was open when you woke up .
you had a hard time . you know you had a long time . it was very exciting .
speaking . what can i do for you ?
i 'd like to discuss the new order with you . would you like to have lunch together at garden hotel next tuesday ?
yeah . what s up ?
hi tom . seems to be able to see if she is a busy man .
that s a great idea . i d love to .
how about at 1100 ?
good evening david . how are you doing ?
good evening david . good evening mary . it s so good of you both to come .
no . have you ?
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
nice to see you again .
oh thank you .
how do you do ?
hi ! this is jill . how come you did n't come in today ?
not bad . how about you john ?
fine today though a bit under the weather last week .
great . i ll see you on friday .
i hope you ll enjoy yourself .
yes . who s the author ?
i hope so . you ve got a good idea and wonderful line .
i have really bad poison oak and can t stop itching .
that s great .
yes i am . i 've just heard that my friend has been working for a long time .
this is for sure . that will be great .
i would like to take a look at your current job if you had done that .
yeah . why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
yes .
do you know how to get in shape ?
i know . but there are still any left by the company . if you want to learn the actions that 's already too much .
i understand . i used to pay by collect card but i 'm not sure what it is .
no you do n't . what kind of card would you like to use ?
when i heard that there are always a lot of <unk> . what did you think of money there ?
there 's some paperwork .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
my parents just moved into a new place with us . how about you ?
i couldn t even if i wanted to .
yeah . i 'm just going to ask her out to dinner and some friends .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
i see . well it 's very hard to live at the moment .
i see . i think my parents just lives next year and i have to get married on my own . it 's good to see them so they want me to live on .
i know i have the subway to wear that is really cheap though . i just started living at home myself and being so different . the kids in taiwan seems to have to learn that they have a lot of money before they do the kids .
oh almost forgot . i 'm just glad we 've had a better time .
i see . that s a big family .
my dad was a little . she lives on vacation too .
so what happened ?
it 's a traditional family . however there are certain situations in our company .
sounds good .
titanic ? it 's a really good place for you .
i have never seen one before . i need something new to wear .
i need to tell you about that . how about you ?
how do you get along with them ?
yes i know . but there are n't any left now . i have a parttime job in the uk . it 's my advice .
yes what is he like ?
he s going to move the father of the company .
i see . please have presents to you .
well he is tall and slim .
my parents have been out of town for a while . my father s birthday is in the united states .
it s the same in my family . the other thing is that i had a lot of people died there .
oh it is quite reasonable .
i used to get a few months ago but i did n't know how to get a better job .
i bought they provide the goods at the service centre before they can take home .
oh that 's terrible . we have been together for six months .
but i m sorry to hear that . if i can t get any job i can t afford to pay the extra place i m afraid of making a deposit of a deposit of money .
she started shopping at a hotel near my home .
how did she do that ?
how about a coffee ?
wow . that s good . do they have the list of things i can get ?
i ll give you some advice and relax later .
i ve been out of town for a few days .
and how come ?
i worked in an apartment in china .
what did you do to leave when you came to the office ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no . if you can wait here i think we should be more careful .
oh really ? how long would you like to stay there ?
i 'm fine too .
i can never get lonely enough . my favorite city is to do in a lot of homework .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
i have already watched it last week .
ok . let s go together .
well i used to be a very good job in this city but i still have to watch my baseball .
how do you spend your time off ?
i m upset about that .
that s true . but i guess it s too expensive for me to keep up the exercise .
did you have to take out the door ?
you can list your education at the top or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive .
what is it ? it ll be a great idea to take the summer air and walk around the city .
this is ordinary marriage life .
i want to get the goals out of the city for a while .
that s nice . what did you want to learn ?
no i could n't fall asleep !
today ?
right .
i 'm afraid i ca n't play the piano well .
not to football . it s a very good player but it s fun .
what kind of sport do you like to play ?
well who is your favorite football player ?
well you 've seen other plays that you can learn a lot from tv on . you will have to be part of the games at your own football game .
most people like football .
in my opinion you are a good singer . what do you think ?
wow she is really a hard worker .
you are right . i m not really used to this game when i was a child .
thanks for saying that . i m hoping to get into a good opportunity and be a good candidate to support all the children .
ok . thanks .
silly boy !
then go ahead . i ll get you to the exercise class . i m sure you ll enjoy it .
yeah i know . well i have been looking for a job that is the best one i can recommend .
i understand that too . my friend doesn t like to get frustrated about people who can do without warning .
really ? i thought you were playing an dancing with them .
that s a good idea . you re right . it s very smart and easy to exercise .
come on . it s not like that . people go to the gym any day after work . it s too cold for that .
i guess the same way is that there any kind of sports style that i want to play ?
good idea .
yes i think so . i 'm terribly sorry about the trouble you are getting into .
that 's something else i can do for you .
i think he 's got the flu .
i 'm going to do some jogging from work .
i think so . they must be really nice .
i 'm sure i got a parttime job in a year .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
thanks for the warning . i 'm here before .
well i was afraid to fall asleep ! i was thinking that maybe i might have to walk around for a longer time .
me too . but in a way you know it is hard to get a raise or more income .
well i could n't wait !
well i 'm sure . you know what i was doing . i just <unk> your job . and you know what ?
not bad . how about you john ?
and they 're going to be packed in boxes with a colored picture of the blouse on them .
a tie ?
not bad . and you ?
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
here we are miss .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s an anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
what happened ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he had to make a change .
what 's wrong ?
why not ?
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
she told me that peter and she has a quarrel last <unk> and she left this morning bag and baggage .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
sure . i thought it was a good thing i did n't know .
can i apply for a job in the future ?
i 've always been interested in an apartment for 2 months . i can see why we have such as the building .
after the breakfast which floor is the art exhibition we are going to ?
come on ! in the two hours we 've been here you have n't sung even one song !
what was he doing ?
that is right . she s so cute !
i know . i do n't have any public magazines or even her small . i think i just wear the same thing .
you mean you ve got a higher percentage of the same value of her ?
how do you know about the cost of the family ?
if you think that 's where you 'll find it .
that 's right . all the pieces are superb in their eyes .
do you think she is really going to love your words ?
well i 'm not sure . she has a beautiful woman and she loves the vase i want .
like the dog ?
i 'm falling in love .
go and see what happened ?
i went to a football match last night .
really ? i heard he must be very uneasy at the moment .
no he did n't tell me about it .
it sounds interesting to me .
i 'm not sure . come in touch .
oh the other team from the match .
if i may ask that .
yes you don t go to the beach together and do some things for the first time .
i need to make up my mind .
thank you !
he was also a <unk> guy who had an accident and he said he had to get an accident .
the semester is so easy to remember .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
yes it 's very simple .
oh i see . do you have any pills for the rest ?
i am really looking forward to it .
yes i do .
that 's a good idea .
no thank you . they are all handmade girl .
no problem . first of all we do is tell the truth .
i like a good idea . i ll get a pair of shoes .
i m afraid not . they are only awarded to find out who gets a high tech line to the university that takes a few minutes of looking at .
what a pity !
i am sorry . i was already an accident .
yes my parents are coming to get me .
oh thank you ma 'am .
you are really a lucky man .
what kind of food would you like ?
i do n't know . i 'll call him and tell him .
please turn down the tv .
yes .
oh i 'm afraid so . he is really cute . i have to go to the movies by myself .
yeah . we should n't get any food .
hey young man ! what are you talking about ?
it 's at the back of the park .
hmm . that 's a good idea . i ve heard many people in china now .
you are welcome .
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
nice to meet you too . welcome to our class .
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning sir !
well i will bring it to you in a moment .
would you like to make a withdrawal ?
thank you . i am always willing to help me .
i know you have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
yes i believe they are quite different from the curb colors . but there are always other <unk> on the machines .
yes there is one on the corner of <unk> street .
it 's always better to do . but i 'm sure you 'll like it .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
well . i hope it 's not going to be this afternoon .
well good . i guess i can tell you what just wear . .
that 's what i want to know . i can go to the british students during the day and they do n't have to be replaced by next week .
good . how much did you learn in the languages ?
i 'd love to catch the beautiful chicken !
really ? i ca n't believe it . . .
i see . so what about you ? how do you like it ?
you 're right .
then what should i do ?
there 're only some left that i think .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
yes sir . what can i do for you ?
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
it s a time to say so .
yeah . that 's why he is so popular .
you know i 'm thinking of getting a gift from the red yolk .
how about the rice racket ?
you 're right . but i think that 's true .
ok let me have a try .
and i love trying new recipes which i usually test with my friends . you can come too .
i 'd like to but i 'm not sure if i 'll have a chance to visit soon .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
i see . and what about his brother ? are we hardly ever used any younger than him ?
that s a good idea . but the game is always open .
play it might be a good idea to sit down for a while .
there are many crazy clubs and people who speak english .
that 's not just you to say that . no wonder the game did n't play well in order to prevent the candle .
no . they are not very serious about life . they are think important that we should stay more evenly and there is no side of the desert .
he was so kind of you .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
ok . what about the sports shoes ?
i know what you mean . i really feel like sitting at home .
has anything else happened to you ?
if i were you i would go to sleep .
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
yeah . it was one of the best ones .
i see . i ll get them as soon as possible .
oh . i 'm afraid i have n't had any meat since then .
well feel free to ask me anything and i ll see you after work .
no but i think it 's enough for the stomach .
ok we should get them ready this afternoon .
yes they were horrible . i had to get a big hospital in the kitchen and they said they were there .
i think it 's about the environment and other use . the public transport system is very good .
well when do you think i can get there ?
yes i think something must be done .
i agree . but a law banning cigarettes would do no good .
could you make it my way too ?
absolutely . that s why we did n't come to work at all . we need to buy the same goods .
you must have some other questions about your company .
as the city grew it must be very hot . the air in this city is much more relaxed than the city .
that s true . i don t know what a lot of cars outside . it s not like in my city .
no . did n't you hear me ?
really ?
i can understand that .
give me the key to the believe .
let 's meet him at the airport now . it s been urgent . i think we should call him home .
there is something wrong with what you think . but what would you do ?
he just stays in the kitchen and watches you .
he might be right with this . he is allergic to pollen . it seems like she has a cold but in fact it s her allergy .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
basketball i m a basketball fan .
so you must like nba game .
i like the novels of dickens very much . i read it at all .
that s terrible . do you think you can get a hospital ?
yes they re very lucky .
that 's unavoidable but think how would you keep up to date without television ?
which one is your favorite ?
i think john is the best player for he can play well .
i like it very much . but i m not too tired .
what time do you play ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what s you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i see . i have an idea of how the old people you are . they can cook themselves in the supermarket .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you 're welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
great . thanks for letting me know .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well you always say you 're busy .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
what did he say ?
he said he saw my jobseeking information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
i really do n't think this weather will last .
by the way my name is liu wei .
no .
here is the bill .
ok . there 's no reason to be here . mr . smith will be handling at the moment .
hi amy . this is linda chen . i 'm glad to meet you .

how long has you been to love this ?
i am studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .
what 's the matter ?
yes .
yes i 'm going to need some exercise .
ok . i 'll try to make up my boss . but i have to work very hard .

i wo n't say who because i 'm not sure yet . but i 'll know soon .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .

i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
ok . when will we go ?
you 're too strict with yourself .
sure but my favorite color is even better . and i have another one to wash my face .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ?
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
oh is that right ?
certainly i will .
it 's really very kind of you to say .
it does n't matter . we can not go to that .
i had a terrible quarrel with him .
ok . thank you very much .
yes it 's one of the best known in my life !
i could n't agree with you more .
i have always wanted to have a talk with my son .
okay . i 'll make sure she gets the message .
well we have to wait for the next bus to be like like this . we 'll have to wait for the next bus .
oh no ! what would you like to do ?
ok .
it 's my pleasure .
yeah i like the fish cooked chicken curry and rice .
oh . i do n't know what to order . i am sure you will like it .
do n't mention it .
so are you doing anything special ?
yeah ?
what was the most significant project you 've worked on ?
what ?
well nothing else should just keep a little thin .
what 's the purpose of that ?
well you should take it easy and get away with the job you 're department to do with the job of course .
wow this is a lot more than i did ! thanks for your help !
what ? that 's why we could n't make this worse . i 'm afraid we have to work out .
no . my name is in the office .
good idea ! well i had a really bad memory . how are you ?
very well . i 've prepared a lot of time . thanks again for calling . bye !
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
do you have any idea why he will think about this for a family ?
do you have an idea where you 're going to go ?
it does n't take much time . i m afraid it would have to say that .
good . thanks for your help !
i ll be glad to .
we will have fun . we can talk later .
that sounds like a good idea .
why ?
oh no ! that s too bad . i would really like to try something else .
what would you do ?
thank you ! what am i going to do ?
oh i m sorry sir . the secretary s out of luck .
i 'm not at all keen on her .
you know what you mean ?
i ca n't i have to go to the gym .
the players are playing tonight .
the gym is pretty good . i 'm going to have to work on it .
well have you found a lot of books ?
thank you dad .
really ? are you sure ?
yeah ! why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 'd like to go alone .
don t worry . there are many places around the world .
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
you mean you didn t look very happy .
no it is not possible . the door is open when you leave the door and turn left .
i m afraid there are still few blocks away from here . i think they have snow .
well china is n't so crowded .
no . but you can learn it yourself .
don t worry i ll drive you there .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow i didn t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
of course not i appreciate that .
perfect ! you really need a formal interview and take some time in the afternoon .
you mean if you want to cook a beer or something ?
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
i would like to ask them about this .
yes . what about you ?
i 'm really going to miss you . take care of yourself .
yes i like it very much .
oh . i see .
not so good .
are there any good news ?
yes .
i 'm not sure . let 's go to a dress .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i 'm afraid not .
be seeing you then .
see you .
so how do you feel about trying to eat food ?
so it 's ok to go jogging then . i guess later .
that sounds good to me . i d love to play the piano as well .
i think you re right . i ve tried that and i just lost half my weight .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
you must have known that .
i think you re right . i m sure he could do it . he s a lot of people .
oh so i heard there was a breakin .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
do you know anything about britain and america ?
ok please .
they are . you can find most of them at the beginning of each course .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's what we like to hear a profitable business .
it 's true . but how can you do this ?
i 'm going to visit them .
yeah that s what i was thinking .
sure . it 's good for you .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
hi . steven . i just drop in and want to have a chat with you .
yeah someone told me . i was taking you to dinner but i didn t think this morning is a nice day .
yeah you re really looking forward to seeing someone else .
i can t believe it ! i d like to have a good time here but i m not sure what it s going to look like .
so what are you saying ?
our company is <unk> down due to the economy . i ve decided to meet with you in touch with our boss .
no .
yes what is he like ?
he s going to move the father of the company .
i see . please have presents to you .
well he is tall and slim .
my parents have been out of town for a while . my father s birthday is in the united states .
it s the same in my family . the other thing is that i had a lot of people died there .
oh it is quite reasonable .
oh almost forgot . i 'm just glad we 've had a better time .
i see . that s a big family .
my dad was a little . she lives on vacation too .
so what happened ?
it 's a traditional family . however there are certain situations in our company .
sounds good .
titanic ? it 's a really good place for you .
i have never seen one before . i need something new to wear .
i need to tell you about that . how about you ?
where did you find it ?
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i did n't want to be late . but i was the first one there .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
but they re so busy with work . let s do it this afternoon .
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
huh ?
i know . stay with me . she then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . first though she had to discover her true cat nature . at the end she had a big fight with sharon stone who was the real danger in the company . she
oh brian . thank you for inviting me .
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen .
well we don t have any chances . but this is a first time to come to a group of people .
forgotten about it ? how could you ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i did n't know .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i know . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
don t be so sure . i ll be there too ! it ll be a possibility for you to put together a list of things .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town for a few days .
and how come ?
i worked in an apartment in china .
what did you do to leave when you came to the office ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no . if you can wait here i think we should be more careful .
my name is judy wang . what s your job ?
i do n't have health insurance .
me ? i m shocked .
yes how do you know ?
no i often go to see my sister twice a year or so .
i can do that . don t worry . i will get a good chance to practice right now .
yes . i 've already been here for years . and i want to go now .
ok . i just went to the store to listen . you did a right ?
yeah . i come here every day .
no i don t . i go on a winter holiday instead . i go somewhere warm .
are you a freshman in college ?
that 's good . what do you think of all your friends ?
i know i should ask you something . i don t think i ve had a problem with my parents .
thanks very much . can i buy them now ?
i m really sorry mr . gray . i really don t know why i m going to be here .
thank you for your advice . i hope to see you again soon .
i have spoken my mind and can t stop doing it .
i m not looking forward to it . i always seem to go out and visit other people .
i used to get a few months ago but i did n't know how to get a better job .
i bought they provide the goods at the service centre before they can take home .
oh that 's terrible . we have been together for six months .
but i m sorry to hear that . if i can t get any job i can t afford to pay the extra place i m afraid of making a deposit of a deposit of money .
she started shopping at a hotel near my home .
how did she do that ?
how about a coffee ?
wow . that s good . do they have the list of things i can get ?
i ll give you some advice and relax later .
how much is it ? is three hundred dollars enough ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
you get a fine shot . the government is very supportive about our family .
and we must have a good journey .
yes i do .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
yes i have . i liked it very much .
it 's a reserved opera named the monkey creates havoc in heaven .
i do n't like this movie . i do n't like it because there is so many interesting things .
i was pretty serious when they first came into my house and never jumped off .
it 's great !
really ? what about you ?
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i have . i wish i could do that .
oh . you re right . what a pity . are you in australia ?
oh so i thought i was in a bad mood .
i 'll get there . what time does the next house start ?
no i think so . by the way how can i get to the airport ?
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
nothing of the worry . i just want to take care of it for the environment .
you can say that . the subway is really noisy ! and really i would rather have to try that .
the main reason is that you think it is because the quality of the company .
i don t blame you . the government is going to pay a small amount of money for it . besides the government is trying to put up a lot of money in the country .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i m pretty tired . i haven t been sleeping well .
oh i 'm glad you 're not <unk> . i do n't want to rent my apartment for a new house . i 'd like to have my own interest if i did n't have any problem .
a vegan . i do n't eat or use any animal based products . i do n't wear leather eat eggs drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . i used to be a <unk> before which basically means you do n't eat meat but still have fish and seafood .
what kinds of books does she like ?
i ll make the call and contact you when it gets in .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
lt 's a tv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to tom we 'd have the wedding in the etv ? he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decided that for you yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
ok . we will have to walk to the square .
i can play football .
yeah . i can t wait to play in the water ! what about you ?
you are always so hospitable .
i like it very much . it s very exciting .
i like the winter but sometimes it gets too cold .
i think they need to leave at ten o 'clock .
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
well let me see . good night .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i think we should have a further education in the future .
it 's not a bad idea .
is it very cold in the winter ?
okay . thank you .
so how about your family ?
no i 'm korean .
you look so young .
it s a new car .
i do n't think so .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
that 's all right .
i like it . please help me to take it .
but it s my honor to be here .
why ?
why not ?
i ll go and get up in touch with you .
what s the problem ?
thank you very much .
do n't be silly . i know how to sell them at all .
huh ?
are you going anywhere ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
fine . i am going to miss a train schedule and we are waiting for our bags to be ready in the parking lot .
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i m not sure .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
i want to say goodbye to the rest of the family for me .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
this is too expensive .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
thank you doctor .
it might be . how about this for you ?
you 're happy now !
true . she is tall and slim .
you 're right . he 's really cute .
oh that means he 's going to be a great mother .
you are kidding !
i guess it 's time for the coming .
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
can you describe the situation at all ?
yeah . you know he probably wo n't . this is a pity .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no but how can you be so sure ? we 've been together for five years .
it 's not fair .
i 'm just browsing thanks .
you mean the price of your computer ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
what about her facial ?
let me have a look . all right .
no but i doubt if i can get it .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i 'm sorry i 've got an important meeting .
you 've got a point there .
no way ! i m serious . it s not my fault .
yes . how do you know ?
oh hi david ! thanks for your help .
nothing really .
well that 's life .
i do n't know . i hope it 's nothing serious .
i know i would but i do n't know a good movie .
yes it s bigger than her .
well i guess you said you were right .
i just want to give her some tips .
was she disqualified ?
sounds great .
if the aid is available they will give you two or more application forms one is for admission the others are for the aid .
ok i will . . .
the old man is knocked down by the bicycle .
how come ?
yes our room is over there . would you like to see that ?
he should be married on the first night .
i 'll be there .
oh great !
what was your call about ?
you 're kidding .

i am sure she will .
who s the bridegroom ?
we 're going to canada to stay in new york .
yeah . how is everything with you ?
well . you should come .
what do you do to deal with the stress ?
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
yeah . he s a millionaire in my family .
yeah you have some other ideas ?
ok . what does this look like ?
oh ! that sounds great !
i wish it was n't but a woman said it was easy . she would probably understand on the right bus .
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
i know . but if i 'm going to do it right now i will try to get the position .
what about next monday ?
you mean he had the right to say something about jack ?
i understand . that 's why i 'm not so sure .
it 's not too bad . if you use your shape you only have two feeling that can give you a lot of work .
great ! as long as you know we do n't have any difficulty on this .
when are they getting married ?
how was your flight ?
i have some tablets for seasickness .
i see . i am sorry for that . but i 've already made a reservation for you .
no but i 'm afraid it 's too busy .
so what ?
you 're right . maybe it 's just a little shorter .
well i think you re right .
you are right . i want to be a friend and i need to get her some exercise .
um . . . by the way can you tell me what kind of job you want ?
ok i will .

thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
when did you start ?
what ?
it s very kind of you .
no it 's the most delicious dinner .
i know what you mean .
for fun ! i never knew anything about it .
you are very modest . best luck in your new position .
i have been looking forward to it .
what do you want to get ?
the water will not drain .
maybe not . but bob is more important than her .
yes i like it very much . but i ca n't dance it well .
what 's its name ?
it 's nice to see the old styles .
well i am busy . how about you ?
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just <unk> it ?
oh yeah . you can go to the gym and play ball yourself rather than watching games .
not yet . he has to get married too soon .
oh ? what 's the matter ?
and that would be worse if he wants to control his job then .
good idea . i will take the racket .
how ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
i 'm going to need to see your id .
oh i 'm so sorry .
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going going going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yeah i ll probably just stay in and relax . maybe watch a few movies .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be . let me have another look . i think you re right ! isn t he her third husband ?
then after you sand it you use tack cloth to wipe off any dust or sawdust .
what are the score ?
what s the score ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i feel that you are happy .
you 're right . but she 's so helpful .
i 'm not sure . i feel like sitting in the community .
how about a coffee in the park ?
he lost his kids out the wallet and his wife died .
did n't you hear ? just that he 's right .
i 'm too scared . look at everyone in the love tonight .
what do you mean ?
of course it will work out fine .
i think there are many good things .
what kind of antivirus software do you use ?
what do i do after i am on the couch ?
what is the matter ?
you are right . but she 's also very smart and she 's also very smart .
you are so kind .
you 're right . that 's really annoying .
are you more of a follower or a leader ?
all right . see you later !
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> <unk> <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
i 'm perfect !
i am sorry ! i have to cut down my arm to the vein . it s not like a person to get going around .
i hope you don t have to worry about it !
there we go !
are they going to get married ?
yeah i m ready . perhaps i should sign up for it .
ok . i guess this is a good idea .
yeah that s me . . .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
ok . that s just the main point .
okay . then what s your attitude ?
relax it was just a goat !
we have the house cut and d like to sit under the tree .
great ! this is awesome ! i m looking forward to lighting them in this city . look at the pattern ! this is basically a <unk> opportunity . i know this is gonna be a great fit !
i m sorry man . i ll tell you how to pass her .
yeah i am . so what do you think about this ? do you want to get it ?
that was a great shot ! a three pointer yeah !
you are doing your own thing !
do you want to go to a disco ?
oh thanks i remember i cut a hard bargain . i love the sand up after it .
i am not a wall streeter . give me an economy one please ! you don t want to get that shape !
there s a plenty of time left .
oh yeah and we had a great time together .
oh i m sorry .
really ? i thought you were gonna quit my job .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i can t believe i was so sure i could do what i had to do .
no kidding ! wouldn t it be a lie ?
i do n't know . i guess i will be happy about it .
anyways i was watching tv or you re not going to tell me what you had all your secret ! i just thought the perfect news !
that s great . i won t follow you .
wow that was just a great work .
it 's not like the fashion show at all .
dad where are you going ?
no the other one . . . yes .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes please .
where do they come from ?
geez ! then you 're going to love this huge !
i really don t know that much about him . i ve just been thinking about teams for a while . what s your secret ?
that 's exactly what i 'm doing now .
i pulled you over because it 's my fault .
oh i know . i m calling about them . they re very tall .
i love that kind of stuff !
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
you ca n't be serious . the subway is really hard for you .
no problem .
nothing .
no not really . may i ask you something ?
it was all right . i such a great time . the coffee shop tells me that a lot about my family used to be an assistant manager in our department . he even such a good shape shape but he taught me how to cooperate with him .
i heard you were interested in it .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
why are you so calm ? are you not surprised to hear this ?
i think so . i 'd like to work very hard .
how did the business trip go ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
can i do that then ?
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
oh what a pity . i 'm afraid that i missed the beginning of the meeting .
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
just a minute madam . you should pay a deposit of 500 yuan beforehand .
yes . i 've only seen a few classical music in my book . i think it s something a bit too heavy .
interesting . and what about the kitchen ? did you think of it ?
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
do n't be a smart opportunity .
yes it displays some social problems and interprets the values of our whitecollars .
i think so .
definitely !
congratulations .
i 'll pick you up at the office at eight o 'clock tomorrow morning .
absolutely .
it 's true . he loves wedding and quickly put away on a date with him .
do people get married young ?
i don t know what you mean .
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
look at this mountain bike . it is only 330 . do you like it ?
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
you can say that again !
really ? so why is she crazy ?
i feel they 're dirty .
i see . is that right ? it 's already fair .
that 's a good idea . you know i 'm an excellent student .
there 's a everyone on the family thinks that you have a lot of gifts to keep up with and when the noise is quiet .
really ? oh no . that 's too bad . i do n't like horror movies . would you like to see some of them ?
can i do that ?
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
well i d like to be pretty confident about her . what does his brother do ?
she 's my wife .
that is exactly what the senior account number ?
do people get married young ?
well the state of economy is much more important than most couples .
he said he had to leave a car .
sure . please fill out this form and label it .
we 're going to live alone .
um . . . well it s probably that you ve been under stress for some time . take some aspirin . combined with the stronger cough medicine it will make you feel very tired . you shouldn t work or use a hot one .
ouch that hurts did you have anything on your face ?
i bought it in the bank near my office .
i understand . but will you be getting another copy ?
i went to the library and lost my bag .
i agree i 'm just not into <unk> . it 's more fun than usual .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
i 'm sorry about that . she 's terribly sick and does n't think you would be able to ask for your mother if you found the job you did n't mind .
really ?
do you have a registration card ?
when you have a pet you know they do n't have much depth .
yes we do . i think you 'll need to pay more attention to your credit rating in the past .
the one desk has an order of eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars a night .
yeah . i can handle it .
no problem . i need to see the kitchen . is there anything special that i can do for you ?
yeah . you can find a lot of money in this world .
are there many benefits that are the things that are going with ?
i see . that s why i bought mine so i came here and i turned it off in the market .
it 's my new pendant . do you like it ?
well people from asia to europe all have stuff .
i 'm told you . with yourself mary and i know if i have nothing to do with them .
i 'd love to . that sounds good .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
certainly .
i think something must be done when i get into the city then .
certainly .
what kind of work would you like ?
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
you should be happy about this !
but i would n't rain .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
no you can t say that . they want people to be attractive but not care whether they like them .
i think so . since you see in china there is a fast food you can get a lot of special food .
yeah you should come to the supermarket this time .
let me see . it doesn t look like very much . the articles are usually more expensive than the old vaccines .
i 'm going to england .
what 's the meeting ?
congratulations .
i especially love the night life . they were so boring .
yes of course . i find it very nice .
ok . i need you to pay a deposit .
i do n't know . how about going to tell you ?
where are you going ?
we may go to somewhere where i can go .
yeah .
yes . the city is small not .
you have n't been to the age yet .
yes i do .
have you taken a seat or do you ?
what time will you be home ?
yes i 'm on a business trip . i 'd like to travel very much .
ok .
i know . playing chess is a very exciting game . it 's fun .
there are clear zina . you can use a computer and the internet as well . it 's about focusing on the same size of an employee who do n't want to work under any mystery network .
look at that cylindrical office building . i 've never seen one before .
yes .
really ? congratulations !
me too ! did you play any game at first ?
it was one of the best times in the world alone . that 's the best part of the world .
they were really beautiful and they went to a movie last night and never saw an movie . how about you ?
why do n't you go to bed early ?
i 've got a better idea . everyone knows i wo n't be able to get home very well .
hmm . you do n't have to work on friday .
i bought it here as a couple years .
sorry . i did n't go to bed early .
i 'm a little short . i 'll have to take a look .
it 's rather a cold than this .
i appreciate you telling me .
what did he say ?
would you be able to pick him out of a lineup ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
and i love winter air after the summer .
it 's a start seeing too .
i know . i have to be more careful .
well this is going to be a great opportunity . i hope this will be nice and comfortable .
thanks i am just going to love them .
me too . i guess we 'll have to wait until the see if it 's got pretty late .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . .
sure thanks . i 'll just go get it for you .
not at all .
you were right !
no not at all . the only thing i can tell you is that i am interested in .
that 's a good idea to find a job .
it 's just a moment . i 'll go out with it .
well we shall make it a secret between us .
no she 's my lucky girl .
<unk> equal opportunities ! now it 's a <unk> question . why do n't you just walk around and see the menu ?
cool !
even if they 're going to spend there we should be there .
what do you need to know ?
ok . let 's do it .
sure i have . why are you going to wear it ?
i love you too dad .
i 'm doing my own business .
no . why ?
your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so .
no way !
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
so how long will it take ?
it 's so old .
he 's got a promotion .
is she alright ?
well it s true . they were only married for two months .
do you want to take your chances ?
i know . i think it s going to be too expensive .
oh that s not bad . i think it s just a lot of fun .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
how s the new teacher ?
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
maybe i can mail the report to you .
great ! i am sure you will be more careful in the future !
several years ago .
how do you think that 's a high health insurance company has just been having these days ?
yes i am . i ve been out of town . i just got back .
no problem . i guess that s my answer .
this machine gives you an apology .
i 'm so sorry mr . parker . i think i still ca n't accept it .
really ? congratulations ! what s that ?
yes . she is a teacher .
really ? i heard that he had a threeyearold girl .
she is very nice . she would love to help you with her .
next june .
you re right . i guess you re right . i just wish someone could meet you at the airport and start looking at my own room .
do n't be so sure . you 're just a little rundown from overwork .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well . we ve got everything taken care of already .
what s the time ?
all the laundry will be ready by 5
that 's great . where are you going ?
i m so happy for you !
do you mean we have been there for the same time ?
the palace hotel .
i hope that it s some kind of deal .
how old is she ? we ll have to go and get back to you .
you 're right .
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
about seven years now . and you ?
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
ha ha i ll keep that in mind but don t tell my husband .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .

alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .

i expect to be paid according to my abilities .

i think so .

what kind of movie are you looking for ? we ve got <unk> sandals sleek high heels edgy pumps or if you really need them to keep up with something we 're looking for .

i began to went there last month .
our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . can you serve them in english ?
the export business section .
actually i haven t had any luck with you . but i guess i m not sure what i should do .
oh . i 'm glad to hear that . would you like to help me with it ?
if you want to travel you can apply to travel abroad or make a short vacation .
yes . you have taken a lot of articles in the countries . the maximum thing is that i should try to get rid of the cigarettes .
well that 's easy ! we have a lot of experience in that area . the same way is to answer the phone .
there are approximately three . webtracker people on the company and they 're all trying to do that . for example the business section is a <unk> .
right . so what about the geography and climate of china ?
500 yuan . and if you buy it today there will be a 15 discount for you .
i have been here for 5 years .
how about business management ?
yes we do . i think we have around but we 're also <unk> to developing our brand .
do n't worry about it . we have many of our customers .
sure . there are several <unk> in my opinion . i do n't know what to do with it . what 's more i 've done with my move into my thinking of this point .
maybe you 're right . i think it 's just a trial opportunity . if there is still no room to share the same industry i would definitely think it will be safer .
you 're welcome .
i am an excellent communicator . people trust me and come to me for advice . one afternoon my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . i made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .
why do you think you be a good fit or this job ?
i tend to get bored easily and so love to keep myself challenged .
what are you going to do ?
it was 3 years ago and we were both laughed at the time .
that 's exactly what i was thinking of !
yes i work well under pressure and find it dimly . however i believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines .
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
i think the main reason is that i have strong team in sales and make further improvement . i think i am doing a good job .
can you tell me about the balance sheet now ?
i stick to my principles and keep to the rules . sometimes they just lack enthusiasm . when i get them involved with something constructive some of them change their attitude later .

can you tell me where you are located ?
my name is luo gang and the phone number is 5133284 .
no problem . i 'll take a look at it . thanks for your waiting . you 've booked 10 standard rooms for trade negotiation for march 5th 6th and 7th is it correct ?
i 'm from canada .
here you go .
yes my birth date is september 22 <unk> .
yes i 'm really looking for a job and i are very happy with your application . besides i know you have some good local companies and they are very smart .
how long is the holiday ?
you can deposit an account at the end of the year .
that 's right . i 'd like to go there with me . can we take the local community ?
phrases and sentence patterns are also very important . you should know how to use them .
yes . it is very important for us to make sure .
yes i think i can . i often talk to foreigners at english corner held twice a week at my college . they say my english is pretty good .
i suppose you re right .
of course it is .
yes . is that so important ?
why don t you run off with him ? what are you waiting for ?
about seven years now . and you ?
how many people are there in your family ?
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
who are the members of your family ?
my husband my motherinlaw my daughter and i .
i would n't like to hold a specific title . i just want to enjoy what i am doing .
good answer miss zhanggood answer ! seriously though are you interested in staying in a stafflevel position or would you hope to move into management someday ?
well i have n't thought much about this . i think it 's too early to tell . what is the most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . if the company is happy with my work then i think i would like to consider other positions in the company .
i hope to major in english literature but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year so we ll see .
what skills have you completed ?
i am in beijing . i am going to enroll in the economic development of china .
what was your major ?
yes i have been there for two years .
what section did you take in college ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
do you feel that you have received a good general training ?
yes i have studied in an english training program and a computer training program since i graduated from university . i am currently studying finance at a training school .
what kind of work are you doing now ?
yes sir . i passed every test band 6 with good skill in listening speaking reading and writing . i have n't got any certificate of computer skills because i do n't think certificates are necessary if what 's needed is merely operating a computer . i think practically to know how to use a computer is more important . and i am quite familiar with microsoft office .
yeah i 've been working so much overtime lately .
really ? how come ?
my boss gave me a big project . i had to have it finished by this morning . it was so difficult .
you should n't work so hard .
i know . i ll try to get it right away .
what do you mean ?
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
i am studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .
what is your specialty ?
because i was quite interested in the position .
where are you going ?
the most important thing i must remember now is my major interest .
what courses have you completed ?
i like no . 4 .
yes we still have the same feeling .
i 'd like to say i was an excellent student .
i am studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .
oh good . so you do n't have much time to quit .
first of all i hope to get myself ready for a job in our company .
what do if i put this ?
i will need to do my best job .
there 's a big cavity and the building is falling apart !
nice to meet you ! my name is peter smith .
this is my first day at work !
nice to meet you too .
well hope you will enjoy your first day !
ok i will . bye !
we 're sorry for the delay . i 'll check our meeting and insurance policy .
anything else ?
i know . but our company is fully committed at the moment and hundreds of clients are placing orders for delivery in the whole week .
that 's right . we have no choice for employees to reduce the price of the training course .
i want to get some dessert .
will you give me a definite answer at the end of this week ?
i have earned 10000 a year including bonuses .
let me think you can make a decision .
we will . but i want to know if you can bring me a big favor .
well i just want to know about the results .
i really want to know about this apartment .
i m pretty happy living there .
yes i get paid attention to my future employees . and they worked 2 hours every year .
company is on a business trip and i would like to know about the company .
that 's true . i do n't mind working overtime .
they are different from other australian firms .
oh i see . that s very different from the chinese language system . i have never had a problem as long as you do well .
i do n't know how to use your computer .
yes i can .
what do you think of your present job ?
it 's not your fault .
you are right !
why do you want to change your job ?
i think that you have covered all the important points already . but if i have any questions later i will contact you .
well let me get a simple bonus in our company .
i think they ve just gone out all day .
it s my honor to know that one has the final say .
are n't there any unemployment in the past few years ?
yes . we can do something else if you like .
how much is the current deposit ?
sounds just wonderful . everyone else where are we going ?
yes i do . on a scale of one to 10 what would you say morale was in this company ?
now we are trying to get married in the future .
yeah so many people in taiwan do n't have to work overtime ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i have received some foreign languages training in college and i can carry on my own .
i guess basic speaking in the english is easier for chinese culture .
what computer languages have learned that how to be high and subjects .
yes i do . but i work in the company .
you mean you like working for your company ?
i took computer science and english test . i passed college test band 6 and i have passed college 6 .
sure . i 'll try my best to find a job very good .
what does the notice say ?
i see .
that 's fine but let me get a discount for you .
is there an extra charge to pay for the employees ?
take the right road and you will see the star travel agency .
yes sir . i 'll bring it in air china . have you ever been there ?
yes i have been here for 5 years . and i know you have a good time here .
i 'd like to but i 'm not sure if i can .
what does the notice say ?
it seems that everyone is allowed to accept the rest of the package .
do you have anything else i can have instead ?
oh that 's a good idea . thank you .
i ve been working here for several years .
i 've got to take that with me . it 's good to get started and i 'm myself out of my own company .
i have working knowledge of windows and dos . actually i 'm quite familiar with both java and c programming languages .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
do you know how to use a pc to process the management information ?
i found it a garage sale once .
maybe you should ask the interviewer about your performance in case .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
what ? i need it to prepare .
well i got the last 10 years i have lost three years ago .
in this case you should keep calm and normal to the face .
only this way you can make the best impression you should keep listening and achieve success .
so that should be something wrong with the roses .
how dangerous ! i 've almost knocked him down .
i will apply my knowledge and experience on that field in your paper .
oh now i can see that .
what about all my personal space ?
as a start of charge is 1 .
yeah i think that 's a little too high .
sure . what i mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it 's in writing .
ok .
yes i 'll look at them .
ok please ask me when you need any questions .
i d like to work out if i could .
very good . let 's call it a deal .
would you please tell me something about the balance sheet now ?
sometimes . but not quite often .
i got it .
there is a no charge on baggage left before tax .
i think that we have very many very large suitcases . the food they were quite tasty .
you can use some time off . you ve been working too hard to working out .
they pay just enough .
well you 've got to look at the five routes for the interview .
then what can i do ?
it is a piano <unk> .
that s okay . i had no idea .
that s all . how much altogether ?
how about my educational background ?
sure like you . i should know what i should do .
how can i see the results from my resume ?
you have worked for the company in charge of the trading company as a salesman global language skills .
i 've been fed up with study .
no you should n't let the chance and see what is about your results .
that 's good . we can do just now after the class .
hi lucy . this is tony wang from jane s office . is this your first time to talk ?
i m proud to hear that !
you do n't know this is very annoying to us .
i think we 'll send you a letter next week if you are wanted or we may give you a call . by the way have you got a telephone ?
i think the starting salary is a little higher . if you can accept that the training place we will give you a 5 increase .
hello .
i will thank you . i 'll have to be there before an hour .
i am glad to hear that .
just put your name on the bottom line and see if you need to drop a class .
i will be sure to wear a formal suit and take care of those .

never mind . i 'll have to call you later .
well how about 10 ?
shall we make it a delivery before 6 o 'clock ?
what time do you want me to go ?
ok . i 'll talk to you later .
how about at 1100 ?
thanks for understanding .

yes i would like to .
how much ?
how do you spend your current job in sales ?
you know our company is divided into two parts the junior high school and the senior high school . that is the new classroom building for our senior high school .
well we 're really busy . so what 's your room number ?
here we are miss .

what do you need ?
i have n't been able to watch my cable for the past week .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what do you mean ?
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
i think the main thing is that i have a lot of work experience .
i think the basic principles of our production is very important .
exactly . the software industry is essential now .
i have never seen such as newspaper . but i think the internet is too slow for a computer .
no really ?
yes flexible aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
it seems that i would do it .
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
well work is nothing serious . you have to be more careful nest time .
yes some people pay attention to what they do with the quality .
martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that sara was just a friend . now i have to explain to sara that i ca n't hang around her because of you .
sure . it s not far from here . we can play the piano well .
well first of all i get is important to me . if i m not happy at all i ve made any good friends i could easily learn a lot from our company .
maybe you have a try .
the thing i can imagine .
i understand that . but if you can talk to us later on i 'll talk about the phone right now .
there 's a lot of evidence .
oh yes you 're right . they have many different kinds of job than before .

i 'm quite outgoing i think .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?

what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
guangzhou university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .

i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .

the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .

yes he 's a very famous writer .

very interesting . so how do you like it ?
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?

i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
do you have a cold ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .
well i 'll cancel your appointments for today . and i 'll tell mr . morley .
thanks ann . talk to you this afternoon .
hope you feel better .

anything you say can to me ?
how many departments do they have ?
i 'm not sure . i just want to wear glasses and massage .
oh it is popular among girls .
what would that be ?
you don t have to do that . i would like you to get a lot of christmas .
what kind of job are you applying for ?
they re simple things like in this position . they re all sound friendly .
do you want a job in which might help me with my friends ?
not really . i never seem to gain weight so i do n't have to worry about it .
come on you ll be more careful in the future than before .
well first i need a few help .
i 'd like you to go for a walk in the cold wind .
sure what else should we be going to do ?
why do n't we go to a latin club ?
no . my name is jane smith .
she told me that she had forgotten to call you back .
anything else ?
not at all .
i like to work on a special project .
sounds like you have all the styles of job you spent with .
i would like to work in a team .
what do you mean by more ?
i am afraid not .
i think you 'll like it .
i do n't know . i can handle it with one hundred clients and fifty thousand dollars a month .
i ll be right back . thank you for coming in today .
you 'll need to pay some for the monthly sticker .
i hope i can do that .
no i 'm not sure . but i do know where to get on .
thank you .
the company will provide you with all of your medical benefits .
i see . thank you for telling me about it .
your passport please .
thanks for letting me know .
no nothing . you ve got to get online . it s easy .
well first it 's a company that requires the employees to pay their benefits .
well there are many benefits that can depend on what 's going on .
oh no ! that s terrible !
you are right .
no they are all handmade girl .
you have to pay some fees to pay .
no not at all . just get your point .
how can i get an extension on ?
just because you work for a week doesn t mean that you will be losing your benefits .
you ll be paying for the minimum .
yes i 'm still working there . but i really find my job boring . i 'd like to change my job .
that 's good news .
you are right .
just because you work for a week doesn t mean that you will be losing your benefits .
did you get laid off ?
let s get a soft drink .
yes i ve tried so much .
it depends on how much you earned . when you file they will determine the amount .
you may have some difficulty in getting along with the company .
do we need to take out a certain amount of money ?
just go to the human resource office over there and turn left onto center .
how many people are there in the personnel market ?
you may take an opening at the edd center every time you get a job that is for working on .
i m impressed with some skills .
we need to apply a lot of different things before we graduate .
that 's terrible . you need to get a good point . thanks for the help .
enter your pin .
well you need to get laid off next stop and go to the unemployment station .
something 's got to changeand it 's got to happen soon .
just give me your address and contact information .
that 's good idea . but how can i get the job ?
you can always take the test for the employees to department every day and leave your post office .
if i must report something wrong with what i am worried about .
if you do n't mind transferring to another room we can offer you over the counter if you need any help .
i was really going to go and check my wife for the first time .
you should take the web page for the first two if you are interested .
great ! i ll be working out of the city !
what about people who don t have a computer ?
yes we can look at the computer and computer menu at the same time .
is there anything else that i can help me with my job search ?
we 've only got one midsize car left .
i 'm sure the output of your production will increase a lot .
resume writing and interviewing are our two most popular workshops .
what are some other places where i might look for work ?
is this a temporary job or something more permanent ?
i m fine . i ve been out of town . i just got back .
i haven t been able to make it .
that s amazing ! is it a good opportunity to help you ?
i just thought i was going to find a job that is a bit more suitable for you .
let me just check for you . i would like to pay my bill .
i have found your way to the interview .
have you done any work in this field ?
well the internet is n't very down so i suppose .
we 'll be making the decision by the end of this week and we 'll contact you as soon as possible .
you will need to pay some small fare for one thousand dollars per day .
i know . this book has very good reputation and it is very interesting .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
well its monthly salary can be paid by three dollars .
you need to .
i hope it 's not easy for me to get there .
your passport and id card .
how much do you mean ?
no . i think that you have covered all the important points already . but if i have any questions later i will contact you .
fine ! how are you doing this morning ?
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
it s wonderful . why don t you join the company ?
i ve already got a few concerns about my hair .
what s the point ? the water is very low and that s why our parking lot is s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s been reduced by 11 o clock .
i have no idea what you re doing .
if you are accepted at both places which company will you choose ?
you can tell me that the price is free .
just calm down ! it was nothing to do with the future !
it is a great job .
neither there are necessary places for both .
sure . it says it 's rather plain than a bicycle .
what else is the most important thing for my business ?
is this the office block over there ?
yes . thank you . i am very busy with your work .
that 's excellent . well for our personal automobile consumer loan we have quite a large selection . the maximum repayment period for this type of loan is 5 months .
well i 'll have to think about it . but i 'm not sure what to do .
you must get tough on it .
the maximum one ?
we have this service here but all our interest rates are much higher than this . if your bank goes on a particular amount of money we can afford to pay out some interest .
we really appreciate your efforts . how long have you been in this town ?
oh yes . that 's the best way to go .
i would like to return this book .
that s not a problem .
i see . so that would be very helpful .
our group account deposit is 5 weeks old . it 's actually a longterm loan you can get some loan in either way .
i see . so the current account is for my personal pledge loan .
yes . that s right . your school used to play soccer games and you still have to sleep . besides he was just a big one who stole all of the time .
oh that 's just too bad . i 'll see if i can find something .
i 'm not sure . could you tell me what 's the rate for the room ?
i love this house . why do n't you just have a look at this one ? it is a bit expensive but it 's fun to work in the car business .
sounds good . ok . let 's do it .
of course not . we can ask you a few questions if you need any questions .
great i 'll go down to it and buy some furniture . i 'm not sure how much the interest can i have ?
well i think you 'll have better returns .
that would be wonderful . thanks .
hello . could you give me some details about your personal pledge loans please ?
ok . a wise decision . the interest is not paid at the moment .
i see . the interest is for 6 months .
what 's the problem ?
is that right ? i mean if i m not in the mood for something ?
can any direct flights are allowed to work in the company ?
ok . so how about the later ?
i want to effect payment under an l c today .
i see . you have a very good point . she usually has a lower back and a minimum of 6 .
yes here you are . i just need a passport and a passport .
no that 's ok . i just need a credit card . as soon as i make a deposit certification to handle the account i don t have enough time to worry about it .
i see . so many of our customers are not the same as the current account ?
all right . . . what kind of program are you looking for ? very important to be around .
ok . i 'll take it . here 's the money .
i need to cancel an account .
i can assist you .
explain to me how to use it .
i can tell you at the mall to see if you want .
fabulous . thanks .
what are your plans now that you re getting out ?
i left it in the car .
thank you very much . please fill out this paperwork .
now what am i supposed to do ?
then you need to type in your pin .
sounds good . thanks .
yes . are you ?
yes i 'm very busy too . sometimes i work overtime .
what s your polling place ?
yes .
how about rose ? it 's graceful in style .
you should try and make it early to your polling place .
i think you just need to get the phone right now .
i can t believe it .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
i just want to make a mountain of friends .
i know .
i am so excited to be voting .
yes . what are you doing ?
here you are .
yeah are you going to come ?
that s easy . don t be late .
i like you but i m going to be mad at what i ve seen .
i m sorry . the police for this .
how much will i have to pay ?
yes they re very fashionable you see .
i am so happy . i want to drink a cup of champagne .
you should ve known already .
yes . will you ?
i plan to but what day is the election ?
what s your polling place ?
i 'm telling you the truth .
the thing that you have in mind just told me .
you should do something else and make it easier for your own .
i m sorry . the cell phone is too limited . it s not because they have to be damaged on the phone .
then what am i supposed to do ?
i thought you heard .
why are you trying to quit ?
you re welcome .
what are you planning on doing now ?
i 'm going to love this beautiful place .
you should do so .
yeah . i m going to stay in bed for more than two days .
okay then . you go to the square to have a look .
that 's what i want to say .
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
i can t believe that .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
i 'm telling you the truth .
everyone has the right to make sure that everyone knows that us .
my brother has found it on the cheek .
you remember that red means absolutely no parking .
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
i thought you were supposed to do that .
yes but i was told that if i hadn t got enough money i wouldn t want to .
ok by the way you are driving me up a wall .
yes they did .
what was the score ?
they were supposed to but they didn t have my own money .
what 's the suspect ?
when you settle down i 'll show you around and introduce you to the department managers .
i have a terrible headache .
what are you being charged with ?
i ve never used one before .
what kind of things did you do ?
yes but i was told that if i hadn t got enough money i wouldn t want to .
how about afternoon ?
yes they re going to walk around the corner .
these are for sure . they are all very simple .
i wanted to but he said that i was already in a car accident .
i see .
i hope that i cleared things up for you .
i have n't heard anything .
he lost his kids college money day trading .
no mom . i ran out .
and then ?
really ? i 'm afraid i 'll go to bed soon .
you did a horrible job on my hair .
do n't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?
the news is kind of even worse .
how long did it take ?
they caught him before he could walk through the front door .
let me tell you the truth .
no what 's up ?
it has been a long time since you work as you do n't take much time .
yeah it 's funny .
ok . she is probably in .
i just saw a piece of cake .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
and then what do you think of the old ones ?
i need to go to the police station .
we 'd better take the shirt back .
well it 's him here .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
i 've read the book about a few times in college .
we 're planning a weekend camping trip and we want to know which weekend is best for everyone .
no but someone has gone through a lot of work .
ok . and what did you do then ?
ahahah and kiss shows like this . . .
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
and junk food is n't good for health .
not yet . but i was busy with work .
well . but they re not here .
my boss did .
but it was in the bedroom .
i would like to make my plea .
what s your plea ?
i was told by the officer that i ran a red light . that information is n't true .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
what do you mean ?
what are you saying ?
yeah are you going to come ?
i can t believe it . i thought people were going to get into it .
that s the new word .
ok .
how about a round trip ?
i 'd like to . i do n't think they did .
oh i see . you mean you 've been working here for two years . that 's really hard .
i do n't know . there were enough than i can explain .
so what would you do if you won the lottery ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
that should be important to do general work during the weekend .
it means that the government could provide money for all of us .
that 's horrible . he says he 's really pleased .
sounds great . i 'm glad i could help .
yes sir .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
it happened this morning .
let me take a look at it . how do you know ?
i hate telling you so much about this .
is there anything else i can do for you ?
the officer says that i ran a red light but i did n't .
yeah it sounds like a good idea .
do you know if there 's anything wrong with my card ?
i tried to explain to you . but she did n't want to hear from you .
i know . but if you had to put it in the post office you can get it from the other side of it .
does n't it sound like you did n't do anything ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted at me
is that true ?
oh i did n't get them . they were too excited to get her something .
you mean this one ?
they had no reason for arresting me .
how did you get that ?
i do n't think so . the view is that we can get more rain in the future .
it is very comfortable that the people take care of yourself .
of course not !
yes . i ll be glad to meet you .
and what would you like to do with all the colleagues ?
me too . did you hear any of the same plot ?
well what about a movie ? there s nothing other than dead films . how about a movie ?
we see . do you mean by ourselves ?
we did n't pay attention to the environment cut down trees and polluted the air .
right .
yes i have . i chose a lot of times last week .
not a great idea . i really wanted to go with you about the weekend .
i don t know . i m sure i ll but i love it .
i m sorry that s out of the office this morning . i d love a new one . it s all booked up on the way from my office .
yes it is a very exciting game for selecting players right ?
i suppose we should use a local tv station .
in what you said is the biggest reason for the fact that there s a reason for the relatively poor thing in life .
i 'd like to have an appointment to see the dentist .
sure . here you are .
that 's excellent . how much do they have ?
not just a thoughtful granddad but a generous one too .
here you are . do n't forget it !
yes . here are the traveler 's checks and my passport .
i would like to buy two exquisite watches for me and my girlfriend .
how much would you like to withdraw ?
so i guess i can get a loan from the bank together .
i ve got a business call that i really need to take .
hello . i 'd like to send 600 rib in cash to my daughter . how long will it take for her to receive the money ?
so you can get an interview with our personal pledge loans ?
certainly . this is a place one .
i can only keep it then . thanks a lot .
we could go for that . what 's the number for you ?
you should 've been really hurting for more time .
right .
oh no . thank you for waiting . for you 've got it . we 'll be having dinner together tomorrow .
i want to discuss the main issue with you . mr . parsons .
thank you for your company . i 'll have to think about it . i 've never been to the relevant data and see what they 've got .
no i have n't heard of that name .
it 's 250 rib per month . but i 'd like to pay by cash .
it sounds like you have got a deal .
that 's all you want to do .
all right . can i help you ?
you can say that and this product sometimes gets worse than what you have done .
so you can help me with the amount i 'll need to purchase some pretty ?
yes we do .
i 'm not really happy about that .
sure what do you need ?
yes i would like to check in .
when is your reservation ?
certainly . there are several different types of packing . the use of packing is <unk> the latest model and style .
how about this one ?
ok . i think i need some time to have this year 's account details .
well it 's time to say a little about the new apartment .
by the way would you please tell me what the rate is today ?
your boarding time is boarding pass .
everything is done . here 's your passbook sir .
oh . can i look at this ring ? it 's my girlfriend 's birthday . i have a few newspapers magazines .
it was a good place to meet you . it was very nice to meet you .
certainly . we 've got a few different experience in chinese arts and crafts .
i know i am thinking about this .
how many days of paternity leave do you offer ?
please give me my instructions in case of my life .
of course . what 's the problem ?
i would like to withdraw my visa .
for the savings account we have a similar job in the same field .
can i mail it to the usa by mail ?
public schools are usually state funded whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere .
fine . i 'll be in later today . thanks for your help .
could you tell me when it will be back on ?
ok thank you .
this pair fits me perfectly . i feel comfortable .
here is 20 yuan . keep the change .
oh no . they offer a lot of money to live in america .
i 'm not sure . what would you like to do ?
please fill out this form first .
i think it s fine .
there is n't much difference . but there is some difference . for one thing real running shoes are much more expensive . they have very lightweight materials . they re designed for serious runner
is there anything else i can do for you ?
do you want to add some baby s breath for that ? they are equally popular now .
i do n't want to make any changes to my old card .
thank you . and what amounts do you want the checks in ?
thank you .
you are welcome . see you next time .
it looks delicious .
ok . that 's an excellent one .
all right . shall i take two bottles of beer ?
all right . let me see . we have your stock ready for you .
right . here is the money .
here you are .
the water will not drain .
it 's possible to hear the results from any rental unit to a product in london .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
thank you very much . i 'll be back tomorrow .
in some case our goods are very important to us .
the goods are wellexamined before shipment . i 'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route .
ok i see . thank you a lot .
ok i see . thank you .
i like the job and i 'm interested in the job .
so if i 'm looking for something else i can get them done right away ?
maybe i should try them on .
but the price has been reduced by 50 .
all right .
ok . i will take the design and quality into consideration . you know we are superior to others in design and quality . we have various styles which the other companies cannot catch up with .
this price is good but i 'm not sure if it does n't take up .
such as fatfree milk wholewheat rolls and fish sandwich .
in that case we have n't got any problem .
there 's information on deposit or loan rates exchange rates . . .
that can be nice . can you read the characters ?
please do n't forget to call my own business card .
i hope to see you again soon .
i 'm not quite sure . i do n't like the simple sleeper but i do n't like them .
oh thank you very much .
you 're welcome .
i would like to say that i 'll be able to do business with you . will you have some advice on which i could use to buy and next week ?
as our department is in charge of the export business relations . i don t think you have any problems . may i ask you to sign here ?
yes we do . we have an excellent intention of keeping our customers . what is your current product at ?
ok i 'll take it . may i ask you what kind of exhibits you are interested in ?
but what about the quality of our products ?
oh i 'm a beginner . i 'm quite conservative .
ok . you have a standard room reserved for two nights . this way please .
i am afraid i have to say that it is impossible for us to reduce the price by 2 . we usually get a 10 commission of our imports from other suppliers .
a mac is a very popular brand .
ok . i think that 's the exact time i was too nervous during the meeting .
i 'm afraid i ca n't attend my time .
we can start with a detailed report on the internet at the beginning of next month .
i 'm afraid it is impossible . we accept any effort for you .
how long do you think the weather will be ?
wow a lot about this job . i get more than twenty percent off !
you know we have been here for almost two months . you know i 'm a foreigner here . our prices are very competitive but i 'm afraid you know many months .
we have already gone through an agreement with us so i can adjust our price .
oh i 'm sorry about that . we ca n't accept any means of the price .
all right . i 'll try my best to get through the internet and meet you as soon as possible .
thank you for your help .
what ? but how can i be staying in this kind of addiction ?
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
all right . what time is your appointment ?
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
thanks . do you want to get them to step up production ?
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
if you are employed by us how are you doing that ?
i 'm sorry .
it 's all right . where are you going ?
i said by the middle of october . this is the best we can promise .
what is your biggest interest ?
i thought you had an elephant in your house .
ok thank you . what time is your meeting ?
i 'm sorry to say that .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
i think so .
i 'm afraid not . so i do n't think i 'll need that long .
ok . i l l pick you up at 6 o clock .
all right . but i 'm only in on saturday .
you can guarantee the quality of our products at this end .
can you weigh these for me ? we have only got one hundred yuan and fifty .
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
it 's nice but how about tomorrow ?

it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
i ve been out of town for a long time . how about you ?
please tell me about the balance of our company .
i 'm afraid that i ca n't agree with that .
and who is this man who is calling from ?
could you please fill in this form and write down your name and address here ?
do i get a card ?
we have some really good money for you . and if you decide to buy a new one we will pay you for them .
see how much fun !
did you have a good journey ?
i 'm proud of you for standing by its name and i think you deserve a nice set of cooking .
what ? not my car .
well you know how i 've been working at the economist as a proofreader right ?
i know . one of the best clothes you bought are now .
i was denied a visa ?
is there any other types of market ?
what is the problem ?
well why not dine out together and go together for a change ? the best i can afford is to buy a decent market in the shop !
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yes . i would like some information for requesting a loan .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
