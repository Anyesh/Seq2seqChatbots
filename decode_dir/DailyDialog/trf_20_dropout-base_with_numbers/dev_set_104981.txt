i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .

how far is it ?
you 're welcome .
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?

i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?

that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that 'll be going overboard a bit .
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing .
that s even better than the real thing .

yes of course . i have to buy some things at the mall near the exit .
we need to do something about it . there are several interesting ones for rather than 3 days .

yes .
thank you sir . just a moment please .

stirred or shaken ?
stirred will be fine .
here you are .

how do they make it ?
are you kidding me ?
they are good . they 're delicious .
i would like to have the coffee rum pies .
i guess so .
none of the party has just started .
i 'd like to order a bottle of champagne lobster tail and filet mignon medium rare .
i never thought about that .
you can get the basics or an international one .
blah . . . what 's that ?
no problem . i ll go get it right away .
what do you mean by that ?
you 're welcome .
it 's really great . did you cook it ?
well i think you can make a decision .
that does n't sound nice . i think i 'll try it .
i 'm not exactly sure . it 's a tradition in chinese food . here 's the same services with my daily family .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
um this steak i asked for to be medium rare .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
she is a famous woman in my class .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
what did you do ?
we have to write you a ticket and <unk> your vehicle .
one moment . do you want to withdraw some cash while you 're at it ?
can you spell that please ?
all right . but let me take a look at the final review .
tell me what you want to do .
are you scared of anything ?
would you mind telling me what the order are for ?
what are you going to do ?
may i know what you do ?
so then why do n't you drive it ?
can i get you another pet ?
i ve only been to the states that it is kind of you .
oh you mean we can make a bet on our own .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
you 're right . i promise .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
why ?
about 18 .
ok . i 'll take the next train .
yeah i know . why do n't we go ?
no . not anymore .
so you ca n't miss it . what 's your next time ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
well i 'm afraid it 's too late . we will have to improve your request .
there 's quite a long list actually ! you can use if for business trip expenses medical expenses any internal payments .
ok i will look at your kitchen before you come back .
would you like a home near the lake ?
i 'm glad to hear that . she is pretty but i know her .
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's only about 10 minutes walk .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
all right .
this is mr . smith in our office . i have just got some urgent documents and these are already included in some time .

i learned to negotiate 9 from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at kimble s department store .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at <unk> s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .
um huh ? why ?

i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen s boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
well you can ask the nearby department and see if you can tell me the nearby .
actually a friend of a shop i had a friend and they had a dog .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
sure . according to the exchange rate every month in cash is equivalent to 0 . 75 dollars .
no it 's not necessary . the only thing is to be on the bus .
what do i do with it ?
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .

you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
have you seen anything else ?
how about oil or spray ?

you can buy them either ripe or unripe . unripe ones are hard .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
i m in let me know .

i 'll do my best .
i 'm completely lost . i 'm trying to find the way to my daughter 's home .
it 's about 300 pounds .
oh i see .
please fill out the form .
yes i do .
hello madam . where to ?
a new car .
really ? i will take it .
i 'm completely lost . i 'm trying to buy some books now .
3 dollars .
here 's 20 yuan keep the change .
it is at the north of forbidden city on the central axis of beijing .
will you be long ?
that comes to four dollars and ten cents .
why are you applying for a job ?
thank you .
hi lucy are you free to talk ?
yeah you 're right .
thank you . where should i send your final phone bill ?
yes i 'm afraid i 've got the wrong extension .
how many do you want ?
see you later .
see you then .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello todd !
wow ! what a wonderful day ! i have n't seen you for a long time .
it was it there at the beginning of the meeting .
i 'm fine thanks . how about you ?
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
well then what 's your problem ?
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
ok ! take it easy .
thank you .
do n't you hit it off ?
about two years now .
right .
i 've told him that he 's an excellent team player and the boss never buys anything . he loves his wife .
what does your sister think of gold ?
oh no . during the day tour we had a great time together .
that 's a great idea . he used to be quite a <unk> . i thought he was being a little disappointed .
what time is he at ?
thank you .
i 'll be there .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
no you do n't ! the car s red and the floor is about to take your driver s license .
what do you think i can do ! you can t just kiss me then go for second base !
yeah ! we ve been here for a while already ! i think you ve got a fever and a bad cough . let s go !
what 's the fire under ?
ok ! i ve got a fever and run now that i can t get a cold or a little .
just surfing ?
some of my friends play cards on the internet .
there are some problems in my computer . i just had to take a look at it and put it in the process .
i m looking for a sweater .
are you looking for anything ?
i d prefer a first class . how much is that ?
what s your camera ?
actually i think the additional premium for the american minority students have the certificate .
sure i do . go to the bank together .
thank you .
so what kind of demands do you like ?
a nice holiday to see you again . how about some sun ?
ok . i don t think i can afford that .
and no hijackers .
ok . i don t want to buy that newspaper .
what is it formal ?
sure . glad to hear it .
someone told me it was a bit chilly outside .
that s what my computer is showing .
i like that .
no problem anytime .
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no no no no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
no . thank you . i think it 's enough for dinner .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to return this book .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes .
no way ! i m really sorry !
it is ok to come in please .
forget it . it s not the cleaner s responsibility to pick up after lazy people . you can learn a lot from the campus .
good news !
it is a little more expensive sir .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
what size do you wear ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's a lot of traffic . there 's no hot water after 10 at night . sometimes it takes about one hour . many people have to stay in bed for two days .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
the kitchen and refrigerator are messed up with the bedroom .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
maybe we could get some new furniture . better stuff .
i have n't thought of that .
yes it has two bedrooms . that 's convenient .
can i interest you in an interview ?
the rent is 1050 every month .
that s way too much .
what s the most important thing .
what ?
let me see . that s five dollars .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you please reconsider ?
i think a chinese student <unk> on written english and uses it as a basis for communicating . from start to finish he s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . this is a very difficult way to learn .
i m not interested in that .
i love it . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . it gives me a real sense of satisfaction . do you enjoy cooking ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah . i find it difficult to find products online . it takes a long time to make money from my home .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
very well . do you want your suit ?
i 'll take one made of wool sweater .
the brown one is nice .
you ca n't go down on the price .
there s no doubt that it s about impossible to find such a cheaper one .
well i just got back from the department . it s too noisy for me .
i see . then you can buy them as a suit .
the red one is nice . what 's the price of the hardcover ?
the streets are heavy with traffic at the knees .
the brown one .
they re awesome .
i ve got to do that .
yeah you 're speaking . how can i help you ?
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
yes it 's still vacant .
i am not sure .
i love it on the balcony . you can go to the top of the eiffel tower .
good . i will see you then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
yes i want to go to the mall . can you make a left ?
you 're welcome .
ok .
no but if you can think of anything else just get it .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
but the price has been reduced by 50 . it s a real bargain .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it has two bedrooms . that 's convenient .
right this time has been a pleasure working with you .
i think you ll find it soon .
with so few windows how can you even see what the problems are ?
do you have a balcony ?
it s quite interesting .
the best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom .
i do n't think it is too bright .
three . besides my parents and me there are my brother and sister .
great ! the market is now a little different from what i am looking for .
now that you put the dishes on the sand .
in the meantime is i still under the seat ?
sure .
it 's a pity we can go around the nanjing road .
wow ! this place is so beautiful . i love the design and the design .
i thought it might rain .
thank you .
that s what i m looking for .
i 'm sorry . he 's out in a meeting now . could i ask who is calling ?
hello i 'm calling to see if you have made your decision . you are the right person we are seeking for .
do you see the apartment ?
i 'd love to live with you on a job if you can think of something .
how about tomorrow at the very latest ?
i appreciate it very much .
we ca n't come back until tomorrow .
ok i 'll see you then .
we have more rooms available .
should i bring anything with me ?
no but if you can think of anything else just get it .
yes i 'd like to have a look at the 2 piece suit .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
okay thank you for your instruction .
yes .
how many do you want ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
i m not kidding .
how many do you want ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
oh i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
do you know what your short already sells ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
i 'm just coming . it 's my pleasure doing business with you .
not exactly . the coffee i had with the d and a cup of coffee .
well i 'm going to like your deck .
it 's hard to say . just a little tight .
what style do you want ?
i 'm not sure about that . i think i 'll wear a very attractive one .
i think that the best job is to be a clerk of your company .
no i 'm afraid not . you can take it to the station . it is always hard to find a boarding pass .
it 's time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
to the right .
how many do you want ?
no just that 's all right . i 'll just go and check my connections .
i see . do you have any allergies ?
that 's pretty nice .
it 's <unk> .
oh that 's nice of you .
yes . if you need anything just call it free .
the <unk> is many pictures . you can see that each side is the kind of packing .
all right . i think you 've got it .
let 's see .
i know what you mean . i am thinking of getting a newspaper to do .
so what am i going to do ?
where is the place ?
i will go check out the kitchen next .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
ok let 's go check the kitchen next .
yes it does . we do have a lot of improvement in a oil and some fish .
yes they do .
where is it ?
how long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?
where is the place ?
it s that the good idea to have a lot of money in taiwan .
where is it ?

i guess we should send someone to fix it . maybe we can get back to work on time .
sorry but there are no more than those .
alright . and what is your name ?
you 're welcome .
it 's a big difference .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
the company deals in selling electronics .
you mean i should make an offer on fob basis .
thanks . what time do you leave ?
the usual things in canada .
well you know i have to decide if i can get a few things like that .
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
but i want to get a pair of expensive shoes .
i 'm afraid i ca n't sir .
it 's a great place to do some shopping .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
yes but i heard that the company is selling like <unk> or baby at the other day . looking at the headlines take the newspaper . .
yes . but he is a little bit nervous . what if a terrible boy and then he went to hospital .
do you have any ideas ?
let me see . . . i 'm not sure what 's your rate today .
how much do you think they 're going to cost ?
well we can go to the bank together .
yes i 'm looking for a job as a clerk typist in english .

i 'll take the student bus .
can you give me a rough idea ?
my husband and i are planning to leave a car in the afternoon . would you like to have one ?
oh i see . but it is my pleasure .
i 'm afraid we cannot help you sir . we have quotation for the prices you are too long .
i think that the apartment is very nice .
i 'm glad to hear that . you see i 'm in a position to say something about your new car .
here you are .
thank you . please fill out this paperwork .
well . we do n't have enough cash to be here .
when will you be convenient ?
sure what do you want to know ?
i am disappointed with your work lately .
do i have to try that restaurant that do you think of ever one ?
is it very cold in your city ?
anything else ?
have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?
i do n't think so . as long as the fish is high enough to keep healthy .
i know what you mean . a few people would teach me how to do that .
what ? you ve been in the kitchen before ! oh ! it s not the first thing to do !
you know i am trying to turn off the shower and i can just use the chicken !
how about the jeans ? they look very graceful in style .
it 's not just for the compliment .
no i did n't think that 's why i did n't like them .
yes i am sure we can . but we need to do something different .
yes i do it a lot .
that 's really a great suggestion ! i m really happy for you !
i usually try my best to make dinner .
yeah i m going to start cooking if you are not good at doing as well . i ll also have to set up some weight for your food .
really ? how about my hand carry out the food ?
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like .
mainly plastics . they stand at least one hundred and twenty minutes of break downs and isn t break . most of them are important to me . i don t like doing better than five times .
we have many cookies left here . what about some lamb ?
i think america is an interesting combination of fast food . people usually try to find out something more cultural so we must try to get more and more food .
yeah we could do something about drink .
i 've never tasted anything better .
yes . i ve always been buying indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . the food is difficult to make curries now but i still have n't finished eating properly at all .
my absolutely favorite is to eat something special .

i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i think i will try that .
yeah why not . i have to go shopping the other day i 'm not going to spend all the junk food every day .
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
yes . i have a reservation for a single room with us on the 12th .
i do n't have any idea what to cook .

i have had one for another week .
o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room sir ?
every so often .
you have your own vehicle ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
do you want one ?
it 's too expensive for me to do that .
okay . do you want me to give you a ride ?
we can get both at the cafeteria .
what about a gila monster ?
oh come on baby . it 's already ten minutes late .
but give yourself some time . you just got here .

it 's true . the pain is just as simple as it is .
all right i will explain it to you later on . now scram .
b what do you want to say ?
i know but we have to wait for the next bus .
this was my honor .
i do n't think so .
my paper is on the influence of television on children .
what 's your occupation ?
what 's your greatest strength ?
what can i do for you ?
nothing thanks . i 'm just a little tired .
i am sorry sir . we will send our staff right now .
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
you see . i think i don t want to hear of this ?
i have no idea what .
i think this is the right way . why do n't we go for the police ?
i think i want to try a new style .
how so ?
i have been studying . i 'm learning english now .
i know how you feel . i 'm sure you can do well .
i have n't made up my mind . i just want to go somewhere with my parents .
how many do you want ?
the next class will be next monday .
i like business management and i think the best way i 'm good at stewing beef .
what other kind of food do you like ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
well it s my job .
what ?
the food station was as crowded as usual . i waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich and when i finally got it the chicken was underdone .
it 's not the only chance to improve your english .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
well i think you 'll enjoy it .
can you help me do anything ?
i 'm fine thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it 's hard to keep track of everything around here .
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
well i 'm an english major you know . so i came here to make a small study .
i 'm not really sure .
i see . but i 'm going to be a lawyer for one year and i 'm not sure you ll have to experience this month .
i know . i 'll do it .
see you .
yes she certainly has . what about you ?
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
thanks professor . i think i 'm doing well at the moment .
i have to work .
i have been doing the same exercises at home because i 'm not very familiar with the others in the same subject .
certainly . after you have your course you can get your course again .
i think so . i am not really lucky about this .
that 's ok .
i am worried about the meeting this morning .
do n't worry . i 'll help you get out of the bookstore .
i see .
i have to work .
ok i see . where can i find a money for them ?
generally speaking english is a general language . in my opinion english is the ability to solve the main course and technology . the law is a tool to connect with people and the stigma of meeting someone who is advertising for people .
i really do n't know . i think the rent is just too big for me .
it 's on the second floor . may i have a look at the menu ?
how long will the tour take me to get there ?
me too .
that would be very interesting . so many people hope to survive . but those in traditional years have become used for long lived in australia .
is it a good school ?
i 'll go and find a pair of books and then i 'll go back to chicago .
you re going to take courses ?
no i 'm going to take some courses there .
what do you consider your major in the computer ?
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
i think i 'm convinced that you believe me .
i just want to get a little alone . i 'll have to work on it .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
of course . it 's on memorial avenue .
that sounds pretty good . and how do i get to the consulting room ?
you can check out two books at a time .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
for two weeks . after that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer .
ok . thank you very much for your advice .
certainly . if you do n't mind coming along with me i 'll always take a course .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon . can you tell me how to get there ?
you 're welcome .
my name is james .
my name is sam .
nice to meet you too .
yes it 's nice to meet you too . and you ?
can i help you get ready ?
may i ask you for your ticket ?
that depends on what you want . how much is it ?
is that right ? wonderful . i 've been in king dao for two years now . a great place . nice people and great beer ! well i guess we d better get started .
why ?
i am going to visit my sister in the city .
so he 's really young . he 's a great guy .
will you be able to make it ?
really ? but you could have been more careful .
oh thank you . i 'm going to visit great wall . i really have n't heard of it .
it 's a pleasure to do business with you .
i was n't able to attend the class on tuesday .
good .
i 'm going to need some classes .
what do i need to do to prepare for a meeting ?
it is not easy to learn .
you 're just a quick learner .
i 'm going to take a driver 's course .
all right . what kind of drink do you want ?
i see . have you ever had any experience as a teacher ?
yes sir . well in fact we have a variety of things things that could add you a business or if you want please take a break !
is that what you said ?
no he is . he s whiter than the chinese kids and his hair is a little blonde . my husband says his eyes are very good .
he was really upset .
i have my book from class here .
good . i 'll pick you up at about eight o 'clock .
i took a parttime job last semester in translating and doing reception work for an exhibition . my work included hosting the visiting foreign exhibitors communicating with them arranging their agenda and translating several materials . i think this activity well demonstrated my ability in english . and i will be glad to take any form of english test you arrange for me to prove my ability .
you 're really a tight schedule .
oh yes that 's in what you said when i get chinese .
i do n't think i can find anything else for you .
i took a parttime job in college so i took many pictures .
is n't it a bit bad ?

not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
what do you mean ?
you are kidding . that 's the heart of lake .
no it is not mine .
well i 'll see . sometimes the stores do n't have some of the new kinds of cereal .
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i am worried .
what about ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
oh is that all ?
i feel very nervous about it .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i 'm planning to go to the university of ohio in america .
i understand . you re quite right now that you wouldn t be able to make it without you .
do you have any breaks ?
oh i remember a lot about it . to me the lamb was difficult with the food was difficult to overcome my job . i am always happy to overcome my food .
what ? what do you mean ?
i think it s reasonable .
what ?
that s good service . well what am i going to do ?
i think you re right . i think chinese is more difficult than english .
ok so you are really a good cook your wife .
very well . thank you .
what can i do for you today ?
i need to get a passport .
what do you need me to do ?
do you know how to turn them on ?
did you check the periodicals ?
i didn t even bother to think of that .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
i see .
would you like me to make sure that you are interested in ?
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
this is the kitchen . . . hey ! i ve never been here a year before .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
did you go to the top of the eiffel tower ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to cancel one of my accounts .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
great . can i take it with me now ? or do you need me to fill in some forms or something ?
how much is the late fee ?
yes .
you re not sure ?
i want to transfer 200 .

yes i do .
what classes did you want to sign up for ?
wait a second . i think you 've made a decision .
i 'll be free from two until four what time works out best ?
i 'm not sure yet . if it 's a little late i 'll try to go to sleep . besides i do n't want to miss the beach .
many people are striving for going out tonight . it seems to be a trend .
i think we are here at the moment .
when you cross the quad the office is right in front of you . go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .
yeah you 're nearly ready . the beer are kind of cold .
thanks a lot .

here you are .
no i m not sure .

i 'm very sorry mr . bob . there has been a mistake . we 'll correct the bill .
here 's a twenty .
i think it 's much too complicated . here is the form and the receipt . the change to a friend 's address .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
what do you think the problem is that you are already a good base .
no i think she 's being charged in four months .
no problem . can i have your money please ?
can you tell me how it works ?
i 'll pick you up at . . . say seven o 'clock ?
i have no idea . i 'm not sure if i can pass the course .
may i try it on ?
ok but you know our company is a big child and not far away .
after all we have to go to the park .
it 's ok . is there anything else i should do before the meeting ?
yes it is .
that sounds like a good idea .
i do n't think
could i see both of them ?
no i think it is ok .
i 'll have a taxi for you momentarily sir .
i 'll go and get it .
they 're due back next week .
yes . we would win the game .
all right . well i 'll see you later .
then we 'll follow it to the bottom of the hill .
but thank you very much all the same .
of course not . my family has a lot of history . they have about forty years in the life .
in fact there are many schools and spanish in almost all .
my major is a computer science fiction writer .
i still think nobody will see anything .
it 's a quarter to 12 . i think it 's time to get used to my car .
so it 's really a good feeling . i ca n't keep my jacket .
how about a china vase ?
i can do that right now .
well we will get a raise from the workers to work . and go to work on sunday .
i was in the law school in harvard university .
do n't forget to take the test again .
yeah .
thanks a lot . how much do i have to pay ?
i think the most important thing is you should make ends meet . i m sure the same thing is that i like doing now is what i do . if i follow your goals and how to use these things . i think they will fit the company 's just be paid more attention to the fair .
so it 's really the same story . i 'm not ready for my job .
get a soft drink .
that should n't be a problem .
first you need to get your laptop . we can go to the supermarket and put them into the slot . it will ask you .
uh . . . yeah . . i 'm in a bit of a hurry .
i want to know about the company on the internet .
have you taken your temperature ?
well i 'll take it .
take it easy . do you want to come with me ?
i think first they are very smart and you can learn more about the job around your work .
what are you going to major in ?
i know . i have to prepare for the examination before i get ready .
but how can you be so calm . you loved her so much .
my washing machine is n't working .
i m sorry .
yes i have it .
what ?
yes i 'd be glad to .
i d like to order number 17 no . 23 and no . 24 .

now i see . do you need help with anything ?
here you are .
that s really nice . are you planning on having another one ?
i appreciate it .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
you won t get lost .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
his parents must feel very happy .
i don t think she will do such a thing .
good boy . i will tell your friend that you will be here .
well it 's true .
but i like its color .
anyway it 's my ideal coat . i 'll take it .
i 'll take one too .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to my liking too .
say how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
i have n't even told you what it is yet !
it sure is .
i see . but what if he indeed took up too much force ?
why do n't you try counting sheep ?
i m not sure . i guess i m too good at school . i m too tired !
wow ! that s really interesting . and it took a long time to get a course like that ?
yes it is .
how ve you been ?
well you ve been working so hard . i ve been thinking of taking you a class . how about yourself ?
so what s the problem ?
this is the accounting department . i 'm glad you like it .
that 's interesting . well anything else ?
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
how do you think about her ?
wait a minute . then i think she must be able to do something better .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes ?
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
who won ?
just tell me .
sounds like fun but he has to be independent .
he took the picture when i was a kid and he got the flu .
you mean it is not created by the burglar ?
i 'm just thinking about that . why are you acting the same ?
you too . have you lost some weight ?
you missed a court appearance .
as long as you bring your ticket and id card into the slot .
let me see . oh yes i have a radio too .
it 's all right . but it 's your fault .
this ca n't be true .
no .
it 's a bit .
then does it go well with my sweater ?
a dozen will be fine .
i 'm sorry but she just broke up with her boyfriend .
can you tell her how she is about the driver 's license ?
i think she is quite a bit bright .
it s just a rash .
i do n't like the work .
all right . over here sir . how are you today ?
i had a wonderful time .
let 's say about 600 ?
she 's the one who saved the life of my son at the beach last year .
is she really ?
she was on the way to work . it 's so nice .
in the meantime do n't forget to tell us if you are in love with the first person .
she 's very nice .
well i 'm not going to tell her . i 'm ready for the opportunity to put out with her in my hands .
i feel sorry for her .
i think you are making a fuss . she 's the teacher who caused the bet .
i did . why ?
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
i am the manager . what can i do for you ?
fine . but please let me know if she 's got it .
well maybe we can just get a bite to the theater .
oh sorry about that . but what 's the matter ?
what 's it look like lady ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in is n't it ?
could you make another tough decision ?
mom where 's my wallet ? it 's my favorite .
and your phone number ?
that 's too bad . i hate it .
ok . take care .
my hard drive crashed .
is there a desk available ?
i do n't know . they are really roses and they 're not very fashionable .
yes . it 's easy . i 've been waiting for your call .
that 's great ! have you got any special ones ?
cool ! but what is he doing ?
what ? huh ?

yes . he is from honest with me i think .
you can always change your mind . you just did n't know how to goes .
but you 're ready for everything else ?
yeah . i 'm glad that you could get back to me so fast .
yes . i am sorry .
so what did you do to the party ?
this is jim . he is n't too happy about what you promised stars . com .
it 's the only thing i want to do .
it 's much worse than me . what can i do ?
then i guess things must be wrong with you . i was n't expecting you .
i 'm so sorry she was n't too happy with that . i bet she had n't seen you for that .
but we just drove across town . ca n't we just go in to see him one last .
yes he got the message .
wow ! i thought they were going to win .
i do n't think that they are going to be so pleased .
that 's great !
you 'd better get on with your homework !
please wake me up at 6 am .
yes . i hope it does n't matter .
yes .
fine with me . i 'll watch the inside .

i felt ok .

your present job is something better . why do you change ?

i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i am sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
it 's still early .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
is it ?
yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 pm this thursday afternoon . please come on time .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
i have to work .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
i don t know .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
all right . let s go .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
i think the letter of inquiry should be written briefly . if it 's too long i 'm afraid the employer wo n't have time to read it .
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
how long will it take to get there ?
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .

what was the problem ?
i just stayed home and played until midnight but i had no appetite .
oh yes ?

i 'm looking for the cameras .
how about this one ? it 's the new one .
i am not sure .
so what happened ?
no that 's enough . t hank you .
how about your steak ? it 's a rare medium or welldone .
what 's wrong with it ? it 's filthy !

oh that s almost right . but don t worry about it .
do you ?
i 'm going to need to see your id .
i guess you ve got the bottom bunk . what s the problem ?
it is not expensive but it 's a lot of money .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
it is twoyear and covers parts and service .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
nothing . it 's just that i am not in a bad mood these days . i 'd like to have a rest of the family .
i was just looking at the newspaper .
wonderful . well i ll tell you about it .
incredible . by the way what are these in the plates ?
you know that i care for you . i hope you 'll recover soon .
yes they are . but you 're not forever .
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
is it a long journey ?
really ? what would you do if i m not careful ?
excuse me miss . what 's the tour time we have ?
that will be the best option .
ok mom . i 'll do that .
i think i 'm going to get myself to the hospital .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
it 's pretty good . how much is it ?
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
your history is really a good game for some time .
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and forget and forget and forget and forget and forget and forget and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
did you want to go to the magic kingdom ?
thanks ! i am totally pumped up .
what do you think that now ?
what do you think i should do ?
well you ve been working with some organization for more than your career . it s a little practical .
come on mom . it s unfair . i 've been here for almost two years .
yeah but i am just not used to it .
true but i m not interested in any kind of pet .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
my computer wo n't turn on .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know but i find these sorts of things hard to say . they wo n't like it if i tell them to turn off the tv . now i just hope the show will end soon .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you think your parents are just a child ?
i have already known that . i did n't get the scholarship right ?
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
i love the book . it 's a lot better than mine .

you 're welcome .
you must feel really worried right now .

yes . but i 'm not sure about it .
ok but i 'll have to look at it .
see you !
is there anything you need ?
what do you think about the teachers ?
and it 's so popular that i think it 's called winter people in america like the world .
and it 's amazing that i like the moon cakes .
i do n't think so . i only got one thousand dollars .
good idea ! i have a lot of work on it . how do you think it is about the same time ?
as a matter of fact i like the sound of stepping on the snow very much .
what is your idea ?
well i have a lot of work . i 'll see how to goes .
that 's wonderful ! i ca n't wait to see the beautiful place .
it 's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do . many people resolve to quit smoking lose weight or stop nagging their wife etc . however it usually lasts only for a few days !

do you eat a lot of special food ?
that s the beauty of the service department .
well cool !

it 's a traditional family . it seems there are never a lot of reasons .
i guess so .
what a pity ! i have never thought of that before .
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . . .

what about the surrounding area ?
no i am not interested in it .
you can go to the bank of interest and ask for leave .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
oh i 'm sorry .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
what 's a wonderful day ! i 'd like to have a drink .
have you figured out how you are interested in our company ?
i won t be able to get any done by myself . have you got a job ?
the next game i will definitely be there .
that s terrible ! what do you think ?
your total is forty three dollars .
i have to work .
i also feel that work efficiency here is very high . and you have to stay in the same place .
of course i have . i make many friends .
that 's good . are you planning on immigrating to another country ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
you 're welcome . i wish i had something cold too .
no i think that rice will go perfectly with my chicken !
ok .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .
oh that 's too bad . maybe he 's waiting for me to get to the class .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
i used to be one of those .
yes i do . i have a lot of homework to do on a computer .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
did you see his face ?
no . could you go to look for me ?
congratulations !
no i did n't .
have you had any previous job ?
yeah we should have more roads built .
nice to meet you too .
alright . a double room with a blue and a blue tie .
i think you are right !
no . it 's all yours .
well i think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room and maybe some new drapes for the windows . also a grandfather clock would look great in the den . perhaps you could buy some <unk> plants for the dining room
i 'm not sure . my family just went to sleep .
nice to meet you too .
to tell you the truth i do n't like it . it 's hard to dance . i have n't had much time to say .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i 'd like to but i do n't like any .
no . but i 'm not much of a dancer and i do n't like dance .
yeah the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
well i guess i can have a try .
well . i think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the <unk> .
no . the ancient chinese think they are just opera costumes . do you like the embroidery ?
is n't that the place ?
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west the purpose is generally quite <unk> savor the wine .
that 's great !
they are from schnitt 's of rudesheim germany . would you like to check them ?
this is designed to exclude them from domestic market is n't it ?
it 's very popular in ottawa and i have never been there .
absolutely i love temple fairs . beijing has several temple fairs recently . they are different from each other to some extent but also have a lot in common .
well how about like this ?
ok . let 's go .
ok . let 's go .
i 'm a real fan of walking .
then you must be interested in disco .
yes i have a lot of work to do .
well then the business suits you very well .
you 're a good dancer .
ok let 's go .
all right . i like it very much .
all right . what 's your favorite dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
i appreciate the building so much . i am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building .
of course . i ca n't dance to it .
i guess i 'm glad exams are over .
i think so .
i ve been accepted !
well i think the music is too fast .
yes it 's my favorite .
how do you spend your weekend on your diet ?
how about a disco ?
sounds like a good idea .
that 's fantastic . i think you can go to the gym .
it 's very nice i like it very much .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just that you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
swimming . what about you ?
what about the swimming pool ?
no sir . the price is varies according to the seats .
i do n't know . i 'll just have a beginner in my opinion . after all it 's not easy to learn .
i think the biggest issue of people is a little bit too small .
but i do n't think the old days are you ?
it 's already december you know .
what do you mean ?
that s a good idea
let 's watch the canadian team . they have a good manager and a great coach .
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
i prefer spring when little by little everything becomes green and the weather is almost always nice .
could you fill out this form ?
it s the same in balloon . but i am afraid it will be too cold for us . this is the best season for our picnic .
why not go to see a walk ?
yes . it is sunny and warm yesterday but the weather is really blowing hard now .
is it hot in the summer ?
i know what you mean but i 've got to be cold .
it 's often windy in march . it 's always warm in april and may but it rains sometimes .
i like spring too .
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
the weather is gorgeous here .
oh how about summer ?
look at it 's almost as if it 's not too hot .
yes that 's true .
no i 'm not .
you 're from canada ? that 's nice .
i 'm sorry but it 's my fault .
how much do i owe you ?
not at all .
thank you . that s very kind of you .
it 's very kind of you . i hope you can do better tomorrow .
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
sure what is it ?
i want to order a large birthday cake several kinds of cold dishes pastries and fruits .
i 'll be back on friday .
what 's the hurry ?
i do n't mind . i can come to see you tomorrow .
i am . what 's the weather like in new york ?
come on . a tour of the campus has just started .
i 'd love to .
go to window number eleven .
well that 's a good school .
this morning . i mean . . .
ok . see you tomorrow .
let me know if you 're interested .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green <unk> . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
it 's too small for me to wear .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
no .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
i know but i am not sure what to do .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
you are welcome . and we have 24 hour reception . please do n't hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions .
do n't mention it . you can enjoy it .
i 'll see you tomorrow then .
i am making a bookcase . give me that hammer please dan .
so ?
yes he does .
would you like to pick him out of a lineup ?
i 've been playing football since high school .
you did ? but i ve got a bad cold .
ok got it .
oh i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a date already .
what about that ?
this friday evening ?
let me see . . . the reservation is for six o 'clock .
i did n't . but i 'm afraid i would n't have any complaints . i 'm terribly sorry to say this .
oh no . they are just opera costumes . do you like them ?
would you like to go out to have a look ?
yes i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
not so soon . i thought i 'd come and fill out some forms .
it 's my pleasure . hope you can see us again soon .
this is it ?
you re welcome . and welcome to our room .
well i think we should go now . it 's getting pretty late .
you 're welcome and i apologize for the inconvenience .
nothing exactly .
i know . but she always gives me goose bumps . i feel sick of her time .
i just do n't think so .
perhaps you can give her some kind of dutch food .
where is the place ?
i 'd love to . i 'd love to get a <unk> .
oh i see .
you 're right . i think i can work out the evenings at the beginning of the day .
well the exam is free to do well at night and when you have school .
in that case i think you should take a look at these five men .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . do n't you see the attraction of stop ?
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and you 'd take some exercise every day .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . it s a very exciting game for spectators to watch .
you should be more careful about the time .
i was just thinking about someone i went to school with this boy i was quite friendly with in third grade .
of course . they are the fashion victims who just have to wear them as long as they are exercising in the united states .
well then . thank you for your advice .
stop producing cigarettes .
i felt ok when i came out .
eight hours a day .
very interesting . so it seems you are quite an excellent one .
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
these ? they 're excellent . they 're on sale this week .
i can hardly stand these wet and cold days .
but you know i 've been working overtime lately .
i have to tell you that i 've got to run this morning .
then what should i do if we watch a comedy ?
what about 8 ?
that s a great idea .
yes you are right .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you 're right .
no . the road is n't big . it must be much tougher .
not really . i was watching the tell you about this program . so i thought i 'd go to a concert . it was interesting to see the news .
i have got one .
i know . those two boys are walking away .
yes that 's right . the language is very expensive and is usually not expensive .
oh come on ! i ca n't believe it . oh no ! i hit the road .
i was n't feeling well .
that s fine . i ll send a fax home . my fax is waiting for me .
i do like the story . i just like the pictures .
very much . i 've already got mine .
wait a few minutes and i 'll go there with you .
at 8p m tomorrow night .
july 20 ?
then my son drove into a tree
thanks again .
do you think we should go out after dinner ?
okay . let 's have a look at the menu .
she is in a private school .
i 'm sorry about that . i think it 's quite convenient for you .
about ten years .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
she went to the <unk> store in san francisco .
no i could n't fall asleep last night .
did you pay any of the check ?
yes i m a lawyer .
how many do you want ?
i do n't know maybe one hundred .
we can have a teacher here .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
can i have a look at your present company ?
about 100 .
can i have a look at it please ?
that 's right . the school is good for them . they go to school in the morning and evening too .
what is it ?
it 's a skill .
really ? that 's too bad .
she is still in a coma .
it sounds very emotional .
what are you going to do ?
it s very good .
really ?
she 's going to be so pleased with this .
what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .
how old is he now ?
he is in his late thirties .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's checking bags . he s an official in the customs .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the <unk> young man .
oh that 's very nice of you . but we have to go now .
what about the one after that ?
may i have a look at it ?
sorry i 'm afraid i 'm busy tonight . i 'm going to bed on saturday .
i 'm sure you do n't want to see the film . oh i 've got to go now .
how about the weather report ?
really ? how do you know that ?
well everything is just fine .
yes . but i 'm afraid he 's going to be be invited by the nose .
sure . i hope so .
yes i am . he is in a bad mood for a job .
how long did you stay here ?
it 's the first time i 've got to go .
i think he must have the confidence in them .
what about a holiday ?
that s fine . how about the 30th at 400 p . m . ? is an hour enough ?
i 'm interested in your advice .
ok . goodbye .
that 's great .
you should take it easy . but it 's not serious .
yeah .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
ok that 's good . we have to go to a very serious restaurant .
i 'm sorry but i do n't have the slightest idea .
but she did and made me disappointed .
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
yes i can . i can only use the computer and the internet pretty well .
what kind of books do you like ?
well standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . express is the fastest but it 's also the most expensive . it only takes three days and you can track your package online .
do you play table tennis ?
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall . shall we go there ?
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
do n't worry . i 'll have to work with my visa .
i guess i ll just have to tell mr . robinson that you re too busy every evening doing god knows what . . . god don t go on like this . if you absolutely refuse to take her out . .
it 's an old superstition . if we have thirteen people at the table then it means bad luck . can andy bring a date ?
em it 's delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
i 'm going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
i 'm going to help my prepare .
that 's too bad !
hey do n't forget to buy a suit for me .
i 'll be happy to .
when does it start ?
ok . i 'll be there .
i do n't know . i think it 's a little popular <unk> but i do n't know the ending .
you did ?
yes . it 's been a week since we were married .
i was thinking of seeing you me and dupree . it 's a typical hollywood blockbuster .
it does n't matter . i will probably call my wife and tell her what she is doing .
yes it would be nice .
well it 's a little different . i have to admit .
what about this one ? it 's a very expensive dress .
i would like to reserve a few voted for you .
yes . i 'm just checking out .
really ? where are you from ?
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
oh i 'm afraid i would n't be able to . i 'm going out of the town on business .
yeah i ll come .
well i think i 'm going to have to look at the first light and then i 'm going to look at the laboratory . you have to do it .
sure . i have on this street .
no problem . that would be great .
sure . when did you happen to him ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
no thanks . we just need our check .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
it 's not at all .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
i have to work .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
how many people and ron have ?
hi bob . i need to ask you some questions about the job you want .
well i have to get a lot of done in the mirror . can you give me some idea of the chicken ?
i have lived here for twenty years .
can you speak any other languages ?
may i ask why you 're returning the radio ?
do we have a large selection of different dogs or cats ?
ok . i will .
anything else ?
i 've been away on a vacation .
i just went to see my uncle recently .
since last night .
what do you think of it ?
i just started working out .
what is your major going to be ?
i 'm majoring in english .
but sir many employees use instant messaging to communicate with their clients .
i have been told that i 'm not the only one who has done that .
what a wonderful job ! how have you been ?
i am glad to hear it .
i hope everything will be smooth .
yes . i graduated this past june .
where are you from ms . baker ?
fine just fine . thanks .
it 's time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
oh yes . are you kidding me ?
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
how did the business trip go ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
we have a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked .
i don t know . i m going to be a baby .
whatever . have a drink of water .
oh she is the mature stable feminine type . i think i d have to go with her .
i understand . she 's married .
tom that lucky guy .
he is out of luck . we have been getting along with each other and fight last night .
that s too bad .
terrible .
she s too old to follow me .
he is all right .
sounds like fun .
to tell the truth it 's really a way to control your eating habits .
to tell you the truth i do n't think he 's going to be on the right track .
how did you know that he has boyfriend ?
there is a fire in your building . you need to evacuate immediately .
there are a lot of games like gold .
the man behind the back looks like her .
you bet .
i do n't know . maybe it 's pretty but i think her grandmother is a little different .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i think i 'm getting the wrong bus .
i do n't know .
thanks for helping me .
are you serious ?
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am afraid i 'm not going to be able to attend the math teacher .
how can you be so sure ?
he knows a lot about law and he s eloquent too .
never believe his words .
no i do n't think so .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
yeah . he 's really a good person .
ah yes you 're a real <unk> man .
what was your score ?
thank you .
i think i am an excellent student . but i am not familiar with the western culture as the romans do .
he said he would celebrate his girlfriend 's birthday .
yes i see . please fill out this form .
we 're glad that there 's been a lot of people here since the date is n't too noisy .
that s ok . is it better to get any sleep ?
here is the room . did you need anything else ?
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
oh how awful ! but i 'm not sure if it does or not .
we were able to come down to the subway station tomorrow .
i think it 's too early to say so . we should go now .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
i 'm afraid she is n't in that type of work .
you said it .
it seems that you really want to continue to learn something about it .
well we have a lot of difficulties in getting along . we have to let each other and get along with each other .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell me .
really ? how so ?
forget it . we seemingly need to take off the bus .
i will try my best . they can hang out with them .
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
he does n't think so . you 'd better never give him a chance .
no . i don t think so . i m very fond of you .
i like you . i am so jealous . i like them .
i do n't think so . it 's a good idea .
you can always try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol . the most important thing is that the rule are eat are eat .
i am not happy about the like it . it 's not very much for me .
i 'm afraid i like the smell of flowers . can i take your coat ?
i do n't think so . it 's impossible to equate wealth and happiness .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
and so i bought all these books on having kids and . . .
can n't be better .
you speak good english though .
five . besides my parents and me there are my brother and sister .
do you have your family here ?
he s a teacher .
it was hard to believe but i 've got a chance to do .
i see . do you have a lot of people in your country ?
it 's hard to say . but my father is very dishonest .
what s your parents think of all had a kids ?
we get a couple of different kinds of dogs .
well i hate to tell you this but we 'd better learn something from him .
thanks i will .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum i was hoping you d like to come with me .

no . thank you . i can handle it but thanks for the offer .
ok i will see you then .
ok . bye .
poor cat . it s not his fault .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
sometimes .
yes . it was the worst time in my life .
what ?
she is expecting .
how do people handle them ?
well what about your mother ? how about this one ?
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .

what happened ?
i think you are really a shoulder .
what symptoms does she have ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
take it easy . they will get caught .
thanks for your help .
i think it s horrible . i think people would be healed !
and the restaurant in the city centre is right behind the city .
my husband is a lawyer .

yes he would . he s so football !
i think that will be fine .
okay .
i have it finished by the end of the week . i ve got to get it going now .
she wished good luck to you .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
well people in your country are important to be independent .
at least you re right . i m not going to quit drinking coffee though . it s not that serious . the chinese thing that i eat is that i don t feel like having to smoke .
oh good evening jim . i hope you don t mind my leaving tomorrow .
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .

i hope so .
yes we are .

in the spring .
how about summer ?
well . . . we re not sure yet . we ve been there for a few days before .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
what do you suggest i should see in new york ?
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i did .
you speak good english though .
yes it is .
no wonder you always look so active .
fine ! how are you ?
i 'm fine too thank you .
where are you from sam ?
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
yes .
how many do you want ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
good luck !
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages .
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'm sorry but i ordered sole not the same as the others . will you change it ?
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
ok .
it 's quite a while .
that 's a good idea . what s on ?
someone took me to the hospital .
you mean it was n't cold out at all . we had a great time .
yes . what can i do for you ?
hi li hong . this is alice .
wow ! what s up ?
hi susan . how s everything going ?
oh that would be great .
how about 7 o 'clock ?
good evening david .
good evening david . it s so good of you both to come .

i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
nice to see you again .
oh thank you .
how do you do ? nice to meet you ms . smith . i m jack stevens from the marketing department . here is my card .
hi this is john . i want to speak to linda .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
fine today though a bit under the weather last week .
oh i ll try .
i hope you will stay here for 3 days .
thank you for the information .
i will . do you have any ideas which offers to this job ?
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
well i m going to go .
yes i am . i opened an account with you about a month ago but today i 'm working in a foreign enterprise .
you have to eat so much sweet and sweet .
i can help you with that .
yeah . why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
yes .
do people in this office ?
ok . why not you try the basket outside and fill it up by thursday afternoon ?
i understand . and what is the rent due for ?
we charge ten cents for each box .
but the health insurance and its cost has a discount of 4 .
there are some paperwork but most of the employees charge .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
not really . what about you ?
i could have a look at them and see them .
yeah . they are my kids .
not really they just started living at home .
i see . well my parents just mentioned that when i 'm a child .
i have to work on a day 's day and do n't think i 'm going to have a holiday too . it 's just a good time .
i know i have to learn that myself but i just do n't know how to live at home . living at home is more important .
oh that 's 42 .
i 'm sorry . we will get married next week .
my mother would have ? i did n't know .
that sounds interesting .
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds like a good idea .
the main external factors .
i have found many new ties for christmas . so it 's called a woman's wardrobe .
how about your family ?
how do you get along with them ?
oh yes i 'm the student engineer . my student lives in the united states and i 've lost a parttime job .
yes he is two years older than me . what is your father ?
he s the only woman in the class .
ok . would you please set the table ?
that is what my father is interested in .
my parents have just been helping him for a week or sometimes fight her baby . it s not easy for kids to go to the beach anytime .
no she didn t . my wife didn t want to . she said she didn t want to get married this year s her birthday too .
yes it is . but it s impossible to make a mistake .
i used to be an <unk> . but i 've never had a baby so i always dreamed of going to be a great scientist .
yes you do . they are just jealous of people .
oh does your wife have a bad word ?
but why do you want to leave your present job ?
she started a few years ago .
i did n't know that . what s the matter with you ?
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
do they have to do that ?
i am sorry to bring this up but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go ?
i ve been out of town .
going to a disco ?
i worked in sales at a small town .
when did you begin to work ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick . i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
i 've been here for more than ten years . you must have seen the exhibits .
oh . that s wonderful . thank you very much .
i have never sports and i need a good rest these days .
yeah i went to the gym and was wondering when i woke up this saturday .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
i have already read them in my resume .
in my opinion you should be sure to like this . classical music is helpful for your health .
well i used to be like this . but i got on my nerves .
how do you sleep or do you sleep ?
what are you talking about ?
maybe you re right . i guess i should join a math teacher .
did you have to take any bus ?
you can list your education at the top or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive .
it is the best season to view from the world .
do n't worry . i will go by myself .
you should have worked on a diet .
how about your mother ?
i did n't really like it . i was too excited to be like this .
my favorite is to play computer games .
right .
what do you mean ?
football ! it s a good game for some people .
do you mind if i sit down ?
well who is your favorite football player ?
well you really should n't watch so much television . you know what comes on .
most people like football . more boys like football than girls . a few girls play it really well . some people like playing basketball .
in my country football is certainly a lot of noise . but i do n't know how to play basketball .
oh yes . do you think she is going to have a look at your face ?
yes . i think my teacher is a good boy . he never won .
i think that i m getting a good job . i could not agree with you more .
yes . there are three persons in your family this evening .
to be honest i 'm not exactly sure .
let s get a soft drink then .
yeah ?
it s a good idea to have more active breakfast . my father is not very good enough to take care of himself and swimming .
then what about the tennis racket ?
some private collectors ! you can learn how to practise bungfu . i think it s a good exercise to keep fit .
well it s not as simple as that . it s just that the morning we can do more exercise there .
i have never been to either one of those who prefer to listen to animals .
do you know if you 're leaving ?
yes . it was a long time ago . i 'm terribly sorry to keep you waiting .
so what 's your counteroffer ?
keep your voice down . the matter is that everything you have in mind .
i 'm working on them .
i think so .
i 'm not sure but it 's fun .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
why are you so kind to say so ? i 'm always caught short .
i knew you 'd come around but i 've got to go now .
you really do n't think it 's time you know .
ok ! i can see that ! but you 're the boss !
terrible . i 'm just kidding . you two are such a wimp !
not bad . how about you john ?
yep . and they 're all sitting in the mouth .
i guess it does n't matter . i 'll give you a call .
and he 's giving lectures on business at the moment .
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
come on dear . i know you mustn t forget it .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s the anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
what happened ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he had better make a change .
what 's the matter ?
yes sometimes . but he is too strange for me .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an <unk> .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
sure they do . i am too excited to be relaxed .
where is the human resource office ?
let 's meet for lunch at eleven o 'clock and we 'll go to the restaurant .
by the way what 's your favorite groups ?
the song you hear now .
what did he do ?
i 'm just glad that i get a hold of them .
i do n't have any other dogs like that . i do n't have a lot of space for fun .
she still loves her .
how do you know about the company ?
you know maybe we could get her some concert tickets . who would know her favorite groups ?
yes . second language is a very difficult language to learn .
well it s true . she is always willing to have our own ways .
well i do n't know . . .
what s the gate number ?
i 'm in a good mood today actually . how about you ?
so what 's the problem ?
i just lost my job .
but to tell the truth mrs . bird i do n't like him .
no he did n't tell me about it .
and it seems to be interesting .
he 's away on a business trip .
oh it 's amazing . i am impressed by the chinese chinese chinese writer .
why ?
i didn t know you were interested in it .
i do n't think so .
the myoma is very popular . there will be a lot of people .
in fact we have a common view of the factory here . we 'll be eight to pick up the day from tomorrow .
it was a good game .
the operation starts at 10 0 clock .
yes it is .
oh i see . do you have the same exercises on the practice ?
it is n't hard to find a job like yours .
yes i do .
that 's too bad .
i suppose they are .
please go ahead .
good idea . i want some too .
actually the government has a history of more than 10 percent of the original amount . for the environment there is nothing else to do .
what do you do ?
well they are ! how could i get them ?
yes i will .
oh yeah it seems that i 'm the only one who never blogs .
really ? so you just took home a stray cat ?
what kind of food do you like ?
i do n't know . but my friend is in the library from work .
please get a mug shot in the next room .
yes .
oh really ? i 'm sorry . i know he has already left you should go to the cops .
so he is .
you 're right . i will never hear it .
actually there 's a blackout from the window !
i like swimming . can i play on the pool ?
you are welcome . bye !
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
yes . you must be very interested in your english .
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning ! i am anna lu . i 've come for an interview which was arranged .
ok . let 's discuss it together .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
yes i 'm worried about it . thank you .
i know you ca n't do that . this has to be honest . you 've been working too hard .
but these are the disadvantages of the game . i am not familiar with the domestic games .
yes there are many near our <unk> .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
it 's nice to meet you .
well i guess i could give you some advice . i have to do some jogging .
that 's good . i 'll go get a computer engineer .
oh how about the languages ?
i 'd love to try it .
i 'd swear that i ca n't take any long lines .
well then i guess you can say that .
you 're right . i can teach you .
yeah . and my parents work hard at school !
there 's no laughing one to me .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
what can i do now ?
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
the ref is called him !
oh how do you know that ?
you know i 'm thinking of him .
do they usually take the dogs or fish ?
oh you can say that again . but do you think of anything else ?
ok let me make a list of all the ingredients .
oh great ! i hope i can spend this spring festival with you here in beijing .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not sure if i 'll have a chance .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
what s interesting about chess ?
that s right . the guest who will be there .
it s a easy schedule . the coffee break is about the bottom of the game .
there are a lot of people inside like that .
that 's not the point . you 're kidding !
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
he was so sad .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
what about tea ? i d love to see you .
yeah i know what you mean .
that s too bad . i m sorry to hear that .
what do you mean ?
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
yeah it was . i could not have done it well .
i guess so . i can t bear to do that .
oh . i am sorry . i ll have to call now .
well rest assured that you have everything . we can do everything tomorrow .
no but i don t think so .
thanks !
no they did n't . but a few people said they were pretty good . let me go to a hospital .
i think it 's better for the environment too .
well in the evening i think i have been on the third week . when shall we go to the great barrier reef ? it would be a good way to take the opportunity .
i think something must be done .
i agree . but it would only be difficult to find goods on the market . sometimes they give them money to the government .
could you tell me how often you lost it ?
i agree . i think the government should do more research . besides making money the government should do more freedom in the country .
well i guess you will have to pay more if you lose your job you can t afford to take it .
my luggage has been <unk> in the downtown area . it s a very good idea to turn around the corner .
yeah . that s why i listen to it in the evenings . i usually do it as the romans do .
no . we had a fantastic time .
really ?
my understanding is that he will be angry with you .
he 's a little excited about him .
i think he might like to make a good choice .
what do you think his strengths are ?
the king is competent now . he says he has an infection .
he might be right . he is always busy .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
it s hard to say . i don t like football .
so you must like nba game .
it s hard to say . but i love the design .
that s quite a good idea . you can get a job as soon as you get a job .
no they are the ones .
that s unavoidable but think how would you keep up to date without television ?
which one is your favorite ?
let 's play together sometime .
yes i do . but i m a terrible team player .
then what about you re talking to me ? did you get any real running along ?
that depends on the game .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what about you ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i know what you mean . i have an idea of how they know . they have bought the same song at the oscars .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you 're welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
thanks . i appreciate it .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well you always say you 're busy .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
i said i had been to the doctor the day before .
what did he say ?
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
i do n't think so .
by the way my name is liu wei .
of course . it 's a hard one . the pain is only . and all the people can do is to hurt your work .
here are the suits .
very well . let 's see according to his vaccination record ricky has received his <unk> tetanus and hepatitis b shots . he is 14 months old so he is due for hepatitis a chickenpox .
hi clyde . this is my friend wen . she 's visiting from ucla .
well i am a manager . how about you ?
how do you like it ?
i have a test tomorrow .
what 's the matter ?
yes .

oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .

god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .

i beg your pardon ?
i said i had been to the doctor the day before .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
ok . when will it be ?
you 're too strict with yourself .
no it 's just the fish .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ?
i have to work .
ok .
certainly .
it 's still early .
oh sorry . that 's not my fault .
i just took a walk .
what is the purpose of your visit ?
yes it 's one of the best known in our group of people who are taking part in the labor union . it 's really a big vacation to be there .
can you just tell me how to use my yoyo ?
i do n't always have time to go to a gym .
okay . i 'll make a call .
we have to find a shelter .
well you could take a break . everyone will be here immediately .
ok . i will .
you 're welcome . and we 're looking forward to seeing you .
that 's fine with me . i 'd like to eat chinese food .
oh it 's a pity . i 'd like to start cooking .
do n't mention it .
but i am still under a lot of pressure .
no but what 's the matter ?
what was the problem ?
what test did i do ?
about how many people think they know how to put their foot foot off .
what 's the actual score ?
first of all you should do is make white rice and energetic . you should take it easy for your family .
wow this is a lot more than i thought ! thank you for your help !
that 's terrible . i could n't stop having any luck with these days . besides this is n't a car .
yes ms . in my office we must go to work .
well i ve been learning all day since i was a little boy . how are you ?
not bad . i 've made some changes in my life and my last year . i 've also been working on a project and i do n't think i 'm in a hurry .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
did you find a lot of money on his yet ?
what do you do with the victim ?
it it it always feels like some days .
thanks . well how are you doing ?
i don t think so . it s a great idea .
we can leave a message until 8 o 'clock .
maybe that 's a little bit expensive .
no i m afraid that s not my fault .
i d love to try . later let s go .
well what would you do with her ? we ve been friends for years and we could get a lot of rest !
whoa take it easy ! how are you ?
what is it ?
well i 'm not going to be . how does she look like ?
you can put a minimum of your account into this type of account .
well i just saw a horror movie last night . it almost frightened me to death .
the resume says that it s my first year of july .
yes good for you . the gym is free .
well i have a doubt . it s a pity because of a concept that s not very durable .
can i have a look at the review ?
really ? are you sure ?
yeah ! why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 'm not sure yet .
don t worry . he is an acrobat
i have to work .
you mean a lot to say .
it s not so safe . and there are still many left under it .
i m afraid there s . i think spiders and snakes are horrible . i think spiders and snakes are horrible . i think they have so many legs .
well i guess so .
we will come in this afternoon .
you re pretty lucky .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
thanks for the suggestions !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
of course not i appreciate that .
perfect ! we 'll go to your place and pick up your books and repair .
you 'll have to wait your computer so check the computer 's out .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
i like them especially the old page .
yes . what about you ?
i 'm really going to miss you . take care of yourself .
certainly . i like santa monica . it 's a very exciting game .
sorry i do n't understand .
it 's 25 cents . you can either besides the fine or the poor one you like .
i was going to go to sleep today .
yes .
what are you doing ?
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i ca n't . i am really sorry .
be seeing you then .
you are welcome !
so what are you going to do ?
that 's true . i guess working with so much money is not easy to do .
that sounds great ! how often do you think we should go ?
but i just got here . . .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
does he have any questions ?
i m not sure . i m too angry about it . he s a good guy .
so do i . that 's why it 's called summer .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
do you know anything about britain and america ?
ok please .
yes trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's what we like to hear a profitable business .
i do n't know . i have many credits this year .
well i 'm going to visit some relatives here for several months .
i 'll see you later .
it 's good to have a look . but it 's good to have a chat .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
what 's the matter ?
yeah . i was . . . you didn t tell me me . i wasn t in a bit of a hurry .
what do you mean ?
i didn t know it would be so nice .
really ? oh well i don t think so .
can you give me a definite answer ? i am very tired .
no . i couldn t .
yes he is two years older than me . what is your father ?
he s the only woman in the class .
ok . would you please set the table ?
that is what my father is interested in .
my parents have just been helping him for a week or sometimes fight her baby . it s not easy for kids to go to the beach anytime .
no she didn t . my wife didn t want to . she said she didn t want to get married this year s her birthday too .
yes it is . but it s impossible to make a mistake .
oh that 's 42 .
i 'm sorry . we will get married next week .
my mother would have ? i did n't know .
that sounds interesting .
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds like a good idea .
the main external factors .
i have found many new ties for christmas . so it 's called a woman's wardrobe .
how about your family ?
ok i will have a great time . you will love it .
no this is my first . it was the first time i was really sick .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
what are you doing ?
do n't worry . we ll be the first .
the same to you !
i know . stay with me . she then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . first though she had to discover her true cat nature . at the end she had a big fight with sharon stone who was the real danger in the company . she
it is nice to meet you too .
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen .
when i was little we had a few domestic dogs at home and we had fun too .
forgotten about it ? how could you ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i did n't know .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
ok well i ll see you then !
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how do you make that ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town .
going to a disco ?
i worked in sales at a small town .
when did you begin to work ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick . i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
i 've been here for more than ten years . you must have seen the exhibits .
my name is li ming . nice to meet you .
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
this is susan .
yes . and what do you think ?
no i often go back to see my parents .
of course ! it s a good game . you should come too . it s very exciting .
no . just like my dog . she s her dog s out of dinner .
ok . i just went to the store last night . you should have it bound to the email box .
sorry sir . i have made a mistake .
no i do n't . i go on a winter holiday instead . i go somewhere warm .
great . please fill out this form first .
what 's the greatest dance ?
well i m being a lawyer . i ve always wanted to have the best kids .
thanks for the advice .
i really like your outfit .
good . i think it s much more important to me .
i have to go to work .
yeah it is . i hate to go to work everyday after the day and not always get enough sleep .
i used to be an <unk> . but i 've never had a baby so i always dreamed of going to be a great scientist .
yes you do . they are just jealous of people .
oh does your wife have a bad word ?
but why do you want to leave your present job ?
she started a few years ago .
i did n't know that . what s the matter with you ?
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
do they have to do that ?
i am sorry to bring this up but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go ?
how much is it ? is three hundred dollars enough ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
you re right . we are having a hard time finding the red as our red as we are .
but we must have a lot of evidence .
i do n't know . can you make a little excited ?
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet dad .
you 're not the one who pulled out in front of me !
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
oh yes . i love it . it 's a beautiful country .
it 's a reserved opera named the monkey creates havoc in heaven .
i do n't like the acting . i do n't like it .
i have n't even told you what it is yet !
it sure is .
i see . but what if he indeed took up too much force ?
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i 've been to the monitor of my class .
oh yeah . you know there are some dangerous schools in australia .
how do you know if i can see a bus ?
well what time does the party start ?
yes i think so . can i get to the airport by bus ?
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
well there are a lot of things to do . i ll start packing and make sure we are provide the same as safety <unk> for the later than the automobile companies .
that sounds great ! how do you get that ?
the internal factors are composed of human resources team spirit <unk> spirit and coordination between different departments etc .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i 'm pretty good .
oh good . you are n't an excellent student . i do n't know how to help you .
the y . h . a . mun . the youth hostel 's association .
welcome .
i 'm sorry . i meant to ask you .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . .
lt 's a tv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to tom we 'd have the wedding in the etv ? he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
do you think it 's a good idea ?
thanks for inviting me .
what are you talking about ? i 'm not into talking about it .
you are right . but i like the style of summer .
i do n't think so . it s very nice . where in spring and autumn is the best season .
i know what you mean but i 've got to be cold .
i usually go to bed around ten days but it 's quite convenient and sometimes warm in england .
i like spring too .
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
well shall i call you again if you have a chance .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
why do we go to the park ?
it 's a beautiful city .
oh . that s a pity . i love it .
anything else ?
yes i think so .
no i 'm not .
really ? you look so young .
i m sorry to hear that . what s the problem ?
i do n't think so .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
that 's all right .
could you fill out this registration form ?
but there is a big car in this city .
why ?
good for you !
i will . thank you .
what s the problem ?
thank you for your hospitality .
do n't mention it .
the same to you !
are you doing anything special ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
fine . i ll be ready in a minute .
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
i ve got a fever and really a bad headache .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
maybe the food i will take about 20 minutes .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital .
oh yes ?
it s certainly the most important thing to me . the coffee break is that all right .
you 're kidding !
now she 's got a message .
you 're right . he sure is .
well the problem is that she speaks very clearly .
i would n't mind . it 's a bit difficult to be away from home .
i guess so .
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
can you print out the documents please ?
yeah . you know he probably would n't say that . this is a good thing . you should go to his office .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
yes . but i have been thinking about him for a couple of days .
oh sorry for bothering you .
oh i 'm not really sorry !
you re kidding .
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
how about some mascara ? they are very popular .
how about a mac ?
i tried but she said she was a few years ago .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i 'm not sure where she is .
you have to go to the phone with her .
no way ! it s not the end of my life .
yes . how do you know ?
oh hi david . you 're so helpful .
nothing really .
well that 's life .
i think i caught a cold .
i do n't know . i saw a white house and it was the best thing i ve ever seen .
that s bigger than you think .
you mean i was n't told her .
well she did and made me disappointed .
those are money bags . they are n't registered .
sounds good .
thank you .
i will . does it hurt when my turn ?
the brain locker ?
how about a dog ?
sorry i 'm afraid i ca n't .
he 's leaving on the 14th of the month .
i 'll be there .
oh she is doing great !
what did you do after that ?
but i have already got the address .
that 's great my parents are a bit nervous .
yes . we have to be there .
is the wedding ring ready ?
we 're going to canada to stay in new york .
yeah . i heard him through the internet .
well i trust that he wo n't come .
i guess so . while growing up i read hundreds of interesting english storybooks every year .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
a boss even though i don t think much of him i was a bit nervous .
yes . good for you .
ok well it 's just a little bit chilly in here .
it sounds great . when ?
i understand . thank you .
they are subject to hard training . and you know what they say yesterday is best for them .
i know . but it 's too hard to make .
what about taking your time out ?
you mean he has a <unk> guy who 's eyes ?
that 's true . i guess we all have to work hard .
well you 're right . so do you want to quit smoking or nonsmoking ?
thank you again for your visit . we are looking forward to your reply .
exactly . as long as you mentioned it we have learned how to deal with this kind of exciting attitude .
how long have you been in the hospital ?
i have some tablets for seasickness .
what do you think of your dating a stewardess ?
no but i 'm afraid it 's too expensive .
good for you . the company is very nice .
maybe it 's just a cleaning . she 's so laid it 's going to be such a <unk> .
well i think you re right .
i m not interested in this position .
no problem .
ok i will .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .
ok got it . i ll call you sometime next week .
fine .
it 's time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
bye jason .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
the internet has a problem with your id card and the money you owe me .
what do you think of it ?
sure .
no but it 's a long time .
i think there 's too much violence and it must be very interesting to write a lot of teenagers .
why would i do that ?
you are a real fan of him !
i have been looking forward to it all day .
what do you feel like having ?
my computer wo n't turn on .
maybe not . but he is too charming .
certainly . i ca n't dance to it .
what 's your favorite dance ?
i like dance the fast music .
well i am . sometimes i do n't know how to get to the office .
what do you think i should do ?
oh really ? who plays who ?
no he did n't .
what 's wrong ?
then he must be happy to control the healthy habits .
good idea . i will take the racket .
how ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
here you are . thank you and goodbye .
are you kidding ?
why ?
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yeah i ll probably just stay in and relax . maybe watch a few movies .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
must he say that he has been in love with her husband for a long time ?
then after you sand it you use tack cloth to wipe off any dust or sawdust .
what s the score ?
what s the score ?
how many do you want ?
everyone should be able to love who they want .
you are kidding .
i sure would .
good idea .
it 's too difficult to park your car in the city .
the problem is that i think he should do it . he said there were some accident on his rights .
i feel like bruce lee . you are a good boy .
if you do n't mind me asking how long it will take to find a job .
exactly if you like the room call the landlord right now .
of course not . i think there are a lot of good dishes .
what kind of antivirus software do you use ?
but i have to learn how to use the internet .
what 's the matter ?
yes i know that . but he 's as helpful as you think .
everyone should be able to love who they want .
you 're right . that 's quite a woman . does he have a face ?
i like the way you are so cute .
thank you very much . i am looking forward to hearing from you about this job .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> <unk> <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
ok ! i should have more time !
the buck stops here . i m going to turn it off like this game .
after my own baby !
good !
well thanks for your help ! i hope you didn t miss her .
now you ve been ok i am going to go with your hair and tie it up but i m not sure how to wear it .
well i trust you re only become interested in me .
yeah but i m working hard all the time . how about you ?
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
ok . our company is moving overseas and we re happy to say that the market has been address of the market .
that s great . do you have a particular type of food that you would like to eat ?
oh no . i broke your vase accidentally .
what a beautiful dog !
alright let s go for a walk . you know i can t miss the guy who s rented a truck and go on the way to play .
that s a great idea . you re a lifesaver .
ah thank you ! i 'm very excited . we were going to get married next year but then we decided to get married on holiday instead . it was wonderful .
that was before he heard stanley sing ! i guess he could have a very good voice !
you re right !
do you think that i should go shopping ?
oh don t worry about it . i m glad we can finally get something to eat .
i am not a thief vicki but i guess it was a bit stiff . . .
it is so terrible . the ball is always open .
yeah most of the time it was a nice holiday and i m tired .
oh no i m not . you chinese usually don t have any good records .
really ? i m sorry to hear that . why don t you just call me ?
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i guess so . i m not sure what i should do .
no it s not your fault . you know it s hard to find a way to find such a big way .
i do n't know . i guess it is a good idea to have such a company who is on my second floor .
steven i m not sure what you re talking about ! you have no plans for this week !
that s great ! i wish i could just meet you here again sometime .
wow that sounds pretty good . i really appreciate your help .
your dream will be a success .
alright mom . where are you going ?
no the one next to it .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
no the one next to it .
where do they come from ?
whoa !
really ? let me see . . .
that is exactly what i have to do . if you can lower the price is reasonable now we can make a network of <unk> between the bank and other entrance fee .
ok hold it . remember to be punctual next time
oh i know . i m a crazy fan of mice .
i love that they smell nice !
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well what 's the problem ?
no problem . i 'm full .
you know he is just a baby .
no i do n't . i 'll take the test .
it was all right . i guess i did n't have any good time .
i think you 're the right person .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you you you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
i think so .
how did the business trip go ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
how much is the fine ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
are there any other advantages ?
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i have a big date tonight .
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
good gracious . i m sorry that s incredible !
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it 's hard to keep track of everything around here .
just a minute . let me get my bag .
i 've only seen a few classical music in my country . i think i might have a better time .
but they 're all handmade . you know the title of the american girl 's favorite dishes .
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
i bet you had a wonderful time .
no problem but no doubt about it .
i think it 's time for me to decide .
definitely . that 's why many people have to prepare for the holiday .
what do you think about her ?
i 'm sorry . the bus tour has already been delayed .
it seems that kids have become blind often .
it 's idea . anyway we have to get off the same day as before .
do people get along well with each other ?
i thought you were right .
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
look at this mountain bike . it is only 330 . do you like it ?
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
you are making really class !
is n't there anything wrong ?
i 've been snowed under with work since my boss was away on business .
you 're right . it 's a good idea to have some free time studying abroad .
that 's a good point . you know that if the teacher 's fault or not .
it 's a holiday in australia . we have a lot of difficulties in getting along . the chinese dishes are very different from the jobs in california . i guess in western cities the big family have been dreaming of and that all the time . there is n't much noise and people in living room .
so no . 4 is your favorite . which one do you recommend ?
may i say that now ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
i d like to be a little bit more than that . does the rate include a double pay ?
she is my grandmother 's niece . she has her heart attack and <unk> her !
yes i 'm the general manager . and here are the general manager of the company .
do people get married young ?
i think i am an excellent student . but i am not familiar with the western culture as the romans do .
he said he would celebrate his girlfriend 's birthday .
yes i see . please fill out this form .
we 're glad that there 's been a lot of people here since the date is n't too noisy .
that s ok . is it better to get any sleep ?
here is the room . did you need anything else ?
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
oh how awful ! but i 'm not sure if it does or not .
we were able to come down to the subway station tomorrow .
i think it 's too early to say so . we should go now .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
i 'm afraid she is n't in that type of work .
you said it .
do you have any sunscreen lotion ?
well we have a lot of difficulties in getting along . we have to let each other and get along with each other .
yes we pay attention to your manner of quality and style of quality . make sure you choose the right color or the finished products in your end . we do n't have to deal with any part of the transportation .
the one desk is on the second floor . there 's also a garden with a special view for the river .
ok . i see .
sure . here is the kitchen . i 'll go and get some popcorn first .
yeah . you can find a lot of expensive movies at this time .
will the company have some information in the folder ?
i see . we can go to the department and enjoy ourselves .
it 's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do . many people resolve to quit smoking lose weight or stop nagging their wife etc . however it usually lasts only for a few days !
ok .
come on ! a trip is a tradition game . besides you never know what to do .
it sounds good to me .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
certainly .
i think something must be done .
certainly .
i do n't think i 'm getting a good cook .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
you should be very careful with your hands and play the guitar .
but i 'm not sure .
ok so you are already a gold card holder with a sound credit history . that means we can automatically upgrade you to our new platinum card .
not always . but they like good meal .
no they 're not . but i think that chinese is the cheapest on the table .
yes we do . i will have an excellent time to come out and celebrate it .
the news goes about a few hours ago . it s very exciting .
i am going to the hospital to see susan .
what 's the problem ?
i 'll have to write you a ticket and suspend your driver 's license for the next few months .
i do n't think it would be lovely .
yes of course . i think it 's very nice .
i am going to send you a squad car .
i am not sure . how about you ?
what 's wrong ?
we are going to hainan for visiting .
yeah . i 'm thinking about going to the cinema .
yes . the girl is i 've been looking for three years .
what will you do this weekend ?
yes i do .
have you taken a walk ?
do you have any homework today ?
yes i 'm . i 'm just glad i 've been here .
ok let 's play it together .
i thought so . do you want to play poker ?
well first you have to turn around people along the same road .
now let 's watch the men and have a look .
yes i am .
really ? congratulations !
really ? congratulations !
it was also a <unk> of the two .
i was taking a walk in the park early this morning when suddenly i heard someone calling help . i rushed over and saw a man beating a couple of weeks ago .
do n't worry about your stress .
i could n't agree more .
but it is hard to believe this .
three years .
i d like a standard room .
i 'm a student . i 'll have to take a look at your bag .
it sounds like a good idea .
i appreciate you telling me .
i beg your pardon ?
would you be willing to come down to the station for further questioning ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
it seems so good after the picnic has snow .
i think the sun is good at the water . let 's go and get some water .
i know . i have to be there before 17 o 'clock .
well this is just a little bit stiff . i think i 'll go with these two .
ok i am doing great . i 'm also going to be a birthday party tonight .
you 're kidding ! i ca n't believe it . but you know what ?
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . .
sure how much do you need ?
it fits me well .
in 2002 .
no . i think i should have a try .
that 's a good idea to get some experience .
well i am afraid we have to go to the end of the year .
what do you need to know ?
please give me one more chance .
let me have a look . oh no ! we 're here for you .
maybe .
cool ! they 're going to be so romantic .
what do you need to know ?
but that means the apartment is too low for me .
sure . why are you in a hurry ?
i love this kind of life !
i 'm doing great . i just came back from work and it s my fault !
no . why ?
i need to get a costume for a fancy dress party and i reply do n't know what to get . will you come shopping with me ?
is that right ?
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
so how long will it take ?
it 's so cute . oh this is so light !
he 's got a promotion .
impossible . i hear it . my niece will do it . she s very older than her .
yeah well you should have . maybe it is true .
your bac exceeds legal limit .
fine . what s on ?
oh don t worry . i think it s just a lot of money .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
look next time get yourself some comfy shoes . you re gonna come back again with me aren t you ?
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
can i mail this letter for my department ?
do n't worry sir . you will be new here a lot .
about 2 o clock ago .
have you had any unusually stressful situations in your life lately ?
yes i am . i ve been out of town . i just got back .
oh no ! that s all right . i hope you re not turning into a sissy on me !
why did i have to do something ?
i 'm still not sure . i think it seems that i 've settled down .
really ? you re happy together .
yes . i 'm just glad to be with you .
that must have been something really interesting .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
next june .
i guess you re right . i ll come back later . my father still have a week to visit .
you 're right . that s just a part of the team .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
i 'm leaving right now . we 're going to get married .
it s my ideal place to be there .
all the laundry will be ready in three days .
that 's great . thanks for calling .
i m not good at it !
do you mean the noise ?
the palace hotel .
i m so happy for you !
it s not too bad . we ll try to find it .
it s true . we can also find a way to make up the loss .
five . besides my parents and me there are my brother and sister .
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
about seven years now . and you ?
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
ha ha i ll keep that in mind but don t tell my husband .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .
cindy s husband is ron .
how many children do cindy and ron have ?
they have two childrenone son and one daughteras well as one daughterinlaw and one soninlaw .
do they have any grandchildren ?
yes they have three grandchildrenone girl and two boys .
does their daughters get along well with her inlaws ?
yes she gets along with them quite well .
do they have a large family ?
their family is very similar to cindy and ron s family .
he s 21 . how old is james ?
he 's a year older than keith but he looks younger .
how s your father ?
he 's fine . he retired last week . it 's turning point in his life . now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .
can he do that ?
oh i don t think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
so he wants to have a more active retirement . good idea !
how do you want to spend your old age ?
in the same way probably .
oh yes he 's right .
it 's been a pleasure .
i 'm in a meeting with phil .
yes i do . this is linda speaking .
do you mind if i put my jacket there ?
okay tom .
i saw him last week . it seems he was a bit queer in the head .
my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .
i 'll be ready .
but i do n't know if it 's going to be late .
yes . i need to hurry up !
it was my pleasure .
good night then !
happy new year thomas . i 've been working very hard to be in this company .
thanks .
goodbye alice .
you 're welcome .

i see . do you have any experience as a tourist guide ?
ok .
have a nice day !
bye .
when do you leave ?
i should finish it as soon as possible .
okay . bye !
i 'm probably going to spend the day looking at cars .
i 'm not sure yet . i 'm just taking a walk .
well that 's cool .
well she did her baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces .

listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?

but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .

have you ever had any experience as a secretary before ?
i think that we have the qualifications needed to make sure that the company has been good for the past six months .
can you tell me about the balance sheet now ?
i stick to my principles and keep to the rules . sometimes they just lack enthusiasm . when i get them involved with something constructive some of them change their attitude later .

do you think that this is a little higher than i expected ?
i m pretty happy living there .
yes i do .
you have a job working experience at full health club .
that 's not a good idea . i do n't mind working on it .
they are all different .
i thought they wrote english usually cards .

certainly . we can work well together in an company and consider our employees to be happy in the future .
they always have a good reputation for their jobs .
well if you hear about something like that then you should go out and have a look at the roof .
are n't there any more than before ?
well i 'm really glad there were no complications .
all right . i need to do it right now .
as well as you know rebecca in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . so do you have the most credit details ?
yes i do . who are your financial backers ? who are the key competitors ? does the company have a plan for the ipo ? what would you say is the best thing about your product or service ?
what will you do this holiday ?
so what about the holiday ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i have learned a little french and japanese as well .
i guess working in the english is easier than most countries .
i learned to be patient professional and gained a ll of experience of computer skills .
yes i do . but i work hard all the time .

that 's fantastic ! what kind of food do you like ?
i 'd like to but i 'm not sure if i 'll have enough money .
what does the notice say ?
it seems that we have already received the letter .
but thank you very much all the same .
i do n't think that i would like to go now . thank you for your advice .
i will use my computer for this semester .
i 've got to go now .
i have working knowledge of windows and dos . actually i 'm quite familiar with both java and c programming languages .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
do you know how to use a pc to process the management information ?
i found it a garage sale once .
i try to say it but i ca n't speak very well .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . most people are living in the same country as the old people are working for .
what can i do if i want to take a few days off ?
i don t like the strong amount of information .
in short you should present the best of yourself throughout the interview .
believe me .
ok . you should know that the cost of offering houses but do n't they should be carried in a couple of miles .
gee how can i do that ?
i am very pleased with your advice .
what is that ?
what about my backpack ?
as a newcomer you are responsible for the buyer and the position you can get a loan .

yes . what i mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it 's in writing .
ok . where is the fitting room ?
yes i 'm sure they are .
ok please ask me when you need a reply .
that s not a bad idea . i am really tired from packing .
very good . do you know how to set the contract ?
would you tell me how many days you have to pay for the room ?
no . but we do have to work overtime at least .
i like you said that you are right .
there are no sales today .
i think that they are quite fit for you . they are very welcome .
you can use some time off . i ve been thinking of doing some time off for the past week .
six months .
well you 'd better send an email to tell the company . its name is bai ju hotel .
then what can i do ?
the website will give you a normal range and then tell you what your white blood cell phone number is .
that 's too bad . i had to call a phone call and text messages to you .
no .
what is my specialty ?
sure like taste variety nutritional value what i should do is move into an apartment off campus where i can see for myself .
but i see the results from your university .
in your major did you take the course ?
i 've been fed up with study .
no you are going to let the exam .
how do you think that 's good to know ?
yes i 'm liu yi . i d like to speak to mr . smith .

we have 3 years of experience in this area . there are more than 10 years of total .
what do you need ?
i have n't been able to watch my cable for the past week .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . i wish to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what do you mean ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
well a working relationship . i have to prepare the supper for several years . i think the company will benefit from the training .
i see . but what do you think our company could do ?
the most important thing is to us . the skiing was set by the end of the week .
yes but i prefer to get a computer and internet in the latest trends .
no really ?
yes . and suddenly i heard someone call my name . i turned around and there was this man looking at me . i did n't recognize him at all but he obviously knew who i was .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
is it formal or informal ?
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
good job . work harder at your job .
no but it 's not enough for me to pay .
it s good to hear ! rest assured that they can afford me to deal with this .
you mean noise ? you haven t taken a peek and you can t miss it . we have a lot of funny stories .
well i suppose i could get a business card that sounds like some company .
have you ever considered taking one of our online courses ?

i 'm sorry to hear that . but i have to go now . does that okay ?

people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
i graduated from peking university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .

that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .

the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see . why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .

providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .

certainly . and after your internship ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes i see . but you decided to leave them in 2006 right .
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .

yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
wonderful . so how do you think he had the perfect chance ?
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?

no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
do you have a cold ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .

i have a deposit account with my bank . there are some restrictions on withdrawing money but the interest rate is much higher .
i can hardly agree with you . we can adjust the price .

they were arrested by the police for drinking and they simply let them go .
would you see my face ?
you re fine with that ?
i have a terrible headache .
i thought they let you go .
i ve never used one before .
i 'm afraid that 's too much of a problem .
no but i m afraid it s too expensive . it s a little young .
how about friday afternoon ?
yes they re very busy .
they re very fashionable you know .
i did n't mean to .
i see .
just come back when you have your id with you .
i saw forrest gump the other day .

they caught the heavy wind .
let me tell you the officer that you ran it off today .
no i was out .
it was n't the same . i just wanted to give you a ticket .

i need to go to the police station .
we 'd better buy two tickets for the concert .

no . i have n't seen you for four hours .
ok . and what did you do after the show ?
blackout ? even the tv has the limit .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
blackout ? even the tv has the tv .
not really . but a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes .
would you be willing to come out to the department to pay more money on ?
no i did n't .
the toilet flushes really slowly .
what kind of case do you have ?
what s your plea ?
i was responsible for helping the police .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
what do you mean by saying so ?
what are you saying ?
yeah well i 'm very busy with work . i 'll have to think about it .
i think it is the only problem . i m afraid people are feeling deep about it .
they do .
thank you .
how s your job going ?
i 'd get it .
oh i see . you like good luck .
there 's no than 1 of them .
maybe you should communicate with the friends of course .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
have you talked to him ?
he said that we should change the money .
that 's too bad . in that case i do n't think he can leave this cross your head .
oh that 's just a waste of time . i think i 'm going to quit .
no i have not .
ok so you are already a gold card holder with a sound credit history . that means we can automatically upgrade you to our new platinum card .
it happened this morning .
let me take your blood pressure . you look anemic .
i called in sick .

the officer says that i ran a red light but i did n't .

i 'm very sorry about that .
oh thank you .
why ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted at me
is your husband still working as a team ?
no i did n't . i do n't think that they were pretty outdated .
well you can get a picture of the bread .
they had no reason for arresting me .
how did you get that ?
i do n't think so . the problem is that we can figure out the problem .
it is very comfortable .
of course not !
yes . i m learning chinese now on the internet .
i have no idea how to use the atm .
maybe so but i think it 's too hard for us to make ends meet .
according to the article you have no real need to worry . these countries have been buying and better ones for almost two years .
well we ve got plenty of time to stop . do you enjoy still in real world ?
well last week i invited her over to dinner . my husband and i had no problem with the food but if you listened to her then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . there 's just nothing can please her .

yes i used to be an <unk> .
oh i m not a <unk> !
yes i m a member of the student government .
i m sorry ms . fairbanks . i won t let it happen again .

i suppose we should do a lot of homework . what about the national day ?
in what way do you think the biggest environment is air pollution ?
i have a savings account with you but the money has been really exceptional .
yes please . and i can make an happy one if you have them .
so this insurance and i have a reputation for your patent law ?
not just a thoughtful granddad but a generous one too .
here you are .

i would like to cancel one of my accounts .

no . this is the receipt .
oh dear . well if i need to deposit some money into my account i can withdraw some money on it .
i 'm sorry for that . what 's your concept for ?
you should 've been really hurting for cash to live .

how many guests would you offer ?
i 'm glad to hear that . by the way could you tell me what the time it is ?
ok . i 'd like to but i 'm afraid the tour tour groups are higher than in new york .
is it already more expensive ?
for the bank manager ?
what s the difference ?
well standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . express is the fastest but it 's also the most expensive . it only takes three days and you can track your package online .
fine . i 'll be in later today . thanks for calling .
could you tell me when it will be back on ?
ok !
this is your receipt which you have to keep until the remittee receives the express . you can also check your post on our web . the post number is on the top of the receipt .

you 're welcome .
i m afraid i have to go now . the plane will take off soon .
ok . then i 'll see what we have .
all right .
ok . you will need to know the size of the machine .
quite right . according to the usual practice in international trade special risks are not covered unless the buyer asks for them .
here it is .
my computer wo n't turn on .
it 's hard to say . if you could guarantee me the quality of the packing the packing the packing at least one thousand units or the packing is too high .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
sounds reasonable . thanks a lot .
many banks of the matter of china are looking forward to one of the houses .
the goods are wellexamined before shipment . i 'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route .
ok i will take it .
ok i will take a small bag and a pair of glasses ?
i 'm a team player .
can i use the card for the service ?
thank you . i will tell my boss about it .
what about our outer packing ?

you can say that again .
ok . i think they are the right time to go .
yes that 's the second day .
we can discuss this in detail .
i 'm afraid it is too difficult to make a further reduction to insist . we ca n't make it any further reduction .
what time are you leaving ?
wow a lot of money i guess .
what do you mean ?
but i am not sure about it .
i 'm sorry mrs . wilson . i ca n't accept our commission . you 'll have to discuss the problem right now .

then i will arrange them to you in accordance with an f . o . b .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
that 's too bad . did you hear that in mind ?
i really was n't told anything .

would 700 be ok ?
all right . i 'm glad to hear that .
you can tell me more about our financial situation .
can you weigh these for me please ?
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
yes it is very expensive .
sorry we ca n't . that 's our rock bottom price .
well we could probably be able to make it tomorrow morning .
well . we only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents .
i see . payment by lc is the safest method but could you make an exception and accept da or <unk> ?
no problem . we 'll certainly have to discuss it with your manager .
according to the usual amount in your account it would help us greatly if you could give it a little more than i expected . the maximum repayment period of time deposit is 20000 rib .
well mrs . wang you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of <unk> it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er 's guarantee . we always require l c for our exports . and the other way round we pay by l c for our imports .
we can do that right now .
no i ca n't .

it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
i ve been out of town . i just got back from work .
hmm . . . well what would you say about the balance ?
i 'm the accountant in the sales department .
i would like to stay at new york 's degree .
in which please ?
do you know how to do a scheduling conflict ?
i m not sure .
i 'll take my money and get it for you !
yeah i did n't sleep a wink last night .
i 'm proud of you for standing by great base . i do n't think you ve helped make a big difference in making this line .
what ? you really have n't been working so hard .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
there are times of junk food you can eat from them . they ve been making a lot of money .
i was denied a visa ?
what is the internal factors that influence the company ?
could you please tell me your details and i 'll be right back .
well why don t you put the logo on the market ? we have a lot of hate making the calls from the client s desk .
sure what do you need to do there ?
i 'm having some trouble . how do you use this printer ?
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
what do you think will happen about this ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue .
it s my pleasure .
yeah i accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
