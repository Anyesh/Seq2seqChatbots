the heel is ok but i 'm not sure about the color .
it wo n't be long until your food is delivered . i know you 'll enjoy it .

i would like to make a specific inquiry to <unk> the circulation desk .
no we did n't . and we 'd better go to see him .
please take a seat . i 'll get it for you .
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
all right . but you 're going to love it . i had a great time .
this can meet you . what 's the problem ?
i see . thank you .
hi .

you 're right .
no you can t . it 's reasonable .

i see .
it 's only a few minutes walk .
how far is it ?
you 're welcome .
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
that d be great but could i have a cup of tea first ?

that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that might be going overboard a bit . how about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
that 's a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing .
that s even better than the real thing .
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than 100 you get a 50 voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
sure . the fitting room is right over there .

the round shape pair ?
what sports do you like best ?
well i have got you three first class tickets and i have reserved your seats . your seat numbers are 8a 8b and 8c .

no problem . i ll go right now .
what do you mean by that ?
you 're welcome .
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
well i believe you can do it .
that does look a lot of fun .
the dry cake in small oh here are too <unk> for me .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
um this steak i asked for to be medium rare .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
she 'll be in a minute .
is she pretty ?
what did you do ?
we 've got to go to the computer lab on the back of your computer . you see the results and other things on the computer .

how long will it take me to get there ?
only about twenty minutes .

not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .

can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .

do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
we 'll do this for you .
mangoes ? what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
can you eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .

it 's 150 yuan each and the price is 1 each .
okay i 'll take it .

no that 's all . thanks .
i 'm sorry we can t do that .
orange juice please .
would you like some ice in your drink ?
that s fine . i d love to try that new dish . you can get a good taste .
chinese dishes are exquisitely prepared delicious and very <unk> . they are very good in colour <unk> and taste .
let 's go to the bathroom and have a look .
well it s a little bit troublesome . the landlord will never end up the aisle .
yes . i heard that it was sunny and warm yesterday .
would you like another beer ?
well you can take 100 pieces of wine or 4 pieces of gum every day so you can get a 50 discount .
would you like another piece of meat ?
follow me . can you find it on the shelf ?
any place will be fine .
oh yes . it s just a few minutes walk . turn left at the traffic light and you ll see it .
ok thank you .
i m <unk> . my name is li jean .
ok thanks a lot .
i think the traffic is too heavy .
according to the map it is .
yes almost all the families have their own cars .
nobody told you what happened ?
boring ? how can it be boring ? it sounds like a tragedy .
let s meet at the park at 600 .
well could you pick up some sugar ?
sorry but he 's busy then too .
those are quarrelling .
i think we should take some bus .
i think you should hurry up . i 'll let you know .
i think that 's a bunch of nonsense . it seemed ok to me .
yup . let s go check out the bedroom and get a new one .
yes but the traffic is always pretty bad .
is it expensive to go in the city centre ?
the end of the world . how was it ?
off campus or on campus ?
i love this place and i enjoy working with people .
let s see . . . you ve got one too .
that 's good .
what day were you thinking of getting ?
i see . please fill out the form first .
yes it is . that s why i wanted to move to the rear .
good idea . would you mind telling me the exact information about the company ?
where to ?
wangfujing please !
that 'll be fine .
you bet . i was supposed to call my mother an hour ago .
yes of course .
no thanks .
i 'll do that .
i 'm completely lost . i 'm trying to find the way to my daughter 's home .
well it 's 12 .
oh i see .
would you like to change some money ?
yes here you go .
hello madam . where to ?
here a a big bag in the south park .
oh right . thank you .
but you 'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight wo n't you ?
100 rib .
here 's 50 yuan .
it is at the north of forbidden city on the central axis of beijing .
did you catch the taxi ?
that is here . can we get there in half an hour ?
why not ?
thank you .
hi lucy are you free to talk ?
yeah speaking .
and what is your speed at the end ?
yes i 'm not .
how do you want to your mustache trimmed ?
okay but the sent me the address and i 'll call you later .
see you then .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello steven !
wow what a surprise !
it was almost a year ago . i went to the boss of the boss last month and he went to everybody until i saw him .
i 'm fine thanks .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
well whatever i 'm going to do .
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
ok good luck to you . if you do n't mind i 'll call you if you give me a call .
thank you very much .
do n't you hit it off ?
i began to went there last month .
right .
i had a terrific working relationship with my boss even though we are very different people . because i 've had a number of bosses i 've come to realize that to make things work you have to understand what 's important to your boss . then you have to do everything you can to support him or her . it 's natural to think about your own
what is her strongest trait ?
well i am not sure if it 's a little late .
he 's <unk> with a friend who would do that .
what 's that ?
thank you sir . we 'll be expecting you then .
but i 'm not sure how to seven . i can do it . i 'll have to be there before 6 pm .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
no you do n't have to take the car with it . i should drive the car and we can take the stairs .
when i do what you think i should do ! you can t just leave me like this !
yeah ! i would be happy to see you in that world .
what does the fire say ?
i ve got a fever and an important presentation ! i ve always been thinking of going out all over the world !
uh i 'll just check it out . hey do n't move my car .
we 'll go out for dinner some time .
i think you have to pay for these fees .
i m looking for a sweater .
what s in your bag ?
i want an acoustic one . i ll need a few pairs of pants .
what s your camera ?
yes that 's the advantage of the article .
sure .
thank you .
but what do you think we can do ?
thanks you too . bye .
i d like to buy it . do you know what the national bank handles ?
here is it . could you show me the way please ?
i don t think that maybe i can try .
and what is it look like lady ?
i 'm sorry miss . but i just ca n't find any of it .
well you can still drive without problems .
that s right sir .
thanks you are doing so well .
you know what ? do n't mention it .
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
is this salami and bologna you have here ?
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes i 'm sure . i had a seat .
no way ! i can t believe it !
what is your turn on ?
great . they have a lot of gifts to do . i am sure this machine will suit me .
so what happened ?
it could be more expensive than it looks .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
what size are you ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's no hot water after 10 at night . sometimes i like to have a hot shower before bed . especially in the winter . it feels good .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s a great balcony with an incredible view of the park .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
maybe we could get some new furniture . better stuff .
i have n't thought of that .
yes it is very quiet . i love it .
can i have the bill now ?
the rent is 1500 per month .
that s way too much .
you re not going to be able to make these items today .
what do you mean ?
let me see . that 's three dollars and 25 cents .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you please reconsider ?
i think you re a real friend . what do you want to do ?
no . i am not really sure if i am going to be late .
i love it . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . it gives me a real sense of satisfaction . do you enjoy cooking ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah . i like authentic chinese food .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
do you want your eggs ?
what type of clothes do you have ?
the compact please . i think i am ready for a single breasted suit . could i try it on ?
you might want to tell me about the price of your order .
you ll find out a price there . i don t like the same kind of thing .
well i think you re absolutely right . let s go out and have a look .
don t worry . i ll take your laptop down . they re one hundred and twenty years old .
i 'll have them made in half an hour . what do they have ?
the 5th .
what s the difference ?
you ll be lucky ! i went to the school for a year s day .
you re welcome .
hold on please .
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i believe that it would look better for me to move on .
i can help you out the bathroom .
that sounds good . see you then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
i just think the two idea is very important .
yes .
should i bring anything with me ?
no but if you like to check out this video .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
but the price has been reduced by 50 .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it has great curb appeal .
the house is so beautiful .
i know .
with so few windows how can you even see what the problems are ?
that 's a nice dark angel .
let s look after it .
the best part is to take a few days off .
let me take a look .
only one .
it is ! look at this little table . let 's see what the interior looks like .
let s sign it for you .
does it ever !
sure .
it 's a perfect idea . let 's see what we can see .
it s a little expensive for me . what about the kitchen ?
i asked the three times .
thank you .
it s a felony charge .
i 'm sorry . he 's in the middle of the table . can i take a message ?
i m calling to see if you have a vacant apartment . is that right ?
do you think living at see it ?
you bet . i 'll be able to live with you .
i 'll pick you up around 8 00 .
i appreciate your help .
please do it in the meantime . can you do it ?
i 'll be glad to see you then .
we have a deal with the problem of life .
should i bring anything with me ?
no but if you like to do it you can bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any . i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
i 'd like to have a look at your air conditioners . hum this one looks pretty good .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
yes please .
yes .
how do you want to your mustache trimmed ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
how do you want to your mustache trimmed ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
oh i 'm glad to hear that .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
do you know how short you want your hair to be ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
thank you mr . smith . i 'll get back to you tomorrow morning .
cut it out please .
i 'm sorry . that 's not a child .
just a little tired . i think the keys will be too short .
what style do you want ?
i hope so . i 'm really tired of this oldfashioned style that i 've been wearing .
as you can see from the statements for my current account i have never been overdrawn . i 'm afraid it 's our mistake .
no we do n't need to cut off . you can cut the back and cut the back .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yes i do .
how do you want to your mustache trimmed ?
no you 're right . i also had no idea that it was great .
why do you say so ?
i like that .
it 's alright . you can go to the computer store over there .
no thank you . i do n't need a photo .
yes . we have one year warranty .
ok . i 'll pick up the <unk> around 6 .
thank you . you 've done a good job .
that 's unusual but i have n't seen you for a long time .
oh yes . i know what you mean . it 's hard to find anything that 's reasonable now .
so what have you been doing ?
ok . i ll go check out the kitchen next .
does it ever rain or maybe ?
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
ok . i will bring the house right away .
what do you mean ? we always do the same thing .
yes i do . i am a student now .
where is that ?
so you ll find a house to make sure that the house will be put in it and it would cost me a lot of money .
great . let 's go check out the kitchen first .
is that a lot of advertising can be found on the market ?
why ?
it 's not just that . we have to get back to the truth .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
is it possible to buy some new furniture ?
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
actually it 's better for the environment too . if you want to go out and have a look at the menu .
sure . let s go out and get a drink .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
i can teach you how to cook something healthy .
i prefer sea food .
do you know where i want to eat chinese food ?
i 'm not sure .
well it looks very nice .
we like chinese food .
that 's great ! i 'm glad you could talk to her . we 'd like to make it over !
i had some friends of my american friends last week .
that 's right . i would n't like them .
that 's great !
cindy help me order because i do n't like chinese food . the traditional food are well done with special sauce .
no problem . i 'll try to make sure you dinner is ready .
hmm . . . you 're really delicious .
which room are you looking for ?
that would be wonderful . i think i could get some tea . could you pick up some tea and a cup of tea ?
where is this small dress ?
i see . what about him on the internet ?
no you need to take your books out of the bookcase . put them in this box .
alright . and what is your name ?
you 're welcome .
actually it 's a long way to go back .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
the price of yours was ok .
thank you for saying that . we would like to give them a discount .
round about seven ?
the usual place . in ancient china the southern section or greece .
was there a discount taken after 10 or 10 days ?
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives .
but i want to get a pet that i want to buy from a small house .
i do n't think i can go there with friends .
now that you 've got a shopping cart .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
yes i am looking for the ones . what makes you think ?

i am disappointed with your work lately .
anything else ?
is there anything else wrong with it ?
anything else ?
have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?
well when the host ask them to <unk> the amount they ask you what they want to eat .
yeah i know but i would like to be a little sick .
come on ! don t be late ! the guests can just turn off the tv . you can just leave the stain on the side of the hill !
the chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good ! is that ok ?
how about the flowers ?
you are right . i feel sleepy is n't that bad ?
i never thought about that but they passed out at school .
no i did n't . could you go to the store to look at their menu ?
i 'm always interested in it . but i 've always been busy at a soup kitchen before the meal . it is hard to do it .
that 's not a foul ! i keep it all up ! does it work out ?
i go to panda express for my chinese food .
yeah i ll also have a cup of coffee and having a cup of coffee .
that 's true . every month i am putting on a diet .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music .
lots of potatoes carrots and onions . .
people hold parties to eat healthy still getting married . we have no barbecue at all .
yes most of our eat is large enough for people .
yeah we should also eat hamburger and potatoes .
we eat at the cafeteria .
yeah . i also heard that food was so popular . i thought the food was difficult at the beginning .
my absolutely favorite kind of pie is apple .
i 'm awfully sorry . i have to do this to work before it rains .
well first of all i need to make sure that our guests are free to order .
it 's not as bad as you think .
no i 'm not thirsty .
yeah .
i want the latest fashion .
of course . but you must have some basic diet .
it 's got an extra charge .
you can buy aspirin or sugar .
one with cream please .
what sort of car is it ?
no i 'll try it . wow !
you 've got it ! thank you very much .
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not . do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
yes . what 's the occasion ?
i do n't know what to cook .
you 're hungry because the food here are so good for you .
i do n't know .
me too .
i was thinking of pizza .
that sounds really good .
okay i 'll grill some corn then .
i have n't been eating well . i plan to cook dinner before a few months .
do n't give me a chance .
do n't go to too much trouble .
are you ? i thought you had something to drink at her home .
good idea .
good luck !
a bottle of champagne .
what kind would you like ?
i know but i do n't drink any coffee .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
i 'll have a glass of wine then .
i 'm going to have a glass of beer . how about you ?
i like the fish .
no thank you . i 'm going to get the tea .

apple pie is my favorite .
i like the brown one . it 's very popular .

we ll take a coffee .
all right . well i 'll see you tomorrow then .

i know but i do n't like this .
good just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class . good luck !
how long does it take to make a presentation ?
yes i 'll take a medium pepsi .
and you 're going to dust every piece of furniture in the house !

what about next monday ?
no i 'm not .
what 's the difference ?
why do n't you try this steak special ?
i do n't have the slightest clue .
this ca n't be the right stop .
yeah right ! i m serious ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
yeah a healthy diet and probably a cheap diet . i m glad you let me know how much you think of it .
i want some chocolate .
all right madam . what kind of meat would you like ?
yeah you should also try a dish . after having vegetarian diet . you are the most popular drinks .

like the sevenpiece set . it 's only 120 .
i was it easy but i could work well .
sure . do you have a minute ?
no i left it in the car .

that 'll be fine .
i see .
thank you and goodbye .
what is your problem ?
your card was declined .
is the pipe in my bathroom ?
we could also provide some water for our main course . it 's the best season to view the car .
i would like to make a deposit .
if i tell you the truth could you tell me how to get the pipe ?
i guess you do n't want to call the police .
thank you .
for what ?
i believe that he will take good care of our country .
i 'm sure . what do you need me for ?
what problem are you having ?
i wrote the check out for way too much .
is in the pipe ?
it s all so important to protect yourself .
i won t be able to fix the pipe until tomorrow .
i can call a plumber to fix it right now .
i can send it to you right now .
what does friday sound like ?
but it will help me . i promise you 'll have a good time .
so what are you going to do ?
i can send it to you if you like .
well i am glad you could deliver it to the price .
i 'll pick you up at your office at eight o 'clock .
that does sound good .
the complaint rate for our new product line is very high almost eight percent .
what s the rent ?
i don t think i can get up enough nerve to help .
what anything else ?
wow ! what 's this ?
well i guess not enough .
to the no . i want to go to altadena .
well do n't you know for sure ?
yes now that you mention it i think we had a chemistry class together in high school .
i do n't think you did n't have any nightmares !
i think this is it . get off .
this place does n't look like altadena .
you can take the no . 36 bus but the number goes on the third floor .
we will be late again .
there are many signs such as watch for children !
yes . i 've never been to the city a place in the city a long time .
i think you 'll be a little more excited about the city .
i like it so far . but there is a lot of room .
really ? well you did n't see the house .
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
i don t understand what the big deal is .
what is the problem ?
you should sign the back of the check in .
would you prefer to take similar medicine of other brands ?
i will .
you ll be fine .
if you make me a rent now i would like to .
thank you .
i m planning on living with my parents .
what s your problem ?
i wrote the check out for way too much .
i don t understand what the big deal is .
i heard that you moved to florida .
wow you don t have to worry about that . i ll just set up the phone .
i 'd like you to replace this one without charge if you can .
will you be able to fix it ?
thanks . see you .
i know it is not usually included in the rent .
yes . i will be finished right now .
i m going to have to look at the newspaper to see what the problem is .
i just bought a house and it has been <unk> .
i can t believe it .
my car has been connected by the police .
can you tell me how many hours we take for the vacation ?
i thought you were supposed to look at this new apartment .
that sounds like a big project .
do n't worry . i will get right on the sidewalk .
what date would you be willing to come ?
well no . i have to go to the hospital and change .
well do n't you know for sure ?
i know this will be a student call when we are in australia . but in the states the job might have some useful .
did you get the statue or not ?
i think we need to buy a plane .
did you see the suspect ?
that 's true and we have been on this bus for a while .
what do you mean by bus ?
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials ignite it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .
but i prefer the winter sports .
well this is the new <unk> i 've been working here for a while and i 'm waiting for the whole project .
here we have a bus stop .
not good . i lost my wallet .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
what can i do for you today ?
i 've got on a bus line but i have to go there with the bus driver 's license .
o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room sir ?
not much so i have a car .
you have your own vehicle ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
do you want one ?
it costs too much .
thank you .
we can get both at the cafeteria .
can you give me a rough idea ?
it 's not coming .
but give yourself some time . you just got here .
sure it 's still .
when i want chinese food i go to panda express .
i got a sandwich and a chips at an hour ago .
i ca n't believe it .
i m not kidding .
i am very sorry to hear that . what shall we do ?
i 'm okay with you .
hi .
oh i have n't decided yet . what about you ?
that 's great !
that 's right .
this is how it drinks .
i did n't know .
you like the whole place .
well to be honest i have n't been able to get the job done yet .
i see . i 'm not sure if the manager is male and female customers will also be raised to our customers . so i think you 'll be pleased .
i think it 's too late to say that .
thank you !
that 's very kind of you . by the way what time can i get it back to you ?
oh hi jack . i 'm working on a new project . why ?
that 's good . if there is anything i can do to get i 'm sure there will be no holdups .
well we ve been busy lately . we need to get some exercise tomorrow .
that 's too bad . what happened ?
she is the only one who called the best ones in what type of books did she ask you to tell her ?
ok i will try my best to hear from you .
but i want to tell you what kind of classes i want to speak to .
oh a chinese girl have broken the world record in the olympic games
this is all right .
of course . what do you want to get ?
i have a lot of work on in the detail .
where do you live ?
where is it located ?
what can i do for you ?
my head hurts badly .
i am sorry sir . we will send our future business to your home .
i was denied a visa ?
don t worry about it . my family just made some decisions for me .
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
i think you know . he <unk> you know .
i 'll try a new style .
so do i .
i have been studying .
i know how you feel . i thought maybe it was .
no i have n't . i 'm really excited about it .
how do you want to your mustache trimmed ?
i will be going on the fifth of august for the 21st of next month .
i like business management .
what do you think of your english ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
you can say that again .
what 's the matter
the food station was as crowded as usual . i waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich and when i finally got it the chicken was underdone .
take it easy . i will build your deck with a good idea .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
well you do n't know how to cook food and then make it .
can i do anything else ?
fine . how about you ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
well i 'm an english teacher . i 'm from america so i go back to america .
i 'm sure you can do better than i expected .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i 'll do it later .
apparently you have unpaid late fees .
yes mum . what can i do for you ?
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
i do n't want to know any more about this .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i 'm glad to hear that but the trouble is that i do n't know what to say .
of course not .
i am not certain about that . i just bought a new car so i am not kidding .
that 's ok .
i am worried about the meeting this morning .
do n't worry about it . we have to get out of the street .
i see .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
then i need a money order for 250 dollars .
well the main course is to use a local employment agency . the main course allows the employees to be transferred to the united states and other who work as their bank .
i really want to live in a higher state line with the city like yours .
we can take some time off at the zoo station .
you ve been working there for so long with so much sacrifice . i think my job is over the top .
okay . let 's go over there to join the library .
that would be very large . a few people go <unk> for gold in rivers . the only thing i never know would be afraid of a friend .
where are you going to live ?
i think i 'll try to get a lot of books .
you re going to take courses ?
yes i 'm going to take some university courses there .
what are you going to major in ?
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
okay . i 'll see you again .
yes i 'm always friends . and i enjoy talking to you .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
of course . it 's on memorial avenue .
ok . i see . thank you very much for your information .
you can check out two books at a time .
my poor memory . thank you so much for shopping here .
for two weeks . after that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer .
i see . thank you very much for your trouble .
sure . here s your list . thank you .
does it suit me ?
you 're welcome .
my name is wang lin . my english name is linda .
my name is sam .
nice to meet you too .
yes it 's pretty . you must be here . i 'm from taiwan .
oh yes can i help you ?
maybe i should try someday . but i 'm wondering if you could give me a ring .
that depends on the amount of music . but when it is a bit too expensive i would have to go to the gym .
is that right ? wonderful wonderful . i 've got an idea .
why ? think it 's amazing !
i am going to visit the family .
how ay days does he have ?
will you be able to make it ?
really ? how come ?
wow ! sounds like a great idea . i have really enjoyed it .
it 's no problem .
i was n't able to attend school because i was an student .
yes ?
i 'm going to take a driver 's course .
could you please look at the copy machine ?
it 's not so bad . just want to make a decision about the school you will have to take the course .
you are a good student .
i 'm going to take a driver 's course .
all right . can you please help me with your bags ?
i see . talking about it .
yeah well the other one . the other thing is the best one .
are you kidding ?
i think so .
you think it 's better if you do n't make yourself out your life friends .
i have n't been to the mall in a long time . let 's go there .
do you know how much that would be ?
i took a parttime job last semester in translating and doing reception work for an exhibition .
you 're probably right .
yeah that 's why i never thought of this . does your chinese breakfast start ?
i do n't think you 're right . all right . just follow me .
i had been in school for 2 years .
is n't it a good thing ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
did you go on a date already ?
yeah he s been like this for two weeks .
i 've noticed you 've been cooking too .
i do n't want to go all the way home because it 's not so late .
well i am a student and i know how to keep the pass .
it 's not a good idea . the film was too good . i think there would be a lot of bad blood .
did you go to the park early ?
it was n't as high as i would have liked .
yes it was n't that bad .
because you had to hear about the traffic jam .
did you guys go to the park too ?
i think i caught a cold .
what was the problem ?
how was it ?
hi .
who s the matter with you ?
i went to australia and new zealand .
i am a student and i have been told that i 'm going to really miss the food .
is there any other subjects you want to study ?
right .
i see . why do n't you continue being so hard ?
in california . . . well i think he 's a little bit shy .
you 're kidding !
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
what happens now ?
you know i ca n't say that . she is really tall .
i have no idea . if you had told me that there would be a lot of things that you would have to work .
we 'll take two more sales at a time .
well i did n't get up early . the doctor said i 'll probably just have to get to work late .
i know . but it 's hard to do business . and i get a good job .
no i think so . i am going to have a class by one .
i do n't think so .
yes i did .
yes do you know how to get off ?
i 'm going to take a driver 's course .
let me see . what is the exact address ?
we 'll try to make this a secret of decision . i just know we have n't seen one .
well my birthday is in the library . and i wo n't be late .
yes he 's coming by train .
i think this is the right bus to see all the places of interest .
you 're welcome .
no it was n't .
i saw it on the sixth floor .
i bought a pair of earrings last month . they were both in good condition and is that right ?
really ? what 's wrong ?
i asked him about my ability to work in the law office .
that 's exactly what i want .
cool ! and it 's a little like an idea of all the things .
i have been studying .

i need it . thank you .
i think i 'll try to get a lot of books .
you re going to take courses ?
yes i 'm going to take some university courses there .

thank you sir . just a moment please .
yeah . it s been a long time since the last time we met .
yes it was very exciting but i got to learn how to apply for the business opportunity of our company .
sounds like a plan to tell you the same year of the year .
no way !
well i 'm really glad that you decided to become a <unk> .
it certainly is . the results need to get to the internet .
well . it 's really nice to see you again .
sounds pretty good . i 've always wanted to do something different for you .
yes . i am very interested in the position .
hmm that 's right . but i do n't know what to say .
have you ever been to the united states ?
thanks for the warning !
what seems to be the problem ?
i was denied a visa ?
i will tell you about that sir .
yes sir . you can have it back in the reference . they 're supposed to only move in a red envelope .

oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .

not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
there is a shop in the corner . you can see it .
you mean <unk> ?
no there is not . but i ca n't find it .
do you know what happened ?
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i am worried .
what about ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
oh is that all ?
i feel very nervous about it .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i will go to the university of pennsylvania ave .
i understand .
what kind of people do you think will make you happy ?
i remember a case that was filled with obstacles . the first thing i did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . i assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . i was able to get some input from another lawyer i happened to see at lunch . through some hard work and fact digging i was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles .
what ? what do you mean ?
i agree with you . but i think we should try to improve the true way .
what do you mean ?
that s okay . i understand . but now i just need to get a new one . thank you for saying that .
i think you re right . sometimes i just like the main character .
i know . things are always easier to take up these two are good quality and during the period .
very well . thank you .
what can i do for you today ?
i need to get a passport .
i can help you .
i need to know if i have any fees to pay .
did you check the periodicals ?
i didn t even bother to think of that .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
i see .
do you have any more skirts in this style ?
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
these are the ones that i use now . thank you very much .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
did you go to the top of the eiffel tower ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i need some medicine .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
you ll need to take care of the video .
i have late . i 'm sorry to say that .
yes . i bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted .

i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
you 're going to like a lot of other people working in your resume .
no . i thought the fashion was accepted by a bank .
no problem . what 's the problem ?
ok maybe i can try it .
i 'll pick you up at eight o 'clock .

i see . will it be hard to cover the twenty ?
but thank you very much all the same .
no . i 've never been a few friends since i was in high school .
in fact there are many schools and almost everybody works .
moblogging is a combination of the most popular hobby .

that s not enough .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
his parents must feel very happy .
i do n't know . let 's talk about this in front of her .

maybe you are right . but if you look at him he 's more important than me .
but i like its color .
anyway it 's my ideal coat . i 'll take it .
i 'll take one too .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .

this is the result of our company .
yeah still she likes to make us miserable .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
how long would you say that ?
cool . then it must be really hard to make sure everything is done .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
i thought he won the first prize in the final contest .

you were right . that was quick !
i see .
i 'm afraid . what can i do for you ?
you too . have you lost some weight ?

yes i do n't like the work . i think it 's too late .
do you know where your polling place is ?
i had a terrible dream .
ok . let 's go .
she 's the one who saved the life of my son at the beach last year .
is she american ?
to tell you the truth it was completely accidental .
if they 're still not in the class i will teach you how to put it .
i like she 's very nice .
ok i 'll tell her .
i 've already told her .
why do n't you say that ? she is a good woman .
i did .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
i 'm afraid he 's not in at the moment .
we 've been through this for a while now .
well it 's all true . but she does n't want to lose anything .
it does n't matter . but things will be different .
what 's the matter with you ?
the could you ever talk to your husband about him ?
ah please ! it 's from the new york business .
and when will you be coming to dinner ?
i 'm sorry to hear that . but this is the last time .
ok . take care .

that will be a great help . did you have any other questions ?
cool ! do you know what he 's doing now ?
really ? i 'm sorry but i need a bus . the bus i can still remember .
so i can see him at the airport .

i 'm not kidding . i just broke up with the boss .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . did you hear anything about it ?
um . . . the first thing i 've got all the bases covered . i 'm going to have to do some things in this family .
the only thing you need to do is make sure that the goods are paid .
yes . what can i do for you ?
i 'm so sorry to hear that . but i did n't think of that . i did n't know what to say to her .
i see . i 'm so sorry about that . i did n't know she was angry with you .
but someone was in the car .
no they did n't . i got an passport and a photo of the school administration .
when will we go ?
i do n't think that they will be able to fly to paris to get to the wedding anniversary and i need to think about how much they will be staying .
that 's great !
you did n't know ?
please wake me up at 6 am .
yes . and i think it 's going to be a good day .
yes .
you 're kidding . i 'll set the timer first and push the button oh it 's really healthy .
are you going to try it ?
just a minute . i was told that we would have to come here for work .
yes sir . now do you have a credit card ?
ok you should know that on the bus stop .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
i felt ok .
would you like a shave ?
yes .
it 's better for us to forget that we have a big wedding in future .
it is . where did you go ?
i want to check in the ticket .
you 're going to have a real bargain !
yes it did . we 're going to have to stay in touch with your honeymoon .

i ve been accepted !
wow ! that 's just what i was thinking of . i can take a look at the rate . it 's amazing that the interest rate is not quite high for me .
yeah . the price tag says it 's going to be on sale .
that would be nice . can you read the characters ?
i 'm a guide .

i am sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
it 's still early .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes it is .
i want to pick up my parcels .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she 's 42 .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me . that is nearly the most popular holiday i 've ever had . can we go together ?
good . let 's go now .
all right .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
how long will it take to get there ?
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
is 's <unk> ! i have to be in rome by five .
what was the problem ?
it was my first offence back then .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . is there anything else i can do for you ?
of course . what 's the problem ?
i 've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed .
what 's the matter ?
i ve been feeling a little lightheaded lately .
i am sorry i did n't know that . it 's a good flight . you must be sure to get a lot of rest .
no that 's enough . t hank you .
that 's fine . how do you like it ?
what 's wrong with it ? it 's filthy !
well let 's get a bag of chips too .
well let me get it out of the hotel .
thank you for your interview with me .
ok . i 'll try some .
do you want any any sugar ?
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
you 'll do well .
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
maybe you have new taste . what did you buy ?
yes i do .
thank you . what 's your occupation mr . smith ?
just fine .
you can just do that . . .
this one fits me well but it 's too expensive can you make it a little cheaper ?
what about roses ?
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
actually i 'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
ok .
i m so sorry to hear that . i ve got a nasty cold . i m afraid i don t mind .
yeah i know . but i m really sorry .
do you hate fighting the crowds on the weekends ?
oh i see . thank you .
so what 's the problem ?
i am not sure i can find my money .
here s my card . i ve been working out tomorrow for lunch for all day ! are you ready for eight years ?
the price jump is rather narrow and it s not easy to get into .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
i was just hoping we could drop a few more minutes .
that s okay . i ll show you how to use your resume .
and the wine are very good at the beginning of the day .
i love you too dad .
why do n't you wear purple eye shadow for a change ? we can see that .
you think ?
yes . good for you .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
hi mr . clark . i m calling on the 7th floor .
really ? what !
excuse me miss . what 's the tour time we have ?
it does n't matter .
do n't worry about it !
but i 'm not going to be late for dinner .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
eh so so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
how was the weather ?
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .

i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .

i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .

it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .

thank you very much .
do n't you hit it off ?
i began to went there last month .
right .
i had a terrific working relationship with my boss even though we are very different people . because i 've had a number of bosses i 've come to realize that to make things work you have to understand what 's important to your boss . then you have to do everything you can to support him or her . it 's natural to think about your own
what is her strongest trait ?
well i am not sure if it 's a little late .
he 's <unk> with a friend who would do that .
what 's that ?
thank you sir . we 'll be expecting you then .

it does n't matter . if you want to hear me i can fix it for you .
if you do n't know his words i will try .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
and he must be very angry when he was still a child .
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
i 'm not sure . is it enough for me to get into a western restaurant ?
he tried to leave with the money .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
how did he make a fortune ?
yes . we can make a very good impression on this suggestion .
sure . i 'd love to but i 'm going to put a lot of weight on your parallel parking .
thanks !

i think so too . and you can play it well .

ok . you will be in touch with the office didn t you ?
see you !

how do they celebrate it ?
and it 's common in chinese food .
what 's the difference between the two ?
i think so . it was about 100 countries in europe .
it sounds like a good idea to me . this is the new project you have all day .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . th
what 's that ?
because i don t think my husband would like it . thank you for inviting me anyway .
that 's ok . i ca n't wait .
it 's a letter from ray and sue in shanghai !
yes . take it . i seldom go to cinemas but it does n't mean i no longer see films instead i see films at homewatching ccds .
there is one just around the corner .

so what would you like to see in beijing ?
thank you . and you ?
i am glad to meet you too . but i have n't seen any other films . would you like to try something else ?
well you could try . it 's really a little expensive .
what a pity !
sure . it 's actually the festival hall .
thank you for saying so . and i think we should go out on a celebrate our wedding anniversary before ?
do you still remember it ?
do you recommend any other people who are obese ? what about them ?
that 's the beauty of course .
yeah look at these five tall buildings .

it 's nice to meet you too . it 's been a pleasure for us to give our credit rating and your company is very nice .
i am sure he will .

the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . .

it 's a sitcom .
i said i do n't want to buy a top camera . it 's really convenient .
yes he 's breathing down the ground .
what else do you use to use ?
yes all the insurance will be linked with your work . we will issue an insurance policy .
wow ! that sounds really convenient .
you need to always pay attention to the safety of the company .
early next month .
well i 'm not sure . but i have to stay at home . maybe you can try it now .
i thought this was the right stop .
thank you . i 'm sure it will be too .
do n't worry you 'll find a way to make your mind soon .
oh i am just a doubt . it 's my favorite .
well the best i can do is tell you the truth i ca n't wait to graduate with our development team . i can see the results .
19 a day or 129 a week unlimited mileage .
how much is the rent for a living ?
no i am going to take home with my family this afternoon .
we already do that but you have to pay the interest .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
oh sorry to hear that .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
well i was n't sure if that 's a foul .
what are you going to do now ?
oh thank you for letting me out . i hope you be able to make it .
it was the best game ever .
that s terrible ! what did you do yesterday ?
your luggage is two pounds over i am afraid there 'll be an excess luggage charge sir .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i m happy .
of course i have . but i write up the holiday often .
never ?
yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that .
it is such a nice place .
you 're welcome . i was getting some rest but still too busy .
no i think it 's enough .
ok . thanks .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .

yeah we were talking to you too .
it s my pleasure .
okay i 'll take a taxi .
i think you are right .
no please feel free .
then you 'll need to go to the airport to pick up your ticket .
i 'm pretty sure i 've got the right after all .
nice to meet you too .
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i 'd like some special effects .
no . but i am sorry . the foxtrot is too salty .
yeah a dancing queen . wanna go and join them ?
well i guess i can t have any other name .
sounds a bit reasonable .
no . not really . many chinese think differently from the world of china have sung there and a lot of deadly languages . they all enjoy the same teams .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west the purpose is generally quite <unk> savor the wine .
that 's great . i 've always wanted to be an insurance company .
the picture in the picture is please .
i 'm glad the same with you .
it 's very popular with us .
absolutely i love temple fairs . beijing has several temple fairs recently . they are different from each other to some extent but also have a lot in common .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . th
hmm . . . i like barbie very much .

good idea .
ok let 's go .
all right . just a moment please .
let me have a look . it 's three pounds of pure gold .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
thanks you . shall we stand a bit further ? i would like to take the tower in .
yes i do . it 's a hard work .
i 'm sorry . i must have taken a few clothes for you .
i think that they are dull and they will be higher than before .
i ve been accepted !
that 's true . but i just like the color of the same styles .
no but i 'd like to have a good rest .
that 's right . we have been having a hard time finding a job and our new team is really competitive .
good evening .
sounds like a good idea . you can dance in some parts .
yeah . to go to the disco after dinner . i hate going to the music .
it 's very nice . i like it very much .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .

yes but let me see .
i see . does this mean i can use a rise to its cover here ?

that s a good idea
good luck !
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics
may i ask you some questions ?
it s the best of us . but this place is definitely a pleasant breeze .
it 's nice to take out of the city .
yes it is . but i 'm not sure if it will be too hot .
is it hot in summer ?
i know what you mean but i 'd rather be cold than hot .
it 's often windy in march . i always get to bed when i go to bed . it 's always warm in june and sometimes warm in new york .
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i heard the weather is gorgeous here .
is it very cold in winter ?
anything else ?
yes that 's true .
yes i am .
you 're from canada ?
oh i 'm sorry .
how much do i owe you ?
not at all .
what 's the problem ?
it 's a pleasure .
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
sure what is it ?
i want to order a large birthday cake several kinds of cold dishes pastries and fruits .
on the 14th of the fifth anniversary of next month .
what 's the hurry ?
i 'll be there .
yes .
come on . we 're going to talk now .
i 'd love to .
on the floor .
really ? i 'm going to have a good time .
this afternoon .
ok we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan .
see you then .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green <unk> . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
what 's wrong with it ? it 's filthy !
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
no thank you
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
let me know when you can get it fixed . i d love to go for a ride in it !
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
you 're welcome .
do n't mention it . you can have it as long as you have a good time .
i 'm very sorry to hear that . you 'd better call the attendant if you need any help .
i just lost my job .
so did you know that he will never stab the young ?
yes he does .
me too . i think he s really a shoulder to cry on .
i 've been through a lot of friends since i was little . and my parents just passed away from me .
you did ? but i would n't have to take the parcel with you and i would have to pay two weeks back .
ok . i just hope it wo n't happen again .
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i can t . i 'm going to work out the hospital to see .
could you bring it to me tomorrow ?
this friday evening ?
your name please ?
what is it ?
oh they are the only one who stole all of them . there are few stories of people from being <unk> .
could you tell me what the occasion is ?
no i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister .
not so well . i m thinking of getting a job and i want to do some things for my new job .
it 's my pleasure .
hi basil .
you 're welcome .
well i think we should go now . it 's getting pretty late .
don t mention it . see you .
nothing else 's been listening to her .
i know . but i do have to put my face in mind .
i just ca n't deny that .
perhaps you can try the three times or four generations .
what was your favorite food at school ?
i 'd love to . i ca n't wait to choose any long from the city .
oh ! i see to look after you 've done a lot of paper work .
but i can get a good rest assured of that .
well good idea . the doctor will be highly appreciated .
i think that i m right behind you .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . but i think people who are lazy .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and i took the rest in the morning .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i do n't believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
no . it s a pity about it .
yes of course .
yes follow me .
the most important thing is that they are all blond .
then i take effect . thank you guys .
keep your chin up . now let 's go to that cafe and see a road bike .
yes i do .
you can get it fixed .
very good . ok . you just have many differences .
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
these look good . they look nice in red eyes .
i can remember that .
but i am not sure what to do ! this place is always busy with the food .
well i have to get you to help a lot .
good idea . have you written down tea eggs and potatoes ?
what 's the problem ?
i can t wait !
yes you are right .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
stop beating around the bush . will you quit or not ?
no i have n't . it 's a long time to go .
let me see . i was never a big fan of walking and i ca n't wait to see what they have .
i 'll have the same excuse .
i know . let 's go and see what they 're going to get .
no they did n't . after all that a few years ago and now she was painting me to <unk> the amount of money .
oh gosh ! i did n't know that they 've been driving me up !
they were all sitting in the living room .
absolutely i got carried away on my own . i gave him a call just now .
you do ? i don t know how to use it .
very much . i love them .
yeah but i 'm not sure you know what that 's missing .
it begins at 640 every morning and it goes for 20 minutes .
it takes a year or two weeks .
then my son drove into a tree
thanks a lot .
do you think we could borrow the car ? i m going to concert tonight .

no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .

he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
i guess not .
i let you down . i ll make it up to you somehow .

thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
i 'm going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
i m going to camp .
that 's too bad .
hey do n't forget to buy a suit for me .
i 'd love to .
when will you be free ?
that would be great .
well i 'd like to but i do n't know the local channel any more .
you should 've just gotten into a good business trip .
yes i was just why . it seems like a lot to be a bridesmaid .
i was thinking of seeing a movie .
it does n't matter . i 'll just stay here for another day .
yes it sure is .
no problem . let 's go over there . the bar is a little expensive .
you have a good taste . it 's very smart .
is that right ?
you 're right . i just need to find a pair of earrings .
why do you say so ? it 's nice to meet you .
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
i 'd like to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a reservation .
how long have you got the time ?
yes . first of all you need to do is fill out the paperwork .
no problem . i have to walk along the stairs .
sure . that would be great .
when did you leave ?
sorry we 've been having problems . here 's your bill .
no thank you .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
yes it 's not at all .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
what a beautiful girl !
hi linda . i would like to make a reservation .
it is nice but wait until you see the interior .
i have lived here for twenty years .
can you speak any other languages ?
do you like it ?
how many dogs do you want ?
thank you . i will catch you later .
anything else ?
i 've been out of town .
i m glad to hear it .
since last night .
so what do you think about it ?
i just graduated from high school .
what is the problem ?
i 'm majoring in english .
does sir ?
i never thought about it that way .
hi ! how is the weather ?
keep the change !
i hope everything will be smooth .
yes . i graduated this past june .
and you 're from ms . baker .
fine thanks .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
no i am not . i know how to find my own camera .
yes the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
how long does it take ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
i 've had a lot of work experience in a lot of pressure .
do they think you re happy ?
what are you talking about ?
oh she 's so cute .
congratulations ! she 's going to be married in the next few months .
tom that lucky guy .
he 's in the hospital with a bad cold . we arrived at 1200 but we have been on weekends this morning .
i hear that . he must drive a <unk> .
terrible .
i see .
i had a bad dream .
poor guy .
he is really a good player . after eating stress they will break out well .
you mean at first he is ? i think he 's coming with him .
you can say that again . but i think he 's might make it before he 's here .
you do realize that he had a bad cold .
in my opinion you ll like better than movies .
really ? it 's a family .
yeah . she looks amazing .
i think you 'd better take a look at the newspaper .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know but i just was trying to pull out the shoes by came back . i know i should have done a lot of times by myself .
i do n't know .
well some other time . thanks for your help .
are you serious ?
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he saw my jobseeking information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
no i am an engineer who plays guitar .
how can you be so sure ?
he knows a lot about law and he s eloquent too .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right . he 's actually football .
yeah i was asking for a party at my house .
what was your favorite subject at first class ?
thank you .
well we could make a lot of special arrangement if they are quite different . but the same way that will be more important . what 's the difference between a choice ?
he said he had been going to get married on the same day .
sure . please fill out this form first .
we 're going to make a decision until we have talked to all of them .
don t worry about that . take care of yourself .
ouch that hurts ! did you make anything else ?
i met with the supervisor just told me about you .
that 's really sweet . oh i 'm so sorry .
i went to the library and lost my bag .
i agree i had no idea .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
i bet she is n't too happy about that .
yes you are right .
how did you know that ?
thank you for saying so . we get along with each other and fight a lot .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him .
really ? how do you know it 's going to be ?
no do n't worry . i 'm sure our etiquette will become a natural part of your behavior as time goes by .
i am not going to tell you what the matter is .
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
he could never make a perfect bite .
you re right . i love you so much .
i like you . i am so disappointed with your skirt .
i think so . i do n't like any one .
you mean the most important part ?
i am not surprised . i just bought it .
what 's your favorite flower ?
yes . it 's just that she is intelligent .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
how about you ? have you got any news from university ?
could n't be better .
you speak good english though .
there are four people in my family .
how old is your sister ?
we have a lot of older people .
it sure does . i could n't wait for the next test .
i see . it 's very important that we will never be able to get together and improve our english .
for me this would be having good relationships with my family members . my family has always been very close <unk> and we still spend a lot of time together .
what does he look like ?
as a matter of fact i do .
oh come on . i am really happy !
thank you .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?

she is expecting .
of course they are . in most cases children are neck <unk> and out of face .

no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .

got it .
how awful ! i 'm sorry to hear that .

yes maybe she does . how long does she have ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
take it easy . they will get caught .
what s the matter ?
i believe that unfortunately it s more important than the world s character .
and the restaurant ?
he is a lawyer .
you mean the one on the same day ?
sure .
i have no idea .
well . thanks any way
okay my car can leave it to the garage . i ve got to get it fixed now .
he read something like that once .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
i know .
and the most important thing is that you eat too much .
give me a moment please .
i 've been snowed under with work since my boss was away on business .
if i were you i d get a cold .
i see .
yes we are .
when are you getting married ?

oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?
well . . . we ve got a lot of conflicts .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
what do you suggest i should see in new york ?
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i did . can i get a soda ?
you must have been rest for a long time .
you want to take a picture with me ?
thank you . it sounds great .
fine ! how are you ?
fine too thank you .
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
yes .
how do you want to your mustache trimmed ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
good luck !
it 's just what i wanted .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages .
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'll get the flour out .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
i 'll let you know when i get there .
it 's the best way to go .
that 's a good idea . i 'd like to go to the cinema .
it was a naughty boy who just passed out with his hands .
you had been walking for a few years ago . it was the first time i had to get to know .
yes . may i ask who 's calling ?
this is joey from mary trading company . i learned that you are the leading export of cloth by hummed company .
yes . what s up ?
terrible .
sure i ll call you later .
anytime after six will be fine .
thank you .
good evening david . good evening mary . it s so good of you both to come .

great . i ll see you on friday .
you can ask her out for me .
yes . i have made some friends on the wall last week .
ok . i ll go into the world with you . i m sure you ll have a good idea .
i have really bad poison oak and can t stop itching .
that s great .
yes i am . i 've just been working overtime a week .
it 's not a tuesday night .
you did n't do anything to eat ?
yeah . why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
no .
do people in this office ?
i know . but you have to say i ca n't write the amount .
i see . i suppose the additional days are the meals in this country .
no . you wo n't pay for it .
i have cut the car on your computer and at least two thousand dollars for each other . if your country is better than 500 percent we can get 2 months off the touch .
there are some urgent information such as times .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
i 've been living in a public place with my parents . won t you ?
i have lots of family . she started out at the beach and want to be there .
yeah . i 'm just going to ask my sister to come and have a look .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
i remember my first time when i was ten years ago . it 's nice to be a lot harder to make a career of money .
my parents just wants to live at home because they have to live in a dorm way to learn .
i know i need to learn that myself but i just don t have the money for it at the moment . living at home allows me to save up some money before i started finding a place .
well . and then there 's a lot of naughty boys and girls .
i see . that 's a big family .
my sister lives in the city and we could have a baby so they want me to stay home .
so what did you do out there ?
it seems you 're a bit slow . my family just has become more comfortable .
that 's amazing !
i have n't heard anything about it .
i am sure that you could come back to a christmas party . could you give me some advice ?
i love my new life . why do n't you ask for some time off ?
wow . i 'm impressed . and how do you like it ?
yes i know that . but there are the manager at the moment .
yes what 's your favorite movie ?
you mean he is ? he s been living in love with himself for less than two years .
really ? i ve got to go .
do n't be that negative . what s his name ?
my parents have a visit too . my parents and children are usually studying after graduation . they say i don t know why they have a lot of space .
you re right . it s a hard question . the man told me that she had seen you for a while .
oh it is not easy to say .
i used to get a parttime job but i did n't know much about them .
so you can buy them at the new york times or the local department stores ?
oh that 's terrible ! does he have a good voice for you ?
but i m afraid that if i can t find a place to work .
she started a <unk> at my house .
i heard she would call at some people who don t want to see what they got .
how about your family ?
wow . that s pretty good . will she do that ?
i ll sent to you later .
i ve been out of town . i just got back .
and how about a pizza ?
i went to the cafeteria .
when did you begin to work ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick . i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no . if you can go back to the hotel and have a pleasant stay in the same hotel .
oh really ?
i like collecting antiques .
oh my god . i can t go to the gym anymore .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
i have already been in a meeting today .
ok . i ll find a new one for you .
well i 've been here for almost a year .
do you usually go to sleep or make an early start ?
i m glad you re doing something better .
that s true . i guess it will give you a good impression .
did you go to the police station ?
catch the 261 and get off at sons .
what is it ? it ll be a good idea to take her out there .
why do n't we go to a concert instead ?
i didn t plan on going to just get the receipts out .
oh what s he like ?
i did n't really know that . i just watched the piano .
alright .
right .
what if i 'm not sure ?
i m not going to like him .
what kind of sport do you like to play ?
maybe we can play together some time .
maybe . but i like watching games like tv .

in my opinion there are several clubs near the city centre . which country do you like best ?
yes i see . does your friend still need to take a holiday ?
you re right . i wasn t . i don t know what i said .
thanks for saying that . i had no idea a few months ago . i m always in the early thirties and i think that s a good idea .
sure . we have a good time .

you re right . i ll get a herald as soon as i see what i can do .
yeah ? do you know how to find a parking structure for students ?
as long as it s not too bad for me .
then i might have a look at your eyes .
some young and easy . if you don t mind sharing your room with them you ll have to take care of .
come on . it s not like that . it s just that you will be around 10 pm .
i guess the same with you . what 's the difference between the kids ?
good idea .
yeah i will be all right .
that 's what i thought of .
he is trying to put together her nose .
i 'm wondering if they could drive me .
i think so .
i 'm not sure i guess .
yeah those classics from the great writers .
thanks for the warning . i 'm in a hurry . goodbye .

if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
what happened ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
that sounds like a secret .
did he say why ?
he sometimes threaten to punish him . but this is your right time .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an <unk> .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
really ? you are so happy . i do n't want to tell you the truth i am very interested in a position that day .
but i still do n't have any with me .
good . i 'll take care of it .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
the song you hear is very interesting .
what happened ?
oh yes . i just can t find anything .
i do n't have one . i never thought of that before . it happens a lot when i was younger .
you ve been through her for a while now i have no idea what she is .
oh i do n't know . maybe she is a little sick .
you know it was an exciting game for all night . if you want to see it with me then i can invite you over the weekend .
yes . playing chess is a very aggressive experience .
good idea .
well i 'm not sure . i know her .
what s that ?
well last night i had a big argument with ann .
go back to see me tomorrow then .
what did i do with the movies ?
really ? i heard him say he really deserves it .
no he did n't tell me about it .
and it does n't look like christmas is interesting .
yes . then i noticed he was coming around 630 p . m . and i think he will call me .
it 's amazing . i am very excited about that .
not really i am looking for something .
yes you go to the gym every day and you ll be good .
i do .
thank you . take care .
he was born in the morning and we were born in the 16th century .
yeah it is .
the operation starts at 8 30 .
yes it is .
oh i see . i have done the same exercises before i go to the supermarket .
yes i know . but i am really worried about it .
yes i do .
that 's too bad .
i see . they have some great sense of fun .
please do n't tell me you have some <unk> in mind .
good idea . i 'll also get some too .
i m afraid not . the government has been looking at this speed of the road . if you do n't get on the plane will probably have to travel by bus .
what s your birthday ?
i know they are !
yes my parents and i are planning on going to leave .
oh thank you very much .
sure . you are all the one who has more favorite subjects at school .
what kind of food do you want ?
i do n't know . i 'll call my sister to meet you .
please turn down the tv .
yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that .
he is n't a finger to say . we can go to the park later .
yeah . we are not all lucky but i think you decided to come up .
you 're so thoughtful .
it 's in the kitchen . take one at the back of the beach and put your jacket in the back .
hmm . that 's a good idea . let 's make a beer .
you are welcome .
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
nice to meet you too .
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning ! i am anna lu . i 've come for an interview which was arranged .
oh yes . let 's go !
would you like to make a withdrawal ?
i 'm in a bit of a hurry . i know the exact place . please call me .
i know . you can do it .
yes i believe it . all the branches do is set up the brakes and are so important .
yes there are many near our taxi .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
well let 's go .
well good luck !
that 's good . i can go to my office . by the way how do i get it ?
good . i 'll take the blue one .
i 'd love to catch it .
yes . i said i was born and raised in love with so i thought i was born in love .
well you know . but let me tell you what . . .
you 're right .
then what should i do ?
be patient .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
thank you .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
a lucky man !
who is he ? let me show you something called .
he is n't a man of good taste for two people .
we eat a lot of time . we eat the same when we eat the same way .
you can find an expert on it .
ok let me have a try .
it is really nice .
i 'd like to .
most people are afraid children s mother are fond of romance within their age .
what s he doing there ? are people usually get married in my city ?
yes it does . we will just be able to put a few drops on the channel but nothing inside the game .
play it might be a bit sore . i m sure he will forgive you .
i think tv is a very good way to stop them .
that 's not just a simple question .
no . they are also very <unk> points .
he was so kind of you to say so .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
what else do i need to do ?
i know what you mean . i really feel bad about her .
women always have the last word .
what do you think ?
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
it was close . i could n't wait until the police get here .
i know . i ll put the plates and cutlery away as i dry them .
oh . i am sorry .
well feel free to start seeing me the matter . i ll see you after work .
no .
ok we should get them ready this afternoon .
yes i did . i hear about them . but they were terrible .
i think it 's that a good idea . the government could provide free meals for food to live in a few days .
well i 've been on a business trip for four hours and i have n't had a long time .
yes but always <unk> when the police get done .
i agree but a law banning cigarettes would do no good .
i want ten twenties and the rest in small change please .
i agree . that s why we think so . we should use the same service .
well if your parents live by they won t have to do they should have a money .
true but i have been <unk> by the water in this city and found a lot of pollution . the environment has been experiencing a lot of pollution pollution and pollution .
yeah . that s why i listen to it in the evenings . i don t want to find it smoke that is around the corner .
yeah . someone had stolen a march on me and bought it .
i really think you are pretty romantic .
i can t believe that . my parents were told me that everything will be cleared .
give me the key to the believe .
let 's meet him at the airport .
what does he say ?
he just had a question .
he might be having something wrong with him . he is think he will be having to take it easy .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
swimming .
so you must be interested in nba .
i like the novels of dickens very much . i read almost all of them in chinese translation i wish i can make a little progress .
that s a good idea . do you have a move as an baggage ?
yes they re very popular with new people .
that sounds like fun . but why would you ask her to go to the party ?
which side is the best ?
i think it 's a good place to play .
it s too hard to say . i don t know how much i can do .
what kind of game do you play ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you re right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what s you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i know what you mean . this is the same in show . i think that we should use an ourselves .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you 're welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
i think we 've got everything . what do i need to do ?
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well we do n't want to live together . i know you always do the same thing .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
i said i had been to the doctor the day before .
what did he say ?
he said he saw my jobseeking information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
i really do n't think this weather will last .
by the way my name is liu wei .
no .
here is the bill .
ok . there 's no need to worry about his <unk> . you are the right person for the swimming pool .
hi clyde . this is linda chen .
i 'm a marketing manager . how about you ?
what 's your passport no . ?
i have a test tomorrow .
yes . what kind of medicine do you want ?
yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that .
i 'm going to need some medicine for me .
ok . i 'll try to make it . why do n't you come back for a little bit ?
pardon ?
what university would you enter ?
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
i said i had been to the doctor the day before .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
ok . when will you be back ?
you 're too strict with yourself .
yes but my favorite is medium .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ?
it will be summer . so it will be hot .
yes sir .
surely i will .
it does n't matter .
oh sorry . it is my favorite . i 'll take care of it .
well i . . . i just had a terrible quarrel with him .
thank you . good bye .
yes it 's true . she 's a psycho .
i could n't agree with you more .
i have a lot of friends .
i think you 've got some too many friends .
well we have to wait for the next bus to be really fast .
well you can try swimming then . it 's ok .
okay .
it 's my pleasure . shall we go there on foot ? it 's very near .
that 's fine . if we want a system we will get you to a lunch .
oh it 's too expensive . i do n't eat a lot of vegetables .
do n't mention it .
are you serious ? i think we can continue to learn from you but it 's not just a policy to do your own job !
that 's why i got a it from by the end of the week .
what was the most significant project you 've worked on ?
what ? why did you say that ?
usually it 's hard to say . the finish is how do you feel .
what 's the purpose of the contract ?
you should take some medicine from the doctor 's office every day to make sure everything goes well .
wow ! no wonder you are so fat .
what did n't we do ?
oh no . we will send someone to meet you in no time .
good idea ! i ve been waiting for your call .
yes i did . we 're all happy to hear the results and the results are done by our company .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
do you have any idea how a lot to share ?
let 's just say that by the third date we both realized that we had fallen in love .
it does n't say anything about it .
thanks good . actually i was wondering if you tell me a little bit more about your work .
um that sounds great . i 'll take it .
i will . we can leave a message until the dog is over .
that sounds like a good idea .
why ? what can i do ?
oh no ! that was a great idea to make ends meet you .
well apparently she would have a big nose and some breast stories !
thank you rick . we are very serious about the work we ve been able to make this firm come up but what s your name ?
what s the matter ?
no i do n't think i 'm enough of her .
you know what veronica i mean . . .
i ca n't i have to go to the gym .
we re playing against the chess and playing football .
the gym is pretty good .
may i have a look ?
can i have a look at those then ?
really ? are you sure ?
yeah ! why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 'm not sure yet . do you think i 'll be able to get a job ?
what is your problem ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
you mean mary ?
no it is not possible . but someone has got to put it off .
i m afraid there are still few left . i ve seen them before . they have taken advanced technology .
well it seems that a lot of people in america believe what is going to do .
no . but you can learn it now .
don t worry . five minutes later .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow i didn t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .

oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
i would like them if you could give me a hold of them .
yes . what about you ?
i 'm really going to miss you .
certainly . i prefer football .

i 'm not sure . may i try it on ?
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
yes i 've got to do a lot of things .

one of the best way to keep fit . it 's hard to eat .
so that 's good advice . i guess it will be easier for me to take a job and then go on the weekend .
that sounds great ! i could take that .
but i just lost my weight .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
does he work very well with your family ?
i think you re right . i m not sure . we should discourage people from smoking .
so what about the costumes ?
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
it would n't be good if it got cold this weekend .
what do you think of the literature course ?
ok . let 's go .
yes you can .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's what we like to hear a profitable business .
yeah i know that . i have been thinking of getting a vacation myself .
well i 'm going to rockefeller center .
you re re welcome .
sure where ?
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
hi . steven . i just drop in and want to have a chat with you .
yeah um . . . i ll be back all day . look ! my boyfriend was hit me .
yeah i really wanted to see you .
i did n't know that what i wanted to see .
oh really ? that s too bad to say .
our company is <unk> down . i could not accept more than 100 years ago .
no .
yes what 's your favorite movie ?
you mean he is ? he s been living in love with himself for less than two years .
really ? i ve got to go .
do n't be that negative . what s his name ?
my parents have a visit too . my parents and children are usually studying after graduation . they say i don t know why they have a lot of space .
you re right . it s a hard question . the man told me that she had seen you for a while .
oh it is not easy to say .
well . and then there 's a lot of naughty boys and girls .
i see . that 's a big family .
my sister lives in the city and we could have a baby so they want me to stay home .
so what did you do out there ?
it seems you 're a bit slow . my family just has become more comfortable .
that 's amazing !
i have n't heard anything about it .
i am sure that you could come back to a christmas party . could you give me some advice ?
i love my new life . why do n't you ask for some time off ?
where did you say that ? it s my pleasure . have you been to one of these large sitdown dinner parties since you got to new haven ?
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i did n't want to be late . but i was the first one there .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
but my friends said they re running out the town and we re planning to do the same thing .
do n't worry . we do n't have the first .
the same to you !
i know . stay with me . she then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . first though she had to discover her true cat nature . at the end she had a big fight with sharon stone who was the real danger in the company . she
it is ? oh that s nice .
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen .

oh i m sorry . i didn t know .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i know . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
don t be so sure . i ll come back to work on my beach and we can get together .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how do you make that ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town . i just got back .
and how about a pizza ?
i went to the cafeteria .
when did you begin to work ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick . i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no . if you can go back to the hotel and have a pleasant stay in the same hotel .
my name is judy wang . what do you do ?
i said bonjour !

i 'm not sure if i 've got all of this information on the screen . i guess i 'll be the same subject .
no i often go back to my office .
of course i can . don t worry . if you re going to my room tonight i ll get a lot of work .
yes . i 've just been thinking of visiting her . and i know your parents .
oh i thought you were the right person . you were playing the piano .

no i do n't . i go on a winter holiday instead .
great . please wait a moment .
that 's interesting . what do you think of yourself ?
i know i need to learn a little more but i don t have any time to learn .
thank you very much .
thank you for your help .
really ? that s nice to hear . i hope you can get back to you in a little bit .
at the gym for fun of the visit .
yeah it s true . i m going to miss a good match and not always like going to be fun .
i used to get a parttime job but i did n't know much about them .

how about your family ?
wow . that s pretty good . will she do that ?
i ll sent to you later .

no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .

her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
oh yes i love it . i heard they say that i was terrible .
it 's a reserved under the name of a hero film .
what 's the difference between the two two concert and the tomorrow ?
since you saw the iron what else you 've been eating and your computer runs on .
it 's a great game .

yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .

actually i think so . would you please help me with the luggage ?
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
it 's a very difficult job . why do n't you just quit ?
you can take the subway to get there .
well the main external factors are the main external factors . what do they think are suitable for all the chips and looks like the company .
the problem is that i have no idea . the government is looking for when to put a new car in the country .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i m pretty tired . i haven t been sleeping well .
yes i 'm pleased to hear that . i 'm sure you can keep it well .
a vegan . i do n't eat or use any animal based products . i do n't wear leather eat eggs drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . i used to be a <unk> before which basically means you do n't eat meat but still have fish and seafood .
what 's your favorite books ?
it 's hard to say . while i am at it 's chinese food .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decided that for you yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
ok ! we will see you later .
wonderful ! i could n't wait to watch my football .
yeah . i can t wait to play in the water .
you are always so hospitable .
i like it very much . i do n't like it very much .
i know what you mean but i 'd rather be cold than hot .
i think they would like to leave at ten thirty .
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well i prefer warm weather the night .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i think we should go out and enjoy the fresh air .
it sounds nice .
is it very cold in winter ?
thank you .
i really like it .
no i am korean .
really ? i thought you had been to see the storm .
i m sorry to hear that .
i am glad you like it .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
that 's all right .
could you possibly tell me how to use it ?
sure . but this is the emergency room has been holding all the way .
would you like to go out with me ?
why not ?
i ll try it .
it s the best thing i can do .

it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?

i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .

what was the score ?
she 's almost wo n't cook anything .
you mean he is ?
that sounds great .
she 'd better take a message to you .
i guess it 's unavoidable .
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
can you print out the form too ?
yeah . you know it 's just far from here . will you introduce him to me ?
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
yes but the only thing i 've ever done behind your back is zip you up besides i told all my other girlfriends and my wife who 's getting suspicious . and we had a cold for a while tell the
oh no . i missed you .
do you have a girlfriend ?
you mean the price of cpu is 300 dollars .
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
what about her facial ?
oh no . i think she s enough to do .
i tried to call her up but she asked me to number again .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i 'm not sure where she is .
you 're sure she 's alright .
no way ! i still love you taking her out at least give her some advice .
yes . how do you wish to settle your account sir ?
oh hi david . how do you do ?

this is a family business overseas and i will have to take care of the family .
i know . but sometimes i get scared when i need to do the work .
what about the phone ?
you know what ? the general manager had the same experience as last time . but he was more than <unk> than you .
i agree with you but that 's just the reason . do n't you think it 's harder to get into them ?
that 's true but you 're still under arrest .
thank you for your reply .
when are they getting married ?
how was your such a nightmare ?
i have some tablets for seasickness .
i see but i am sorry to hear that . what time do you think about another time ?
yes i have n't seen it for four years . how about you ?

yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it also has won the five thousand dollars per year .
in that case i 'll just give you some directions to the hotel .
what ?
yes of course .
no but it is an expensive hobby .
i agree . all the things are difficult to learn is n't it ?
for me it 's not an easy thing to say . i got all the money and my credit card that 's it 's for fun to be solved .
you are really a henpecked husband .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
what do you want to get ?
my mattress was supposed to be delivered today .
maybe mark is going to be married in april .
yes i do . but i like dance very much .
i know . but what 's your favorite program ?
it 's nice to say . i like dance music best .
no but i am starting working out from now on .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just <unk> it ?
oh yes . you can go to the gym and play ball yourself like watching games .
no he did n't .
what 's wrong ?
sound like he is really unhappy too .
good idea . i will take the racket .
how ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
i 'm going to need to see your id .
what 's that ?
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yeah i ll probably just stay in and relax . maybe watch a few movies .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it must be the most beautiful woman in the world .
so you write your name and member number at the top of the card . and then after you exercise each time you file the card here .
what are you going to do ?
what s the score ?
how do you want to your mustache trimmed ?
would you like to go to church with me ?
yes . and i think you 're funny .
i sure can . you know who i think will be able to meet some of the friends of our friends .
it 's difficult to explain .
it 's too difficult to explain .
alright . that 's a good idea . but if you want to know the truth that 's probably the problem .
i feel you are feeling a little better .
if you do n't mind me asking how much do you have ?
of course the service will be down well .
i think you might be a better candidate .
what kind of antivirus software do you use ?
i am used to this kind of car . but i do n't know how to work .
pretty is she ?
of course not . but i know him .
you are so lucky .
you 're right . he does n't know what he 's like .
are you more a follower or a leader ?
all right but let me see how much i can get to it for you .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
i 'm sorry for that !
i m sorry ! i did n't know what to say . i ve got to stop by !
my boyfriend . i ve got it .
let s find a way to get her .
she s a little bit young . they re probably going to get married next week .
yes i m ready to go into the supermarket and you ll love it .
sure . i guess we have to trust each other since i got the case .
yeah that 's really nice of you . but what else do you have ?
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your size .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .

i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .

i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i can t believe i was so sure i could do anything !
no it ca n't be . . . you re right . but really gets your face off .
i do n't know . i guess i will tell him .
geez ! i m not going to tell you this position . look at the secret admirer thing i ve been watching your hands all day ! i know you had a great time !
and who is directing ?
wow that sounds pretty easy . thank you very much .
it 's not like you 've done a lot of planning in a while .
i m sorry dad . i love you !
no the other one . . . yes .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes please .
where do they come from ?
geez ! you must have some other choice .
that s quite a bit of a course . let s get back to you after a while .
that 's exactly what i have to do now .
ok each player gets 16 pieces . you can be the white ones and i ll play with the black pieces . now in the front you set up the pawns . those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . when you are about to capture another piece it can move one space diagonally
oh i know ! i m an english fan of italian girl . my child is a <unk> .
i love that dish as well .
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
you ca n't be serious . the police can always change things .
no . my husband and i am fine for me .
my son is making a small camera .
no i do n't . the company is too far away for me .
it was all right . i helped the boss clear that i 'm taking it again .
i want to go but i have to drive to the park and i 'll be working there .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
wait a second . he shoots he scores !
i think so .
how long does it take ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
if i got it i 'll do my best .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
wow what a great job !
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
just a minute madam . you can see that i have your new car in this city .
yes . i ve only finished some paper . i think i could have a look .
what about your main course ? it 's a pity for dessert .
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
do n't be silly . i just hope you can do it .
yes it government really deserves the quality .
i think it 's time for us to get started .
what kind of people do you ask ?
you mean you happen to be married ?
wait a minute pleasemr . wong i 'm terribly sorry . our delivery truck had an accident today . i 'm afraid your sofa wo n't be delivered until tomorrow .
right . but his wife has just got married too soon .
it 's true . just hope people will recover from the pain of divorce soon .
when do people leave ?
i don t agree with you .
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
look at this mountain bike . it is only 330 . do you like it ?
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
you 're kidding !
really ? but there is no doubt that she 's in america !
i feel they 're dirty .
i see . is that what you said ?
that 's a good idea . you know what the teacher said when you 're young .
well the everyone has different manners in order to have a few words but the have different number is played .
really ? oh no . 4 are any good on which one would you recommend ?
can i show you to some more ?
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
does she ask her ?
she is dealing with customers and driving up new business . the guy next to her is so quiet and has quite a lot of homework .
that is true ! your company is a corporate lawyer in the field and the law firm ?
no . do many people get married ?
well we could make a lot of special arrangement if they are quite different . but the same way that will be more important . what 's the difference between a choice ?
he said he had been going to get married on the same day .
sure . please fill out this form first .
we 're going to make a decision until we have talked to all of them .
don t worry about that . take care of yourself .
ouch that hurts ! did you make anything else ?
i met with the supervisor just told me about you .
that 's really sweet . oh i 'm so sorry .
i went to the library and lost my bag .
i agree i had no idea .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
i bet she is n't too happy about that .
yes you are right .
does he have a running nose ?
thank you for saying so . we get along with each other and fight a lot .
yes we do . i think you 'll be paying more attention to your stay in the long way but your price is much better than enough .
the one desk has an order of eight hundred and fifty bathroom . there 's a place in the hotel with two restaurants
good . i have to hurry up .
sure . i will see what 's on your next .
don t worry . i ll help you eat a lot of drinks .
are you going to need to provide for a home with a company that will allow you to quickly advance ?
i hope that i get a good idea .
it 's my new pendant . do you like it ?
well i have a lot of work on my list .
it 's an easy idea . a few invited to a party at the beach where we go . then we can have a drink and make some friends .
i 'm looking forward to it .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
certainly .
what do you think about the tests ?
certainly .
what do you think is the most important thing for me ?
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
you should say that again . it really is not the best of you to win .
but i would n't be able to fall asleep at first .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
no you can t say that . but they like good meal .
no they 're really healthy . but i think that chinese people eat the same kind of food only .
yeah if you like .
let me see . what do you want to do then ?
i am going to the hospital to see some friends .
what 's the matter ?
congratulations .
what 's the weather like in the world ?
yes i do . i find it very informative .
i am going to need your key sir .
i 'm going to try to read the newspaper .
why do n't you ask the manager to help them ?
we may go to tianjin sports field .
really ?
yes . the girl and i like her very much .
i 'd like to study in the uk too . my family is really expensive .
i do n't like it .
you can have a seat on the back of the <unk> . you can have a look at your hand .
wait . we have to return to our homeroom and wait to be dismissed .
yes i 'm on a business trip . i 'd like to but i do n't get much either .
ok .
i know . but playing chess is very popular .
there 's no doubt the internet will be a powerful commercial medium . it 'll connect hundreds of millions of customers and open up huge markets for all kinds of products and services .
read me out . all the time is finished .
no . i 'm just a black sheep .
really ? congratulations !
congratulations ! that s great !
it was excellent . it was actually the most popular one in the world .
no i do n't feel like it .
do n't worry about it . you do n't have to take sleeping pills every day .
i could n't afford to be late because i was late . i had to wait for the next day .
but it is n't worth it . you can just drive slowly and carefully .
two years .
sorry that 's too late . i usually go to bed around 1000 pm .
i 'm a student . i 'll have to take a pay rise .
it sounds too short . it 's nothing serious .
i appreciate you telling me .
i beg your pardon ?
would you be able to pick him out of a lineup ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
and i love the winter air after tomorrow .
it 's fantastic !
i know . i will be there before 17 .
well this is nice just stay at home . if they 're going to be okay i 'll go with these two .
that 's right . i want to buy some flowers and try them on .
you said it . ok let 's go dutch .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . .
no thanks . i 'll see you then .
sorry sir .
you were in china right ?
i think i 've lost some weight .
that 's a good idea to make a withdrawal .
it 's just a moment . i 'll go out with this <unk> .
well we really have some new interests .
it 's my girlfriend . she 's my boss .
fantastic ! i 'll let you know when we get off .
maybe .
cool ! they 're going to be so happy .
what do you need to know ?
ok . let 's just sit in the back .
sure . why are you going to wear it ?
which child would you recommend ?
i 'm doing well .
no . why ?
how about a coffee in that cafe ?
no way !
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
how long will it take ?
it 's so cool . it looks like it 's going to rain .
he 's got a promotion .
calm down ! she is really pretty .
well you should have kept eating less money .
sure your car is on my way .
i guess i could .
oh that s a lot of money . how about a lizard ?
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
i had meetings back to back all morning . and phone rang off the hook from the minute i walked into the office .
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
maybe next time
that 's ok . i guess you will be more helpful in the future !
several years ago .
that 's a lot of money !
yes i m . my name s mark benson . i just started a couple of weeks ago .
you re such a geek !
this machine gives you all the plants .
i 'm glad that you felt so happy . i really appreciate it .
really ? congratulations ! what s your name ?
yes . she is a teacher .
really ? i m very surprised . he doesn t look like a guy who d ever do that sort of thing right ?
she is pretty . she looks so cute .
next june .
you re right . i guess you re right . i just wish i ll come and meet you at the top .
do n't be so sure . you are the right person for the <unk> .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well . we started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done .
what s the time ?
all the laundry will be ready by 5
that 's all i need to do now .
i m so happy for the family !
who s the matter ?
the palace hotel .
i m so happy for you !
we ll have to try it . don t you know where we can look at the other hotels ?
you re right .
as you know china has a singlechild policy . therefore there s just my husband my daughter and i . what about in your family ?
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
about seven years now . and you ?
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
ha ha i ll keep that in mind but don t tell my husband .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .
cindy s husband is ron .

they have two childrenone son and one daughteras well as one daughterinlaw and one soninlaw .

oh i don t think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world .

in the same way probably .

yes but the delay was running on us this month .
what do you mean ?
goodbye .
i knew that already .
have a nice day bye !
what do you do after that ?
i should finish it as soon as possible .
bye !
i 'm probably going to spend the day looking at cars .
not much . i 'm just trying to get a ticket .
oh really ? that 's nice .
why do n't you try it and see what happens ?
yeah it 's not that long of a trip .
what do you think the problem was ?
i would like to take the test .
we 'd like to be seated at 8p m .
oh well how many people has she given invites to so far ?
that 's great .
i must go to the library to see you off .
not much . i 'm just trying to hook up to the internet . i 'm having a few problems though .
i 'm a little tired . i 've been having trouble breathing lately .
oh really ? that 's nice .
because you can use your bus pass as many times as you want .
no i 'm not .
you have to do something romantic .
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
i think we should do something sometime .
it will be summer . so it will be hot .
well that 's okay . you can see the whole city sign here .
even if they break down they 're still works of art .
i like music that has a fast beat and is lively like dance music . you know i go to a disco almost every week . sometimes it 's too loud though . you prefer classical music don t you ?
i know . it 's a mix of all the latest songs .
i want to open a checking account .
for a double shot of hold on with a man who successfully completes over 120 units for his or her undergraduate major and elective .
i think it 's very exciting and the classical music is too complicated for me .
here is the survey report from the king 's . why do n't you try to get it fixed ?
let 's see . . . you 're capable of invoking and wants to use it .
actually i like classical music . do you ?
oh what kind of music do you like ?
it 's very exciting and the hero keeps me so good .
from your part of the reservation i was thinking of a table for two nights . would you please hold the line ? i do n't know the name of the table .
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
here 's the survey report from the king 's . by the way where did you get that comes from ?
i have no idea .
i like classical music .
what kind of music do you like ?
a chinese restaurant . i 'm sorry .
that 's english . what were you doing in your classes ?
i like popular music best .
here 's the survey report from a wellknown public surveyor in london . you may inspect the defective instruments personally
i know . i ca n't believe in either .
it 's gone with the wind .
what kind of movie do you like ?
i feel they 're dirty .
but we could have to finish it later .
yeah . i heard they were supposed to get into a lot of fun .
no i 've only got a few pounds .
i 'm really interested . tell me about watching tv .
no i did n't . i was sick .
it 's almost as if we got busy this year .
so maybe we should n't go out after all .
i am sorry . do you have a particular one ?
italian .
what 's this ?
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
what ? oh no there 's nothing to do . they had no idea a tornado was leaving the weekend .
what time is it ?
i thought this was the right stop .
really ? what happened ?
i ca n't believe you were watching movies .
i ca n't believe it .
have you found anything nice yet ?
sure . let 's go to a movie .
i like their music very much .
me too . i finally wanted to see the old film .
i was also interrupted by her last week because of such a thing .
they sure are .
yeah . i heard the movie was written by the end of the week .
i appreciate you telling me .
i can t wait to see what the interior looks like .
let 's see what happened .
that sounds like a good idea . you look really pale and red eyes .
what made you decide to leave ?
any time . you 'll have to watch it together .
mazda . honda and nissan .
were you able to paint the computer or paint ?
what do you think of ?
what do you exactly mean ?
two days .
you should be then .
i always passed the test .
i feel miserable .
and i did n't have any money with it ?
you 're welcome .
and why did you want to talk to him ?
yes i like collecting things .
you might also have a virus .
i am volunteering for the campaign .
are you sure ?
well i suggest you use the machine . he told me that i need to fix some things .
i thought you could attend a school in the future .
yeah i 've been learning chinese songs this way for years .
i feel miserable .
and i did n't know that old lady come back to me because i did n't want to hear what he was doing .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .

i did it .
then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door .

i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
we are very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience .
what 's the matter ?
which subway should i take to get to the east side ?
oh my god . what time will it be ?
i 'm afraid it will take 15 minutes at most .
ha well we have no choice .
oh is there ? which room is it ?
it . . . i think the neighbor on the right .
really ?
yes . what can i do for you ?
you should go to sleep now so you 're not tired .
if the nest room is still noisy could you give me a different room please ?
that 's too bad .
let me see the room . oh yes i do n't know where it is .
not too long or short . try not to grow up with the changing clothes .
alright . well i 'll have to get to the hospital in my car .
well no . i am afraid i have to leave a little early on the waist . but i 'm afraid it 's not the right time .
you can take the subway to get there .
i hate the bus system in london !
about 20 to 30 minutes .

you can take no . i bus or a taxi .
excuse me sir . where is the no . 1 bus stop ?
please turn right at the traffic lights .
and where did you go ?
i 'm pretty good . how about you ?
it may be true but i will do it for you .
as you know we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product lseries .
did you see the results you were reading ?
that s a great idea . let s go to the skating rink on saturday .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
doctor i have a bad cough and a headache .
do you have a fever ?
i do n't know but i feel terrible .

ok . do you think i can play football tomorrow ?
of course not . you need a good rest .
ok i 'll listen to you .
i do n't know where to go for college and what to major in .
how long have you been like this ?
yes i took this medicine just before i do n't know what to do .
do you own any other questions ?
yes . i 've got a lot of information . would you like a drink ?
i 'll be back as soon as i get home .
yes i 'll try to keep it .
i know it 's not as i had planned .
thank you .
you 'll have to have some laboratory examinations to know for sure .
i believe i 'm going to have to go to see the doctor .
goodbye .
it 's your blood pressure i 'm afraid . it 's far too high .
and what 's the cause of that ?
the mayor and high official practice crony is mand a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions .

when do you start the payment then ?
i have got them all .
you need to take care of this video .
yes .
very good . but mr . smith is one thing i can do for you .
what 's the meeting for ?
can i pay any attention to my work ?
you are welcome . have a nice day .
yes i did . it was one of the conditions of the insurance policy .
how did you eat that ?
i began to went there last month .
our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . can you serve them in english ?
the export business section .
actually i ve been completely out of shop for cash . what 's the matter ?
oh . this is a good idea . i 'm glad you like it .
i bet you also invest in it for money . you see our passport is a <unk> business trip to the united states .
yes i find the price of those countries that are whenever popular .
well the new house needs to be in the paper drawer . let 's see if it 's available .
i advise that we go online shopping . the art of is to <unk> the art gallery . it s a program on greek and roman sculpture .

it 's business news !
yes we do . we have located in a <unk> country where we wanted to do that is just opera fans .
oh i see . by the way there must be too many things to be done .
there 's always a piece of news in my opinion . i do n't think it 's appropriate for me to do it .
yes i agree with you . chinese is one of the most important things i can do .
you 're welcome .
i am an excellent communicator . people trust me and come to me for advice . one afternoon my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . i made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .
do you think you need to go to a good diet ?
i tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . however i began setting timelimits for myself .
what are you going to do ?
it was 3 years ago and we have been employed as a project manager .
exactly ! i was planning to apply for the visa of china in the future .
yes i work well under pressure and find it dimly . however i believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines .
have you ever had any trauma ?
i think the key point is that i have strong working under pressure . i could n't stand it when i had the flu . i think that it 'd be better if i fail .
sounds reasonable . everyone in your last position do you think you can tell me about the benefits of the job ?
i stick to my principles and keep to the rules . sometimes they just lack enthusiasm . when i get them involved with something constructive some of them change their attitude later .
i like photography very much . i used to be awarded second prize in a photography contest at our university .

no .
well you 're right i 'd better take a taxi .
what do i need to work in the company ?
that 's true . if you lose your job you can save money while you 're shopping .
thank you very much . i 'm looking forward to it .
fully agree . i do enjoy the convenience though i am still a beginner in using excel . the latest office equipment is more typefunctional . it combines fax machine copy machine and printer in one . it saves a lot of place one machine instead of three .
yes this machine is even smaller than those before .
when will we get one of those ?
you know our boss always trying to save the last penny . we have to use up the equipment first .
of course .
sure . what 's your next name please ?

about seven years now . and you ?
how many people are there in your family ?
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
who are the members of your family ?
my husband my motherinlaw my daughter and i .
working for your company ! as the top administrative assistant in your firm !
good answer miss zhanggood answer ! seriously though are you interested in staying in a stafflevel position or would you hope to move into management someday ?
well i have n't thought much about this . i think it 's too early to tell . what is the most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . if the company is happy with my work then i think i would like to consider other positions in the company .
i hope to major in english literature but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year so we ll see .
what kind of information are you interested in ?
i am in beijing .
what kind of school did you get ?
yes i have been there in the past two years .
what courses have you completed ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
do you feel that you have received a good general training ?
yes i have studied in an english training program and a computer training program since i graduated from university . i am currently studying finance at a training school .
what kind of work were you responsible for in the past employment ?
yes i passed college english test band 6 with good skill in listening speaking reading and writing . i have n't got any certificate of computer skills because i don t think certificates are necessary if what s needed is merely operating a computer . i think practically to know how to use a computer is more important . and i am quite familiar with microsoft office .
yeah i 've been working so much overtime lately .
really ? how come ?
my boss gave me a big project . i had to have it finished by this morning . it was so difficult .
you should n't work so hard .
i know but i work hard all the time for long hours .
what do you mean ?
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
i am studying languages .
what is your major ?
because i was quite interested in economics then .
why are you choosing to work our company ?
the most important thing i must continuously improve my abilities .
what was the most important course ?
i like no . 4 .
yes that would be a good suggestion .
i 'd like to say i was an english major .
i am studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .
so you 're leaving in the city of pennsylvania <unk> ?
i feel well now .
what do the next step into my working place ?
i will do my best .
it 's too bad . we have a big tree this morning .
nice to meet you ! my name is peter smith .
this is a first day ms . smith .
nice to meet you too !
well hope you will enjoy your first day !
ok i will . what can i do for you ? i hope you have a good time .
you 're welcome . we wish you a speedy recovery . goodbye .
can you give me some points at the meeting ?
absolutely .
that 's right . we have no choice .
i want my change .
will all right . and salary is the most important thing for you .
that depends on how much you make .
we are happy to hear that . what is your credit record ?
we will . it 's a fun show .
well i was just joking and obama is our new president .
i 'll take it up with my girlfriend .
say why do n't you come with us ? we have plenty of room .
no problem .
any other week are from 9 to 5 pm .
that 's not all i need to do ?
they are doing fine thanks .
oh i see . that s very different from the chinese education system . i did n't know why our english is so different .
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
yes i can . i speak it very well .
what do you think of your present job ?
i have been attending an evening course in english writing for 2 years and i often read novels magazines and newspapers in english .
that 's right . i 'll have to think about it .
why do you plan to change your job ?
yes i do . who are your financial backers ? who are the key competitors ? does the company have a plan for the ipo ? what would you say is the best thing about your product or service ?
certainly . let me get a promotion at 5 ?
i believe they will .
it s my honor to know that one thousand dollars has been limited .
are n't any more uh .
yes i 'm really excited .
how much do you need ?
absolutely not ! well they do give you another bonus .
yes i do . who are your financial backers ? who are the key competitors ? does the company have a plan for the ipo ? what would you say is the best thing about your product or service ?
what do you mean by that ?
yeah so many people in this field are from one of the short distance .
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i 'm studying in the foreign languages department .
i guess you are right .
i learned to be patient professional and gained some experience of direct sales .
yes i do . but i know that i am very oldfashioned now .
i see do you speak any other languages ?
i studied french at school but i ve forgotten most of the time i speak and german .
sure .
it is interesting is n't it ?
i see .
that 's fine but i prefer to keep a car .
where will the company be from ?
you have to take a bus tour . it 's really beautiful .
yes sir . i 'll bring your passport in four days . have you ever been to paris ?
yes it 's very different from the world too .
i 'd like to but i 'm not sure if i can .
it is interesting is n't it ?
it seems that we have only taken by this .
but thank you very much all the same .
i think that 's a good idea . there are many tourist attractions and many tourist programs for business .
i usually use this machine but it makes it a lot of practice .
i 've got to take that myself .
i have working knowledge of windows and dos . actually i 'm quite familiar with both java and c programming languages .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
do you know how to use a pc to process the management information ?
i found it a garage sale once .
in my opinion you should keep the interviewer in case .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
what can i do ? i 'm afraid i ca n't hear anything .
well i got the last 10 years ago and i have quite a few years ago .
when you make a specific impression of the interviewer in your dressing sense and age you will be prepared to show them the interviewer again .
make sure you show the best candidates and turn them on .
only if you make an appointment with a few days ago the manager should be aware of their work responsibilities .
gee how dangerous ! i 've almost knocked him down .
but i am not familiar with the medicine industry and i have passed all of them .
oh can i see a piece of pressure on me ?
what 's next ?
as a start of the job is between 1500 a year .
yeah that 's right .
yes i am applying for it .
ok .
yes i know what you mean .
ok please ask me when you have a seat .
i d like to work as soon as possible .
ok . let 's go .
would you please tell me how many days a week paid ?
no . but it is very busy working week .
i got it .
there 's no charge on baggage left .
i will take you three or four . they have three left .
you can use some time off . you ve been working too hard anyway .
six hundred and thirty .
sure . there 's no hot water left by next to the door .
then what else can i get ?
it includes your air fare your hotel accommodations and the meals .
that 's it ? i had no idea .
no thank you
how about my list ?
sure but what can i do for you ?
but i should have known before .
the major course is computer science and as you know my major is international trade .
i 've been fed up with study .
no you must n't let the chance and do your personal information .
that 's great ! do you think it 's important to make dinner ?
yes i am calling to apply for a job on the internet .
i am proud to know that you are here for some opportunity of our company .
you do n't know that this is not the only one who offers the excellent ones .
i think we 'll send you a letter next week if you are wanted or we may give you a call . by the way have you got a telephone ?
i think that the four months is a little higher .
sounds good .
i will try . thank you .
do you want to take a photo for us ?
just put your name on the top of your card .
i will be sure to wear a good tie will be better .
how do you know if we take it ?
i 'm sure so .
can i get that working under pressure ?
great . warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . good good . this week work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . now let s take a look at this tricky section .
the color and style are really good at cooking . is it a very expensive ?
yes i did like the chinese certificate of english training .
ok . it is so helpful to shorten the distance between you and the interviewer and create a lively atmosphere .
sure . what time would you like to meet ?
it 's nine o 'clock now . i 'll see him tomorrow afternoon .
i 'm sorry . that 's all i have to do .
thanks . i 'll call again .

it does n't matter . i just hope he 's better soon .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
shall we make it a reservation ?
what did you need it done ?
i will return this table .
630 p . m . but i 've got to go to bed before 6 o 'clock .
thanks i 'll go see you then .
speaking . what can i do for you ?
hello miao ping . i 'm calling to confirm my reservation .
well i am here to help .

yes can you like it ?
thank you .
it 's hard to say .
well i 'm afraid i ca n't make it .

i 'm in the hospital to see if i can .
when did you last time have your eyes checked ?
my grandmother swears by hot chicken soup for a cold .
good answer miss zhanggood answer ! seriously though are you interested in staying in a stafflevel position or would you hope to move into management someday ?
how about your typing and shorthand skills ?
it is urgent for us to fill this position now and i would like to stress that english is a must because of the international contacts and most likely traveling abroad very soon . if all these is not problem for you i recommend you to mention these in your cover letter and send it to me directly .
i had no idea when i was little we would have given by the end of this week .
shall we discuss this with our boss ?

thank you mr . smith . i do n't know how to handle this .
you 're welcome .
he is really cute . can i get you a hold of the line please ?

what kinds of benefits do you offer ?
certainly . if you sign the agreement will be received by 5 o 'clock so we will be able to return the goods after that .

do you like your current job ?
i began to went there last night .

i am glad you are a qualified person .
i really wanted to watch the star wars on the opening day but the presale tickets were sold out . how did you manage to get hold of them ?
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i 'd like to postpone that decision until later . maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position and how your commission structure works .
yes . it 's from my mother 's birthday .
i was thinking about ordering one hundred dollars a month .
that s right . if you re going to sign a contract we will charge you 200 as well .
it 's the most important thing to me .
yes you have a total of 21 days paid time off which is not as yet .
i hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . since my major was international banking i really hope to work at a bank .
then why do you want to work for our bank since it 's a new establishment in shanghai ?
because your bank is a new one i think i 'll be given more opportunities and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here .
it certainly is . but the work is also hard here . you need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field .
i expect to work hard madam .

ok . i 'll come for you at about eight .
do you like to use chopsticks
yes . sit down please . how did you learn about our company ?
i got to know your company through such famous brands as lux lipton and walls . after making a customer survey i was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of chinese .
why would you like to work with us ?
it 's an interesting job and your company is one of the best known . although i have no work experience as a salesperson the job description you sent was very interesting . it 's a job i 've been dreaming of when i was at university .
oh really ? would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected ?

because i got the promotion .
you seem to be a bit dehydrated . have you ever been involved in your english ?
i like doing aerobics in my spare time . it 's good for my health .
i 've set some goals for myself and my career and unfortunately i 'm at a standstill in my current situation . i have begun to explore options available before i spend too much time in a job where i ca n't advance . my goal is to continue to take on new responsibilities and be a key contributor to the success of an online venture .
i am all familiar with windows and dos . actually i am very familiar with both java and c programming languages .
i 'm going to move on to the car .
why do you think you re the right candidate for this position ?
yes i am .
where do you come from ?
not bad thanks .
that 's a long way to go it 's almost always so comfortable .
twentyone .
here 's your change . thank you .
yes in fact i was an english teacher .
what course did you take in the <unk> college ?
i am a student engineer who mainly took charge of understanding of the mechanical strength and corrosion resistance of various materials .
oh really ? why did you go to university ?
i have been working in the public relations section of a company in the past two years . i plan to change my job .
how many best job are you looking for ?
i like taking photos .
what kind of books are you interested in ?
i got professional training in this field and i believe i can fit the position well .
what 's your memory capacity of an email ?
how do you do ? my name is li ming here is my card .
pleased to meet you . my name is mrs . smith .
actually i think we 've come to some of our new products really have good reputation . we can not have the same feeling of our company .
thank you . yes i had a look like a nonsmoking room .
so what 's the quality of the suite ?
i see . thank you .
thank you for your information we can hold more talks later on business details .
then what do you think we should do ?
is that so ?
absolutely . take my word for it .
have you decided ?
yes i want to get a better job .
could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
oh that sounds terrible . would you be happier with higher pay here ? i m sure something can be worked out .
i 'm not sure . i think i 'll be able to manage it .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
yes let 's go into the factory .
what is this made of ?
how do you spend your time in sales ?
you can send a fax machine to the store or come up .
well we have six left . so what 's your room number ?
yeah just fill out this form and choose a password . the computer will do the rest .
let me check . we 'll need to check the details right now .
because you can use your bus pass as many times as you want .
yes i have . i think it 's our new president to do business .
sure no problem .
yes there are two brothers living here .
but we have no choice for the loss . this is our bottom line . you know we always trade your confirmation number .
you must have thought about the cost of our country . what 's your counteroffer ?
i suppose the payment needs to be made out of contract is for the end of the week .
we 've got about the same thing here in just one year . we 've got to get started and at the end of this month .
what do you need ?
i need to know if i have any fees to pay .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what do you mean ?
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
a secretary must be involved in this field .
i think the annual cause is just about what you would like .
the software of the computer is going on for next month and they should have lower level but if you think it 's not completely safe .
i have never seen an internet connection . i think the problem is that many people prefer being interviewed .
no really ?
yes flexible aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
it sounds like you really need to be more careful .
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
did you take any pictures ?
some people pay too much attention to the rules of this job .
it s good advice and easy to get along with . i m exhausted !
yeah sure it would be very good if you could show me something about your arm . oh yes we have a photo of the river .
well i get a business plan when i was in college . i won t let anything go on your own .
have you ever considered taking a topic before becoming a topic ?
wow ! this sounds interesting ! why do n't he just drive ?
i understand that . your proposal is not the same as i 'd say . but if you can be assured that we have no alternative conditions at a time or we may call you or take off with the other person .
let me see .
why do you think they are the only one who can be met ?
not really .
i see . by the way how many credits would be like ?
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .
what do you think his strengths are ?
well he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
i 'm easy to approach and friendly to everyone .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
i 'm quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
for me this would be having good relationships with my family members . my family has always been very close <unk> and we still spend a lot of time together .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
i graduated from peking university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes i was chosen as a three goods student many times in college .
do you have any publications ?
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy and it was published in china daily .
i can speak french and german .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
no i can only carry on a simple conversation in french .
can you read and write english well ?
i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed <unk> .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .
yes i 'm looking for bob .
i 'm mary kelly . may i ask your name ?
my name is b . how are you miss kelly ?
i 'm glad to meet you mr . zhuang . sit down please .
thank you miss kelly .

would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?
yes i would . after testing
what is this made of ?
yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let 's go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism and this seemed like a g
certainly . and after your internship ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes i see . but you must be in charge of your leave .
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes he 's a successful teacher .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m 27 and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around 16 .
ah i see so you were actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
very interesting news . how many years do you think we have ?
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
yes sir .
what interesting places shall we visit ?
all right who should i send them to ?
it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok home or office address ?
office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .
should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
yes it s right .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
well all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents information and other things .
what are they ?
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
and what is the most important point ?
you should always remember that one customer on file is the rule .

monica wait a moment . i think we d better call the repair man to do it .
i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light even during office hours i wouldn t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
other company rules also need your attention .
like this one ?
yeah thank you for telling me .
what s going to be covered in the orientation ?
the company introduction our mission vision various policies insurances pension plan company id batch telephone email setup and training .
quite a lot . all them one afternoon ?

good afternoon . my name is monica . i am here for the job interview at 2 pm .
ok please first fill in the form and return it to me . you can do it in the next door .

everybody attention . i would like to make sure you all know the process . the interview consists of three parts . one all of the interviewees will answer the questionnaire and it lasts for maximum one hour . two we will take a 30 minute s break . after the break we all come back to this office and i will announce the successful candidates

yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?
of course not i appreciate that .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
do you have a cold ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .
well i 'll cancel your appointments for today . and i 'll tell mr . morley .
thanks ann . talk to you this afternoon .
hope you feel better .

i see all right this week . let me have a look at another copy of the things . i can t believe that mr . parsons .
okay well let s get started ! get some paperwork anyway . i ll see you after work .
that s what i did for you last week . well i m still very surprised to hear your questions . what would you say again ?
come on don t be so dramatic ! help me put away from the ground .
well i have learned some skills about how to speak spanish and i can also carry on a business trip with my colleagues .
that 's fine . we have a lot of successful characters .
well i studied french at school but i ve forgotten most of it . i learnt some russian while i was studying there and now i study spanish in evening classes . do you speak japanese at home with your parents ?
i need to work in a small company where i can grow anymore . my work has more interesting .
great . what do you think is the most important thing for you to be an experienced employee ?
i have four years study in the department of mechanical engineering and it has given me a solid theory foundation . moreover i have worked at cab company for 4 years and got a lot of practical experience .
i am in nanjing university . i am a junior .
but i heard the north of china are experiencing severe sandstorms !

please call me ted .
well ted this is a very impressive resume . however we do have several other applicants to finish interviewing before we can make a final decision . we ll call you by friday if that s all right .
that s no problem .
do you have any other questions ?
yes i do . who are your financial backers ? who are the key competitors ? does the company have a plan for the ipo ? what would you say is the best thing about your product or service ?
salary is based on experience as well as time spent with our company .
i see .
but thank you very much all the same .

yes i have been there in the past two years .
what was your graduation thesis on ?
the average grade of all my courses is above 85 .
it 's pretty good . did you have a good choice ?

i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
so you must be tired after learning english .
yes . i was elected excellent party member for four academic years .

i ll do that . meanwhile could you give me an indication of price ?
here are our f . o . b . price lists . all the prices in the lists are subject to our confirmation .
your price is reasonable but i must point out your price is higher than we expected . maybe you can place a little lower than i expected .

i hope the goods will be made soon .
that s something we can discuss later .

what am i supposed to do ?
i thought you heard .
why do n't you join us ?
you re welcome .
what are you planning on doing now ?
i 'm going to quit my job .
you should try and make it early to your polling place .
yeah . i went out last night .

what do you do to deal with the stress ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .

what kind of person did you see ?
even if they break down they 're still works of art .
i have a terrible headache .
what kind of person are you giving ?
because our contract says that you will live here for three years .
i do n't understand why they are always saying that .
yes i was very busy after work .
how about going to ms . collins will be able to deliver them today ?
yes they did .
these are for internal use .
i did n't know . i was thinking of him from a while ago .
i see .
just come back when you have your id with you .
i have . what happened ?
he took the money and tried to get away .
no sir . i 've never seen a black sitcom .
and then you must be joking .
while i 'm busy ?
you did a horrible job on my hair .
do n't you know they have to pay the fine .
yes they 're coming to shanghai .
did you see anything ?
they caught a cold on the sidewalk .
let me tell you .
no what happened ?
it has nothing to worry about .
yeah now i know a .

i really did n't know that .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
ok . see you then .
i need to go to the police station .

i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
and junk food is good for health . it 's bad for your health .
not really !
this tv system is really cheap .
it was taken by a truck .
excuse me ?
i would like to make a plea .
what s your plea ?
i was told by the officer that i ran a red light . that information is n't true .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
what do you mean by saying so ?
what are you saying ?
yeah it 's not that long of a trip .
terrible . it must be the truth .
that 's the new word .
okay .
how about a barbecue ?
i 'd say yes ! i 'm almost finished .
oh i see . when do you want to be your lawyer ?
i also like to go to church .
what would you do if you leave them ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
that s a good idea . we should get most people quit and do some exercise .
he said that a government could provide training with a roommate .
oh that 's terrible . he must have been trying to come off work late tonight .
i guess i 'm a bit oldfashioned . i 'd better take a taxi to see the fact that i have been looking at .
no not at all .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
it happened this morning .
let me take your blood pressure . you look anemic .
i hate going to parties .
is it urgent ?
the officer says that i ran a red light but i did n't .
yeah it probably sounds like a good idea .
do you know what 's wrong with my pc ?
i 'll try to keep it .
oh yes i know .
well what do you think of the film ?
i was denied a visa ?
so his parents must be opening ?
no but i did n't get it . i 'm a hurry .
well you have to take the course .
they had no reason for arresting me .
do you have a lot of money ?
i do n't think so . the flowers in the middle of my country are going to be so fresh .
it is hard to take a little time .
of course not ! how can i put this ? france is a terrible team .
yes . i m proud of you .
i have no idea how to use the atm .
it 's too bad . i ll ask my sister to give them a hand .
perhaps you could consider eating less than other language . how about a topic for the nowadays ?
when do you solve the problem of damage ?
like for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
when do you take the passport ?
yes i have . i once worked as a trainee every summer at the university every year .
yeah i really wanted to go out with my friend .
yes i did .
i m sorry mr . emory s office building at the end of the week . i d like to book a lunch for tomorrow .
sure . it is said that the first date is supposed to be the most <unk> .
i got it . we should start with a big fight and then we don t have a good time .
in my opinion the olympics has been a great growth in how many years have you been the problem ?
can i have my bill ?
yes i can .
that 's excellent ! well those are a little different .
not just a thoughtful granddad but a generous one too .

no . . .
i need some medicine .
well we can help you with that .

oh dear ! yes mr can i have your passport ?
certainly . here it is .
i can only keep the money in my pocket ?
we would n't be willing to do that . what 's the number ?
you should 've been really hurting for cash to keep up or credit .
right .
very well . thank you for coming . i 'm sure mr . smith will be here a little bit .
well mr . smith was said his first choice of his or her father is coming to his office . he had an appointment with mr . liang tomorrow morning . but he was aware that they had a little trouble with this company .
so i 'll have to think about it . i can make a decision as long as i 'm looking for the job .
i 'm afraid not .
it depends on how much you want .
it sounds reasonable . let 's go into the room and see how this goes .
that 's the most important thing to me .
no thanks . i m just looking . can you tell me how to use my key card ?
you can say that again and we 're trying to buy the goods again .
great ! is there any minimum deposit for all of this ?
yes we do . it 's included in the lobby . you 're welcome to our lobby .
i see .
sure what do you need ?
yes i 'm looking for bob .
now if you 're staying at our hotel you can take care of the details .
only 15 nt per section . oh it 's <unk> of the united states . you will see our exports are supposed to be <unk> in foreign trade . the last part of the year was founded in 2000 .
how about this one ?
here you go . what 's this amount ?
well it 's time to make sure that you are on your back . you can have a good time .
by the way can you tell me what the rate is today ?
have a great trip .
everything is done . here 's your passbook .
yes . can i look at the five routes ?
how long ago did you do that ?
i 'm here on business . is it possible to get a loan ?
i know i am thinking about this .
how many days of paternity leave do you offer ?
please accept my proposal sir .
yes . i 'd be glad to tell you that .
i would like to withdraw 300 .
for how many bedrooms and bathrooms do you have ?
by the way what if i m not interested in changing positions ?
they are blue samsonite bag .
fine . i 'll be in later than simple enough .
could you tell me when it will be back on ?
ok !
this is your receipt which you have to keep until the remittee receives the express . you can also check your post on our web . the post number is on the top of the receipt .
here 's 20 yuan .
oh i 'm afraid not . we will allow you to take a full day off .
i would like to change my visa .
would you like to get a rain check ?
i want to deposit it .
the hardcover is more expensive .
ok . i ll be happy to hear that .
have a nice journey lily .
i do n't want to make any changes to my old card .
thank you . and what amounts do you want the checks in ?
ok . could you give me a little bit faster ?
you are welcome . see you next time .
i would like to talk to you about your daughter .
i 'll take it .
all right . shall we leave two tickets ?
no problem . is there any mail for these ?
right . here 's the advantage of the conditions for insurance policy .
well we want 1000 rib for our imports .
my mattress was supposed to be delivered today .
it 's said that the goods are sold out well . the goods are as good as the standard .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
yeah i see . thank you very much .
in some case of other cities where many people are equal to drink .
the goods are wellexamined before shipment . i 'm afraid the losses must have occurred on the earth .
ok i will do that .
ok i will try .
we like the best company .
i see . so this is the advantage of having all the long history .
maybe i should make sure they are all <unk> .
you mean on a business trip ?
all right .
oh i know . but i ca n't agree with you . you must compare our products with the manufacturers for an earlier delivery .
here 's the money .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
oh you need n't send an email in the mail too .
i ca n't think of anything . if i do think of something i 'll be sure to call again .
can you read the characters ?
you can pick up your luggage at the airport from our hotel .
i 've been looking forward to visiting your factory .
it 's ok . i feel quite refreshed and forth .
oh thank you very much .
you 're welcome .
it is our pleasure . one of the steps is to be looked at the . one is to see what we have .
as far as i ve been dreaming of business and i don t have any experiences . our company is a rule of the business but i must say i have to say goodbye to your quantity .
well i 've never done that in a very short time . we have just arrived for 3 days . is that all right ?
here it is . i think we need to work on the production line . let 's go into the finance department .
so that 's the point .
i 'm a journalist . i write for the general manager of the fareast industry corporation .
alright . we will send your catalogues to our store . meanwhile may i have your name please ?
i am afraid i ca n't agree with you there . our agents in other areas usually get a 3 to 6 commission .
in this case you should pay more attention to what you need to get .
ok . i think that 's a good idea . but i know their strengths are the same thing .
i 'm afraid i ca n't attend that time .
we 'll start at the payment center for the first half of the year .
i 'm afraid we ca n't handle any further on this price .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
oh a lot of money i guess . maybe i 'm getting back to my office and they 're spending a lot of time doing the same every year .
yes i know i know . you see we have done a lot of business in office and office work as well . they re quite reasonable now but i 'm sure you will be able to learn more from your new job .
but i have never thought about it .
i 'm sorry ma 'am . but i ca n't accept your offer .
certainly . i 'll try my best to get along with you .
i see . you 're most thoughtful of me .
what ! could you explain when it is possible to be paid in cash ?
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
thank you . i will make a call when i check your decision .
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
thanks .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
if that 's the case there 's nothing to be done about it .
i was n't told this place that i wanted to buy a big house and i had to look at it .
it 's ok .
i 'd like to say on the seventh side of october . it 's the best we can promise .
now everything is in order . mr . bradley your room number is 6020 . it is on the sixth floor and the daily rate is 90 dollars per night . here is your key card with all the information on your booking the hotel services and the hotel rules and regulations on it . please make sure that you have it with you all the time . you need to show it when you sign in for your meals and drinks in the bars .
i 'll see you tomorrow .
what time is your appointment ?
i 'm sorry but we ca n't do that .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
it depends on the price of course .
i 'm afraid that there will be no problem .
ok . i 'll pick you up at 600 .
all right . but i 'm only in on saturday .
well you can guarantee the quality at the end of the year and we will provide you with the benefits .
can you weigh them for me please ?
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
yes sir . we 'll pack it up .
sorry we ca n't . our price is too high .
oh yes . let 's make it . i think we should be able to make it at one fifteen . can you put me down for that time ?
well . we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l c payable against shipping documents .
i see . could you make an exception and accept d a or d p ?
no problem . we 'll give you a definite answer from the end of this month .
still there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . it would help me greatly if you would accept d a or d p . you can draw on me just as well .
well mrs . wang you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of <unk> it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er 's guarantee . we always require l c for our exports . and the other way round we pay by l c for our imports .
we can do that on the way .
are you having problems with it ?
thank you . here 's your card back and your money . please double check it for me .
ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest in small change please .
ok here you are .
ok . you have to fill out this form and let me see three identification cards or documents .

let me see them . yes we will pay out of your account and sign here .
okay .
you can deposit an initial amount of five dollars .
thank you .
how many are you interested in ?
a thousand dollars .
let me check with a credit manager . a record show your credit reading is quite high . i do n't think you have any problems .
yes i think so . it 's friday today . let 's go have a look .
it 's 1 australian dollars to cover the deposit on the basis of daily necessities .
certainly . if you 'll just give me the money and your id card please .
here your are . i wonder how much interest can i earn for my current account .
oh . you are welcome to pay more than your current account .
that 's good . i 'll take the money .
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
i see . how do i draw money from my news then .
yes . how much do you want ?
fifty dollars . what is the exchange rate today ?
one dollar to five <unk> . is that alright ?
yes . how much do you want ?
of course we 'd be happy to cash it for you .
i won t to be here tomorrow . what are you business hours ?
i 'm not sure . what about you ?
for how many guests please ?
you 're welcome .
yes you can . but you have to pay in full fare of course .
well i 'm only here for 3 days so i think 500 gap should be plenty .
certainly .
yes i 'm checking out .
please fill in the slip stating the exact amount you wish to withdraw .
all right . and here 's my bankbook . is that all ?
please sign here . you can see that sign here .
yes i want to change some notes .
it 's a bit expensive .
your room number is 210 . the bellboy will show you the way there . i hope you enjoy your stay .
i 'd like to have a look at your air conditioners . hum this one looks pretty good .
what denomination ?
i can get 300 pounds a week .
three thousand ! that 's almost too good to be true . did she say why her friend wants to sell it ?
right . here it is .
apparently you have unpaid late fees .
i 'll take two in six weeks .

good morning . i 'd like a business suit made with this material .
yes the bank is on this street .
i set up the personal wealth management service with you but i 'm going to be travelling overseas . i 'm not quite sure what i should do . i mean is it possible to still use the service ?
when ?
i do .
for members there is a small transaction charge but it s only 5 dollars per transaction . any particular denomination ?
of course ! let me see your id .
let me see . it 's six dollars .
all right . here 's 20 .
i 'm not sure . you can buy from that .
i think i want to change 4000 yuan .
does that include utilities ?
ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest in small change please .
for how many years ?
thank you . do you need the invoice ?
thanks and you too .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
i ve been busy with work . i m looking for a job .
please explain what you feel about our company .
i 'm in the middle of something .
i want to ask you to come back to china for a year right ?
i would like to know more about the conditions and the number you are applying for .
do i know how to get a card ?
i m thinking of taking some money out of the office .
see how much i owe you ?
did you have a good journey ?
i 'm proud of you for your price . i really do n't think you re helped make a big difference in the way .
that s ok .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
i know . one of the best clothes in taiwan has become the best price . they must have lots of money .
yes i had a bad dream .
is there any other types of market selling new market ?
what is the problem ?
why ms . ransom ? i hear your companies didn t find out how to pay for this job .
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yeah i accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
