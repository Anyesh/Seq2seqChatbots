they do n't have to sit down .
could i have the draft done that ?
you should get dressed up too .
that 's great . thanks for your help .
i know . i know . i know that i know . but i do n't want to get a new job .
i 'm going to clean my room now .
well i ve got to get a job that is really great . how do you feel about yourself ?
yes i 've been here for almost an hour .
i 'm afraid i have to go to the dentist .
that 's great . i think that 's a good idea .
i 'm afraid i have to go now .
it s really a shame .
well i guess you 're right . i just got back from the jobs you have in a couple of months .
i m sorry . i didn t think that would be a good idea .
i hope we can stay here for a walk .
that 's fine .
ok . i ll take a taxi .
i can t believe it !
what are you doing ?
i am so happy that you found me .
yeah . i m sure you ll like it .
i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to .

i 'd love to .
it s a piano match .
that 's a good idea .
that s a good idea . you can go to a bar there .
can i see the rainbow ?
have you ever seen a big iq in the field ?
yes i am .
yeah . i think that 's a good idea .
really ?
yes .
oh i know . i ve never bought it .

maybe i should just get a tongue .
yes i am . i will go to see you .
what does it say ?
i have to go to the dentist .
i hope you 'll have a good time .
it s a good idea . he likes it when he s in the office . he told me he had a proper time finding a new one .
i have n't seen them . they re all very informative and cultural so many people can see them .
i am going to the university of china .
i am sorry sir . you ca n't expect this up in the united states .
that s fine . thank you .
alright . i am going to go get a pair of running . i can t stand the car .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah i know . the problem is that the gutters outside are clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i think we are coming for the same car in the suburbs .
i 'm not sure .
i do n't know .
yeah it s a good idea . you can go to a game of singsong .
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also get a shot !
well you have to be sure about learning some things . first of all you should keep a good job .
it s amazing ! i ve never been to the same old page !
i know . i m really not in the mood for it .
you can just take the dog for a walk .
they re fine .
he s not very good at the long jump ! he s not a good shot !
he s not very good at the moment . he s a jump jump too . he s not a good shot .
that s a great idea . he has a jump nose . he must be very tall .
yes . they are not very good at the moment . they are not very good at remembering exactly when they are in the final .
are they swimming swimming ?
they re fine . they re very swimming pool and smoke .
but the ac has the <unk> and the white smoke is too strong for us .
the jump jump is about five meters .
why ?
i think that it s a good idea . the united nations could become a more active <unk> .
yes . i 'm just waiting for you .
yes he is . he is tall and slim .
he is responsible for the ability and he is trying to find a job that is available for the past two years .
what 's your problem ?

what does he look like ?
i don t think so . he s a good guy .
i think you 're right .

we are supposed to gambling on the game .
what do you mean ? what do you think is that ?
well in that case we should probably probably think it is because we are often poor .
maybe we could just go for the long jump !

what are you talking about ?
i m not going to put my foot on the spot !
