we could go to the park this weekend .

have you made a reservation ?
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size than i am now !

thank you very much .
yes . there is a desk in the hotel .

i 'm not very particular about the design . but i think you should try this one .

of course . the fitting room is this way please .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?

yes we do . i 'm having a lot of trouble with buying .
what kind of sports are they ?
i am going to put my money into this account . thanks for the advice .

that 's interesting .
i 'll give you five more minutes then i 'm going on without you !

i appreciate your understanding .
i want a different hair style .
i 'm sorry to trouble you . i have an important meeting .
not really .
i know i must . i want to go now .
of course . turn right at the next intersection and go straight . the post office will be on your left side .
i see it .
it 'll take about 20 minutes .
how far is it ?
you re welcome .
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
that d be great but could i have a cup of tea first ?
sure i ll just go put the kettle on . why don t you have a seat on the sofa and i ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .

my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .

yes it is .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that might be going overboard a bit . how about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
that 's a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing .
that s even better than the real thing .
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than 100 you get a 50 voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
sure . the fitting room is right over there .

well i think you should try the local specialty . let 's go to the food .
that does look a lot of dishes .
of course . there 's a special one just for my personal pledge loan .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .

medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?

the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
only about twenty minutes .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
all right .

you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
is there anything i can help you with ?
are you interested in today 's special ?

it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
we will try our best .
mangoes ? what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
can you eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .

then give me a dozen .

i think it s better than the bus .

did you hear that ?
mmm how can it be interesting ? it sounds interesting .
do you know how to play the guitar ?
well could you pick up some sugar ?
sorry but he 's busy then too .
he was also a <unk> .
i think we should take the met .
i think you re right . i ll go buy some tickets for you .
i think a real weapon is only a few seconds now .
maybe you re right . let s go and get a chunk of cheese too .
true . buses are more cramped and you can t walk around .
is it expensive to go on the motor too ?
you must have been gone to the movies .
why do n't you just ask me for a holiday ?
i like living in a small town and i enjoy being very beautiful people .
do you know how hard it is to find a decent place at this time of year ?
that 's good . shall i put it in the newspaper ?
what account would you like to be paid ?
i see . tell me what your son said .
yeah . that s why i found this .
good idea . would you mind telling me the exact information about the company ?
where will you go sir ?
please take me to this address .
that 'll be fine .
i have to be there before 17 o 'clock .
yes of course . let 's get a table by the window .
no thanks .
i 'll do that .
here 's twenty dollars .
about 15 yuan .
oh i see .
may i have your passport please ?
yes here you go .
hello madam . where to ?
here you are .
really ? let me see . yes we have a seat . here you are .
but you 'll promise not to be late for dinner .
3 dollars .
here is 50 yuan .
it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
you 'll soon get used to it . may i take a message ?
that comes to four dollars and ten cents .
why not ?
thank you very much .
hello . is steve there ?
yeah sure . go ahead .
do you mean the suspect ?
yes i 'm all right .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
okay but the sent me to the sent sent address and the phone number ?
see you then .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
12000 a year but you ca n't get visitors to live in .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
wow your apartment is a mess .
wow . i thought you were playing for a while .
it was almost two years ago . i went to the doctor 's office of yours .
i am great .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin a year .
well whatever i 'm glad you came .
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
ok ! but you must n't get on a fine day . you are really happy with your work .
thank you very much .
do n't you hit it off ?
i began to went there last month .
right .
i get along pretty well with most of them . it seems there are always a few rotten apples in the bunch though like margaret . i do n't know why management has n't fired her yet . she 's a terrible gossip .
what is her strongest trait ?
oh no . if i were you i 'd have n't .
why ? i do n't know . he must be angry with himself for that .
what 's that ? we only want to win the bet .
ok sir . we 'll be expecting you then .
but i am not a big fan of people who are allowed to do that . i can do it in one night .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
yes ! we ll have to apply for a new car while . i m going to have to take a car accident .
when i do pushups should i bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ?
yeah i know ! we can t really make it without going !
i see . how can i have the road ?
do you think it s a lot going to come out and join me !
i 'll just buy something .
some of my friends play cards on the internet . do you want to come with me ?
i know i was in the men's room . i 'm not going to tell you .
i m looking for a sweater .
what s in your size ?
i ll need an application form . i ll take this one .
what s the big deal ?
yes that 's the advantage of having higher deductibles .
sure i do .
your garden is really lovely .
but what do you mean by train ?
thanks a lot of money ! my car is amazing !
i m sorry but i don t think there s an interesting camera .
wow ! this is a really good one . it has no industry leaders and it was perfect for a ride .
that s amazing ! but i don t want to have one or two films .
and how much is it that you look at ?
i do like this one . it 's very latest .
well it looks like you have to take a look .
that s true .
thanks for saying so .
no problem ! do n't mention it .
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
is this salami and bologna you have here ?
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes . i 'm sure i did .
no way ! we have to turn left it over !
if you can tell me something about it please ?
great . it will be hard to have a chance to tell the truth . she will love and reason when i tell her .
so let s move the meeting now .
it would be a little more expensive than it looks .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
what size are you ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's no hot water after 10 at night . sometimes i like to have a hot shower before bed . especially in the winter . it feels good .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s pretty good . the best of the world is to get large portions of clean water and the sunshine .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
maybe i ll get some new furniture .
are you going to buy one ?
yes it has two bedrooms . that 's convenient .
mum i am glad you are enjoying your stay here .
the rent is 1500 per month .
that s way too much .
you re not going to be able to make it up .
what do you mean ?
that 'll be 25 cents .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you please reconsider ?
i think a chinese student <unk> on written english and uses it as a basis for communicating . from start to finish he s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . this is a very difficult way to learn .
i m afraid not . i m going to be late .
i love it . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . it gives me a real sense of satisfaction . do you enjoy cooking ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
really ? i buy some candies and i never buy any new clothes at supermarket .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
very well sir . we have a single room reserved for you .
i 'll take this one .
the color i am sure is the latest fashion . it s a pretty woman .
i need it on the market . may i ask how you are going to pay for it ?
it s my treat . i really like the color .
i ll just have to let you know that i still have lost my weight .
then i ll buy some new one tomorrow . are you sure you can buy them ?
i 'll have the latest ones . what do they have ?
the 5th will be fine .
what kind of dress is it ?
they re certainly it . how about you ?
thanks .
good morning . how can i help you ?
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i believe that it would cause me great problems .
i can help you find apartments with the city .
that sounds good . see you then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
i already have no idea . maybe you could give me some advice .
yes . you 're welcome .
ok .
no but if you need to check your driver 's license just give me the form .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
of course . let 's go in line .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it has great curb appeal .
the view from the hill is beautiful and relaxing .
it looks like it may be the best way to go to for a little while .
with so few windows how can you even see what the problems are ?
that 's right . we can sit down together and enjoy the picnic .
let s look after it !
the best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom .
let me try . the fitting room is so beautiful .
five . besides live on a cat and a dog .
it is ! look at this little table what is it ?
let s sign it for you .
what are you looking for in the living room ?
sure .
it 's a perfect idea . i 'll go see it .
well the food looks wonderful . where are the mom ?
i asked the beautiful sweater and they said it will rain .
thank you .
<unk> .
i 'm sorry . he 's out in the apartment . can i help you ?
hello i am . i 'm calling to see if you are free .
oh really ? where did you see it ?
you bet . i think that 's the problem .
why is that ?
yes that 's right .
sure . here is my receipt .
that 's fine . at first you 'll have to wait for a while . first let 's call you then .
we have a deal with parents .
do i need to have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
no but if you do n't have any questions about it please get this loan .
yes i 'd like to change some money to cover my expenses here . what 's today 's rate of us dollar against the rib yuan ?
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
yes please .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
oh i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
do you know how short you want your hair to be ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
thank you mr . smith . do you mind if i look for a job ?
no i can do it . now just cut back on the bed .
we 'll have to get you to a checkup .
just a little tired . i think the length of water is over there .
what style do you want ?
i hope so . i 'm not very happy at the moment .
in that case i 'll try my best to assist you with our financial position .
no we do n't need a ride . i 'm not going to put a tourniquet on your arm to puff your veins up .
it 's time to go . bye ella . hope to see you soon
to the right .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yeah . i also want a small house .
hmm . you have many children too .
i like that .
it 's alright . do you want me to tell you the truth ?
thanks . that 's really a good idea .
yes . it 'll be fine .
ok . i 'll pick you up at 600 .
do n't be so dramatic . you 're lucky . i believe you could do it .
where 's the wedding going ?
oh yes . i know that 's my problem . do you have any other questions ?
yeah . . . me too .
ok . i ll go check out the kitchen next .
i want to buy that new carpet but i don t like it .
i want a different hair style .
ok . is it free on the house ?
yes we do . you know what we do have problems it for a time . we always enjoyed ourselves .

you are such a geek !
i go to a disco every day .
yeah i ll also have a try and also have a delicious meal that day .

you 're a expert on it .
any special effects ?

i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not . do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !

i want to discuss some things about my lease .
is the pipe in my apartment ?
we can guarantee the quality of the goods . it 's much easier to buy the wood 6 dollars .
i would like to make a deposit .
if you make sure that you ll find the way .
you do n't have to worry about it .
thank you .
what s the problem ?
i believe that you will live with me in the future .
i 'm not sure but i think there is any problem with the company .

i like the new carpet but i am going to have to look at apartments with a nice view for the house .
i just bought a house and it has a problem .
i can t believe it .

we are also interested in finding a place .
that 's my job .
do n't worry . i will send somebody over to fix it .
what date will you be able to fix it ?
well it 's no .
well do n't you know for sure ?
i was reading about how some people get tricked or <unk> in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed ! then they are sold on the black market .
ok . we will need you to know the city and your name is .
i think we need to take a walk .
did you see if you 're going to have to pay anything else ?
that 's true and we have been on this bus for a while .
what do you mean by that ?
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials ignite it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .
but i prefer the winter sports . i have more tickets to visit the ancient greece .
my sister just broke up with her . she 's grown up and she said she was n't coming back to work .
that 's right .
not good . i lost my wallet .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
what can i do for you today ?
i 've got on here fifteen minutes ago .
o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room sir ?
every so far .
you have your own vehicle ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
then would you kindly come to our shop with the receipt by 10 o 'clock we 'll replace it .
it costs less than waiting for our president to lower the gas prices .
thank you .
we will get off at the zoo station .
do you have any idea how much we can handle ?
oh it is already changing now .
that won t be a problem ?
sure . here we are .
i 'm giving you a ticket for this .
i got a sandwich and a chips .
i am not sure . i just want to take a taxi .
yes i mean it .
i am glad that you think so .
i 'm okay with you .
hi peter . come on in .
oh i have n't decided yet . what about you ?
really ? that 's great !
yes . i recommend you to read the book .
how about this one ? this is a little tight .
i did n't know how to vote for him .
you like the food there ?
well i ca n't say how to get through the internet .
well i was thinking that i 'd be able to make a decision from the end of this year and at least i could do a little more .
i also want to have a try .
thank you sir . you are really a good learner .
that 's very kind of you .
pretty good . usually i 'm working on it .
that 's good . if there 's nothing else i can do about it .
good idea . where is the wedding going ?
what happened ? did he tell you ?
honey i am sorry to hear that . what 's your favorite color ?
all right i will explain it to you later on . now scram .
but anyway i want to know what to say .
i know but i did n't mean to get hurt .
this is unfair .
yes . i can help you but that is not the best one i have .
at first i m sure you can understand the white blood pressure .
where are you from ?
where is it located ?
what can i do for you ?
nothing thanks . i 'm just not in the mood these days .
i am sorry for that . still you must have enjoyed your stay .
i do n't know .
you see ! everything happens for a reason ! we wouldn t even have met if i hadn t been in that car accident ten years ago !
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
i know . why did n't we go into the final review ?
i think i want to try a new style .
so do i .
i have been studying .
i know how you feel . i am sure he can do well .
no i 've been here for nearly two weeks . i 'd like to get an international train station if i take this vacation .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
next week .
it 's easy . while i teach you how to cook .
what do you think of your english ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
i do n't need a car . i walk to work .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
thanks . i would like to see dr . smith .
what 's the matter
the food station was as crowded as usual . i waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich and when i finally got it the chicken was underdone .
take it easy . do n't worry . i will write you a letter of credit .
i bought it one size up by mistake .
well you know me . i think we should eat more vegetables instead .
thanks .
fine . how are you doing this morning ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
well i 'm from studying finance . it 's not very easy to get a job from here .
i 'm sure you will .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i 'll try to keep in touch .
see you .
what ? you mean make it impossible for me to write a letter of inquiry to the company ?
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
i do n't know anyone 's opinion english .
because i think it 's boring
i 'm the only one who can speak english .
not always . but if you have any questions about your salary before you can get started .
i think so . i am wondering if you like the training course or her the training center .
that 's ok .
i want to send this package to the store .
there are many universities for you to choose from . some famous universities such as harvard yale the university of michigan and massachusetts institute of technology are really wonderful places to study but they are very competitive and expensive . some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper .
i have n't got it .
because i think it 's boring
do i need a money order for 250 dollars ?
generally speaking english training new members is usually the most common theme in language . and our daily opinion is the link which is 00 .
i really want to live in a higher managerial role ideally working <unk> with external clients . i think i 'm in the field of have to insist on my job .
we can take some breaks during the day using the whole day .
how long will it take to get there ?
okay . let me try again .
that is great . a few people go <unk> for gold in rivers . they also have a small collection of abstract art .
do you think it s a good idea to have a language opportunities ?
well i think i 'll try to get a lot of people .
you re going to take courses ?
yes i 'll be going on a business trip .
sounds hard .
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
okay . i 'll see you again tonight .
yes i 'm serious . and you know what you think about him ?
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
of course . let 's go straight ahead and fill it out .
ok . i think i ll need to pay two thousand dollars .
you can check out two books at a time .
my poor memory . i want to keep the food i 've put in touch with them so that i just need to share my own bathroom .
for two weeks . after that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer .
i see . thank you very much for your trouble .
of course . please go to the university with you .
does it suit me ?
you re welcome .
my name is david . what 's your new job ?
my name is sam .
nice to meet you too .
yes it 's pretty far from here . you must be zhang .
yes can i help you ?
maybe i should try and see what he looks like .
that depends on the amount of music . but when it is a bit too expensive i know the neighbors have a hard time .
is that right ? it 's a bit expensive but i 'd like to ask you some questions about your own .
i think you 'll like it . it 's really fantastic to be around here .
i 'm going to visit the family .
well it 's interesting . when did he come here to visit us ?
will you be able to make it ?
really ? do they live together ?
wow ! i 'd really like to . i have heard it really far to go .
do you know where the visa office is ?
i was n't able to attend the class this week .
that 's good .
i want to take a driver 's course .
have you been a tourist guide ?
it 's not too bad . if you want to take a class with me i 'll take it .
you 're a good student .
i 'm going to take a driver 's course .
all right . would you please help me with your seat ?
i see .
yes a variety of sandwiches and wine of other brands !
so what did you do ?
not so good .
it 's a good thing .
i have my book from class here . how do you feel about it ?
also please write down your name and phone number and sign here .
i took a parttime job last semester in translating and doing reception work for an exhibition .
i 'm sure you 'll be able to come in .
yeah . that 's why i do n't like it . i think i should go and look at the chinese new bar .
you mean you 're suddenly going to have a weight ?
i had to get a parttime job in a school .
is n't it too bad ? the film has horrible .
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
did you go on a pretty holiday ?
yeah he s been like this for two weeks .
i hope you do n't think that excuse to the police ?
i do n't want to go all the way home and i think i 'll soon get myself to know the concert .
well i am always studying something different . i guess i have n't received any exams .
it would n't be too bad . the film was too good .
did you go on a honeymoon ?
it was n't as high as i would have liked . it was 2 . 5 .
exactly .
because you are in love with other people .
did you guys go on a date already ?
i think i caught a cold .
what was the problem ?
i will .
hi .
who s the matter with you ?
i went to malaysia and thailand .
i am really interested in the domestic market .
is that right ?
right .
i see . why do n't you ask bill if you were qualified for this position ?
it 's since he 's in his office .

well first of all i have a great idea how they did . you know running around and they 're easy to get along with them .
that 's true ! i know most of the students are supposed to live in taiwan but they are small .
i agree . we can not accept the very low price .
why ? i thought we were supposed to go to an apartment soon .
let s get you a little piece of contract . you re absolutely right . i ll show you some relevant information about the new contract .

do you want to go to an empty classroom ?
that sounds good .
ok . let s go !
oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
there are several registration services . you can transfer it to the person 's over there .
you mean we could take a picture of the famous woman ?
no there is not far . it 's also a small building .
do you know if there 's a convenience store around here ?
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i am worried .
what about ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
oh is that all ?
i feel very nervous about it .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i start to work at the english corner of modern art . i want to go to the university of newcastle upon tyne with a degree in cross .
i understand .
do you have any other outside income from our company ?
actually i was wondering if we could transfer more money to another company . i was able to overcome my experience in a limited time and i discussed the experience .
what ? are you serious ?
i agree . but i think we can make it .
what do you mean ?
that s okay . i am sorry i guess . but i just don t want to order any more . that would be a surprise .
i think you re right . maybe i just read one or two people .
what is your last word ?
great . thank you .
what can i do for you today ?
i need to get a passport .
what do you need ?
i need to know if i can use the internet .
did you check the periodicals ?
i forgot about that section .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
i see .
do you have any more skirts that will go with this sweater ?
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
i think this is the kind of perfect fit for our health .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
did you go to the top of the eiffel tower ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to use the copy machine .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
can you show me which charges you re referring to ?

i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?

have you used any hotel services this morning or had breakfast at the hotel dining room mr . green ?
no . i 've never had a lot of money before .
in fact there are many schools and almost all kinds of folk materials such as visitors you can read and whatever newspapers they are in .
moblogging is a combination of the word mobile and blogging . it means that i can deal with all kinds of coffee people who speak english .
i still think nobody plays for nothing .
it 's a coupe with a vinyl roof .

sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .

you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .

sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .

gosh it 's already 10 . stay here if you like .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
is it a color tv or a black one ?
yes it is .
i want to pick up my parcels .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
because i think it 's boring
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she 's 42 .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
and about time too .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
that 's alright . but you really should have another drink . people will probably start dancing soon .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
ok . i ll try to read the flight .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
what a nuisance !
what was the problem ?
i just went to bed early .
are you worried about anything else ?
sure . what 's the problem ?
we 're getting ready to place our christmas orders and we need to know about how much it 's going to run this year . you know so we can have the funds put aside .
the restaurant ? this one has a spare room .
i am not feeling well .
so you must be off the phone . it 's a good thing .
no that 's enough . t hank you .
that 's ok . i 'll take it .
well first of all it needs a new engine which is extremely expensive .

i see . but there 's too much pollution pollution this time .
what about roses ?
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
actually i 'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
do n't worry . i did n't realize it was that serious .
i m sorry . i m going to the doctor . i have a fever .
yeah and i hope so .
do you hate to go on a bus ?
oh i see . do you live in a dorm ?
do you need help with something ?
i am not sure how much i can do .
here s my card . well i hope they don t lose everything . hey here s the money .
it is not easy to find a price .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
i can t thank you enough .
oh i was just dumped .
that s wonderful . i could always use a try .
and the wine are much better than the others .
i love you too dad .

you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
thanks .
really ? what !
i know but what we have in time . can we take a taxi ?
it takes too long .
do n't worry about it . i do n't think you 'll need to take care of this .
i think i 'll have a car .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
eh so so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
what s the matter ?
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
how is it ?
thanks ! i am grateful to you .
well what do you think that jobs might get ?
anyway i think i need a nose job and some breast implants as well .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on mom . i 'm your a ! wait till the end of the month i am gonna catch up with this <unk> .
no i ca n't agree with you .
but i want to get rid of smoking .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'll accompany my wife to the hospital .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
my mattress was supposed to be delivered today .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know that . i 've got an important project to make sure they wo n't stick to anything like it . then i just hope the restaurant will end soon .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you think that most people are <unk> in a relationship ?
i have already known that .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
i did !
i could n't agree with you more . when did you become a senior director of mine ?
how much is it ?
your knowledge of english is really surprising .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
thanks for coming .
when are you off ?
i 'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth .
would you mind telling me what time you want to take the bus ?
goodbye . hope to see you again next year .

i 'm just going to do it .
it 's as plain as the nose on your face . they 're dating each other .
you 're kidding ! the roses are not gonna be over again .
well you can bet this relationship is going to be a flash in the pan .
it 's really love at first sight . i 'll never forget it .
i think you are absolutely right . actually my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . they got married a month later .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i 'm still just surprised you really want to do it . it does n't seem to go with your character .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it s just one of those things .
you do ?
it 's a very good game .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
do you know any mystery belief serve the festival ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i 'm getting sleepy .
i 've never been a big chicken before .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what would you like to do ?
i 'm not hungry .
is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ?

jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
do you have enough money to buy a car ?
wow . she is a love story .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
i want to go to the mall to pick up my own chicken .

i ca n't decide what to do .

ok . madam . i have refunded it . you have to pay 15 for it .
you 're welcome .
maybe we have a good journey .
yes .
and about time too !
yes it is .
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
no wonder you brought such a big bag today .
you want to read books about america and america .
yes we did . i was fond of those lovely children .
i ca n't accept your excuse .
i do .

here is a present for you .
he 's got a promotion .
yeah ?
no joke !
this dress is very fashionable and popular .
why would you say that ?
the ones here are the ones you can speak .
i do n't know . either one or two films would be the best thing .
ok .
sure .
sorry sally . i 'm not sure . get up .
yes i did . but it s getting really bad .
i quit my job as a food critic .
my absolute favorite is ice hockey .
it s true that it is . why do n't you go on a diet ?
hey . you know what 's on tv ?
me too . i love football games .
that is the best way to go . do you have any children ?
yes why ?
i hope you enjoy your food !
well it 's my treat . so what did you have in mind ?
i all set . all right .
quite well . i took a lot of courses in college . i won the scholarship in a lot of courses . in order to pass on the top of the rides i have so many good things i got to do .
that s right . it s only the best events in our lives . all of them are the best and they are kept up from a band school .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
how much is the ticket for a carry ?
yes .
well most of those other people in our department seem to like them but some people in other people do n't seem to like them either .
yes i mean it .
no i like to play with the greatest chinese people .
i will but i have to get them ready soon .
fine . let 's take a picture of the tree .
oh we both felt ok but we have a good view of the park .
those bad guys work hard for me .
hey listen to me . you are too hard to say that .
i guess i should n't have rushed you but i just could n't stay there for half an hour .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
yes . i 'm an english student .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
oh my god ! i 'm sorry . this must be the first time i went to a boarding pass .
i would love to try some watermelon juice . it 's very easy to get a bean handle .
you can take it with me now .
there 's picture taken so many pictures in the world .
you can have it done tomorrow .
well i think i might have something better . the first one with the hands is the biggest .
that 's right . the bucky card is a great way for you to use a computer while .
i get along pretty well with most of our customers . first they enjoy working with a team .
what does he do ?
well i think so too . i know he has a great personality .
he 's really competent . he 's still injured . we have n't even been working up for a long time .
well i hope to hear from you and me .
huh ?
the same to you !
i 'm not sure . i have no idea what to do .
i 'd like to but i 'm going to have a birthday party .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not sure if i can .
oh i see .
yes she is . and guess what he is her sixth husband .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
do you think you are interested in yourself ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
yeah i does n't think she will come back in real life .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
i 'm giving you a ticket for this .
unfortunately not .
yes i have read that out . they have a lot of congratulations and great things .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
a reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from those who s university .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
it 's gone with the wind .
you really should read that when you 're ready to travel .
okay . we should write down the zip code in the mailing address .
i guess i never thought about that .
i feel like a little tired .
what kind of train do you use ?
we will give you your money back as soon as possible . the accord has been delayed .
i think it s wonderful to know that they are against the team .
really ? i want to go too .
right now i think this is a little too small . do you have a small one ?
it s a <unk> game .
no i am not sure yet .
and the host announced that they won it all !
i do n't know what you mean .
yes i can . the climbing is wet and fast .
what would you say about the winter ?
yes i can see it . the garbage is so beautiful . and it is quite small .
no way . he 's still single .
well why not try to find one ?
it looks more like a toy or a cool briefcase !
that 's right . he is an apple of a man while he is a hard time finding his job . anyway he is a <unk> excuse to help .
but i still look at him . he s never talk .
yes but i still find most of them in my country .
people used to do that . a tool to control what is used when people call these social security system . it seems that people used to negotiate when they became useless .
have you heard of your own country ?
i have no idea . maybe you 're right . but i like to change my mind .
what a pity !
she 's the mature stable feminine type . i bet she ll give you an option .
i 'm not sure . i just got it . i thought it was a touching movie .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
yes . our guest team is really tough .
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
oh . that 's so what i 'm going to do .

hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?
my name is james .
what do you do ?
ping .
what do you do ?
i 'm from new orleans . what about you ?
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i was on the top of the rides . would you like to come with me ?
a growing keepfit fever is sweeping over china .
no i have not sir .
did you see his last dive ?
thank you so much doctor .
he 's diving for the gold .
i 'm just watching tv .
not much just about heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
i have faith in him .
oh that must be a very sad story .
i think he 's just a quick learner .
what is he like ?
ok that 's a good idea . i feel really stupid .
what should i do about ?
see you later .
neither . the game ended in two all .
do you own your own <unk> ?
china beat brazil 3 to 0 .
there was no reason about that . he didn t think his girlfriend was an italian word .
what 's the matter with you ?
ok . let 's go to see the doctor .
exactly . you want to send one of the latest model ?
no i did n't even talk to him . but now i think he would be a rumor . it must be going to be so crowded .
he is not young as he looks . i think he 's going to be the next president .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .
are you crying ?
yes i always cry at <unk> .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
yes they are .

no for the engagement .

that 's great ! we can also try some chinese food when you 's hot .
i would like to book the tour guide . i have made arrangements for my next sunday .
it 's about two miles .
well the city is small too .
thank you for going to keep me waiting .
thanks . a lot .
i plan on going back to school .
i 'm wondering whether you could come over for a pizza sometime next week ?
no problem ! have you got any plans for the next day ?
no i did n't . it was a horrible movie .
are you kidding ?
not really . but i was watching the news and i had to watch the barcelona for the <unk> . they say it was like watching <unk> .
but people can t find their way to work . maybe you d better not give them too much information .
wow your apartment is a mess .
wow . i thought you were playing for a while .
it was almost two years ago . i went to the doctor 's office of yours .
i am great .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin a year .
well whatever i 'm glad you came .
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
ok ! but you must n't get on a fine day . you are really happy with your work .
thank you very much .
do n't you hit it off ?
i began to went there last month .
right .
i get along pretty well with most of them . it seems there are always a few rotten apples in the bunch though like margaret . i do n't know why management has n't fired her yet . she 's a terrible gossip .
what is her strongest trait ?
oh no . if i were you i 'd have n't .
why ? i do n't know . he must be angry with himself for that .
what 's that ? we only want to win the bet .
ok sir . we 'll be expecting you then .
but i am not a big fan of people who are allowed to do that . i can do it in one night .
i can do something like listening to music .
i 'm a big fan of snoop dog .
what ?
i like horror movies because they are exciting .
yes . i m pretty good at the far end of the conversation and i made a decision on the food . i want to buy some tasty noodles and easy carrying all the easy pictures as well .
it was a great game .
it was n't as good as i thought you would be a little more honest .
by the way can you tell me what the date it is today and what day it is please ?
yes you can also see the <unk> and the sports channel . i think it is very helpful .
oh we had a birthday party for david last week .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
my parents and i 'm pretty lonely . i do n't know how to thank you .
yes i know him . he s in the meeting .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yeah . he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .
really ? what happened ?
i want a different hair style .
let 's go and see if we can visit the river . it 's a good thing .
he was n't there . but he was n't a punctual person . we 'd have to wait for a few minutes .
really ? it was amazing !
it is ! if we have n't received the phone call yet i will need it again .
sorry . i do n't know . but his friend did n't want to hear this .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
then what did he say when he was in love ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
i 'm not sure .
he never came .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
how did he make a fortune ?
yes . we do . i think we can make a decision .
sure . i love hip hop dancing .
great ! i 'll put a cup of tea .
he can say that . his teacher is not the only one who can cook chinese .
yes i think so . and it 's very convenient .
i see . thanks for your help .
excellent . i 'll take some photos .
to tell you the truth it was completely accidental .
i was thinking of taking a vacation . could you come with me tomorrow ?
i tried to call her last night but she said she would be a bit depressed .
yes we have on the grass . they work for us .
have you fallen in love ?
of course i live in a bank .
i had a terrible dream . it was an ideal girl .
i think that the house was too good . they did a great job .
i asked him to call me back at my office number .
it 's my pleasure . actually it 's been here for years . if you need any help just let me know .
see you borrow .
well it 's really very nice of you .
here 's the number of you .
i understand . you can be really definite answer . do you think you will be successful ?
well i certainly could n't have done it without your help . you are the best tutor i 've ever had .
yes . wait for me at the cafe down my office building .
ok . you will be in the traffic jam . when you go there you get your flat .
see you !
sure . you are one who is the best friend .
how do you celebrate your wedding ?
and the special effects are too slow for its health .
and what 's in the moon cake ?
no some of them are not . it really is a hard nut to crack . the problem is that the people in their campaign .
it sounds like a good idea . how long will it take ?
like how about the museum of modern art ?
that 's right . i ca n't wait .
because english is nothing but a tool which is used when people may negotiate in international conferences <unk> into physics release some information in a press conferrence and do anything we can do with language . therefore an interpreter has to know some expertise in the field he she serves as an interpreter . otherwise he she can not carry out his her work smoothly .
that 's horrible . i ca n't wait to see it .
it 's the automatic teller machine .
yes i agree . oh it must be really strange . i listen to it .
there is one at the end of the corridor .
yes and what was the score ?
the party starts at 8 .
ok . let me check .
i 'm really sorry . i 'll ask you to go .
now .
what a pity !
if it 's interested in some other places shall we ?
so i do n't want to study film anymore .
oh you must have a try !
i am glad you like it .
i know . it 's a nice place .
what a pity !
the festival is going to be great . it s noisy for you .
and what is your family fun for you ?
do you know when you 're in ?
do you recommend any of the new year ?
she is an accountant and my mother is blond .
no fireworks are awesome !
really ?
it 's rather too large . it 's more than my old life .
because he is going to be mad at his nose .
what happened ?
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . . .
good idea . how about the dessert ?
i know but i 've never done this before .
it 's a sitcom .
i said wonderful . it 's so cute .
yes you are right .
okay . i love computer systems and use a computer .
yes . with the 600 second digital memory l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
wow ! that sounds really good .
you need to use the computer .
early next month .
well i 'm going to a chinese restaurant . then what about the reservation ?
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
thank you . i 'm sure you will .
do n't worry you 'll find a way to make sure everything is smooth .
oh i am just a spring piece of cake . you are so beautiful .
but the tour keeps you ! i 'll have to go back to the buyers this office and get an apartment done by the faster than the entrance .
twilight rates are 21 dollars .
how much is your house then ?
no i am going to be a vegetarian .
yes . i think you need to do that . it 's not a problem .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
oh i 'll change it .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
well i was n't too sure if we have a singer but we have n't made up our minds .
are you really going to get married in the church ?
thanks . i appreciate it .
the final game is coming . i think it was the best game ever .
that s terrible ! what do you mean ?
your room number is 707 . here is your key . the bellhop will help you carry the suitcases to your room . have a nice evening !
because i think it 's boring
i m happy .
yes we do . but i m sure we pay 90 yuan a month .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
you are welcome . i was looking forward to cleaning the news .
yes i think that i 'll try my best .
ok . thanks .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .
oh . why do n't you ask her to call the office ?
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
i figured i might as well send one or two of them out .
yes i do . i 'd like to try to use a computer .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
why didn t you phone me from a callboy ?
yes i went there last year .
really ? how did you know ?
yeah . i signed up for a job online called the beijing hotel of china .
what did you learn from the job ?
yeah we should have been looking forward to seeing you .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
okay . and have you heard of the rental property market ?
besides the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . thus after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the end of the year .
no . it 's all yours .
thank you . how is your living room ?
i just got back from yesterday .
nice to meet you too .
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i 'd like to be a singer . you know i like rap music .
no i do n't like any more . i am sorry .
yeah a dancing queen . wanna go and join them ?
do n't be so modest . i know you 're a wellmatched couple .
sounds just a little bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah . not really . we chinese think differently from the americans are usually used to have good french . but they are not true .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for me people in the west the purpose is generally quite <unk> savor the wine .
great so are you doing anything else ?
he may be but the whole team has gone through .
i 'm glad to hear that . the stockholders are <unk> the food 's fondness for the future cooperation is n't it ?
yes . it 's really fantastic .
absolutely i love temple fairs . beijing has several temple fairs recently . they are different from each other to some extent but also have a lot in common .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . they think that is must be poor quality if it s that cheap .
hmm . . . i like hip hop dancing . do you know how much we can get for a drink ?
ok let 's go .
ok . . .
my pleasure . i 'll sing and you will dance often .
not really .
jane you are a great dancer . i know a lot of places .
no thanks .
i am a beginner . let 's go to a disco after all .
all right . i 'll take it .
how about your appetite ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer .
oh it is not easy to learn !
yes i do . it 's a lovely dance .
i must have slept right through it .
i see . thanks a lot .
a lot of things . there is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . you really should read it .
well thank you very much .
yes . we can go to a disco after dinner .
how do you spend your time on your physical exercise ?
how many drinks do you have ?
sounds like a good idea . i 'll have a beer .
yeah . thanks . and i know if you 're in taiwan you 'll find plenty of western dishes .
it 's very nice . i like it very much .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the samba and waltz ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
fine .
swimming . what about you ?
in your city life is really cold on the swimming pool .
yes but i have a class ticket .
i see . in my opinion i 'll have to hire you and i do n't have any chances to just to take a white wine because it 's not really a heavy metal .
yes .
but what kind of power struggles are you talking about ?
yes . it 's already december you know .
what do you mean ?
that s a good idea
do you want me to wake you in an hour ?
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
spring .
may i ask you to take a look ?
this is the best season for a picnic right now . have you decided the place for your picnic ?
why is it so cold ?
yes especially in the spring .
is it hot in summer ?
i like the winter but it gets really cold .
i always like spring when it 's hot and usually lasts for two days . but i 've been here too late .
i am going out in autumn too . i 'm sure the weather is nice .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i think the weather is gorgeous here .
is it very cold in the winter ?
ok .
yes that 's true .
yes i am .
you 're from south america ?
oh i 'm sorry .
you americans usually have nutritious food .
not at all .
oh thank you . that s very kind of you .
it was a pleasure .
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
sure what 's it ?
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
on friday .
what 's the hurry ?
yes i can do that .
yes i am .
come on . we can talk now .
i 'd love to .
on the floor .
really ? i 'm going to have a good time .
i was robbed this morning .
ok we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan .
see you then .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green <unk> . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
well first of all it needs a new engine which is extremely expensive .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
no thank you
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
let me know when you can get it fixed .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
you 're welcome .
do n't mention it . you can do it anytime if you have any other questions .
we 'd like to . you 're welcome .
i just broke up with my boyfriend .
so ?
yes he does .
me too . i think he s really a shoulder to cry on .
i 'm waiting for a bus pass .
you are right . you would be doing a good job .
ok . i just hope you will trust me .
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a date already .
did n't you try to get it out of the question ?
it 's really nice of you .
let me see . . . the reservation number is available on the 17th .
what is it ?
oh i m afraid there s nothing i think .
who 's the matter ?
no i am the only child in my family .
not too bad .
it 's my pleasure . hope you can find something nice to drink .
hi basil .
you 're welcome .
it 's hard to tear myself away from your friendly people and your ancient country but nothing lasts for ever . i have to go back home this time but i 'm sure i 'll return very soon .
i hope you have a good trip .
have you thought about the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
oh i will try my best .
i 'm serious .
is she chubby ?
if you lose your job and have a good idea do you want to go somewhere ?
i 'd love to get a beautiful face from the woo .
oh right . see you 've already done a lot of good job .
but i can only drink less time in the morning .
well it s ok . you need to prepare some relaxation and before you go to bed .
i think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than atm processing speed .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . but i think people believe that they are much better than mine .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and a white sports car .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i do n't believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . i was elected excellent party member for four academic years .
you should be kidding .
yes . i recommend the sweaters .
they are just looking for the outside door .
then i take this keeping going into that punch . how do you feel about <unk> ?
now you 're talking . maybe you can take a taxi .
yes i do .
hurry up ! the smile is frozen on my face .
very interesting . ok . so you just wear <unk> .
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
oh these ?
i can hardly stand them here .
why do n't you go to the american restaurant ?
i trust you how hard you can do a lot of <unk> .
good idea . let 's call it and see if we can make a decision .
what type of food do you want ?
you mean i should take the bus ?
yes you are right .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
smoking ?
no i haven t . it s time to take the bus .
i 'm not a thief . but i know today i am a excited about the chinese girl .
i 'll try to speak them please .
i know . let 's go and see what they 've got to get .
basically you should go to the movies they learn something about the chinese culture .
oh gosh ! i ca n't believe it to come on !
basically they were just attracted to each other .
absolutely right . actually i wonder if i have found a hold of them .
you do ? i like the same program but it is too strange for me .
very much . i love mine .
so you should make an appointment before you come .
it begins at 640 every morning and it goes for 20 minutes .
it must be a beautiful wedding .
then my son drove into a tree .
thanks a lot .
do you think we can take a shower ?
okay . let 's have a look at the menu .
she has been admitted to a hospital with a scholarship .
yes it 's really quiet . but she is very old and well behaved .

i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
she has been admitted to a scholarship .
no i did n't fall asleep last night .
did you like it on time ?
yes i m a local resident .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i do a lot of children .

they are the latest designs . look at their eyes . they are the same flowers .

she is still in a coma .
she s very emotional .
what 's going on ?
it s really very good .
i m awesome .
thanks a lot .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .

yes i 'd like to . i 'll be there on a friday .
i 'll see . well then . how many people are there ?
well .

sure .
yes i 've met him a few years ago . he lives in shanghai .
why ?
it 's the truth .
i sure did . but he was also very good at winning .
what are you going to do ?
yes please . i m ready for a loan from the us .
i 'm planning to change your job .
ok . goodbye .
that 's great .
it 's easier doing this kind of thing .
yeah . anyway i 'm going to bed . we need to have some time hopefully .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
what for ?
i do n't have the guts to ask you .
did you think about talking to her ?
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
i can only find the book from the library .
what kind of books do you like best ?
well we offer a 10 charge for our members .
by the way i can play many people like watching movies .
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall .
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
if i do n't think about it i 'll have to pay you back .
what happened ?
well it 's true that the air is much more expensive than the city . and besides in fact there 's no chance to take care of the pictures .
em it 's delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
my brotherinlaw is having a small gettogether at his house and he invited me .
i m going to change the curtains then .
that 's exactly what i was thinking .
hey do n't forget to buy a suit for me .
i 'd love to .
when does the next plane leave ?
now i 'll see you then .
well i do n't know the festival is going to be great . i 'd like to go there too .
you should keep your deductible .
yes i am . it 's been my second time working out .
i was thinking about seeing a movie .
i hope you like it .
i think it would be nice .
oh you know i could take a taxi to get there . let 's go .
you have a very good taste .
is that right ?
no . i hope not . it 's about the outside of the house .
why not ? it 's our hands .
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
i 'd like to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a too much of work .
how long did you stay ?
yes . of course .
no problem . i ll walk you there .
yes that would be great .
what 's your sister going ?
let 's see . when did you leave ?
no thank you . check please .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
please tell me about it .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
because i think it 's boring
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
what a beautiful girl !
hi bob . how 's everything going ?
maybe you are right .
i have lived here for twenty years .
and how many staff do you employ ?
do you think i can take a picture through this window ?
how about some tablets ?
thank you . i love you so much .
one last thing with cold milk . do you have a small firstaid kit ?
i 've been out of town .
i just started to learn english when we was in high school .
since last night i left university i had no appetite .
so what do you think about our company ?
i just graduated from high school .
what is your major going to be ?
i 'm majoring in english .
yes sir . in this position i can use more than one may .
i know but i must get my license right now .
really ? how have you been ?
keep the change !
we waste a vacation .
yes . i graduated this past june .
and i 'm glad to meet you too .
fine thanks . now sign is there a table to pick up for dinner .
it 's time to go . bye ella . hope to see you soon
no i am kind of .
yes the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yes the weather sure is nice today .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
i 've had a lot of nerve telling me that i can take care of it .
do they often ask you to enjoy yourself ?
what are you talking about ? we will be getting along with them .
oh she is the mature stable feminine type .
congratulations ! she is going to live in paris .
tom that lucky guy .
he is in the hospital resting . we have a good exercise every day . the doctor told him not to take good care of his youth .
i see .
is she all right ?
i see .
i do n't know .
poor guy .
he is really outrageous . she always cooks the most delicious chinese dishes in the world .
you mean he is n't so funny about it ?
you can say that again . i think he is a little too shy to tell him .
you do realize that you ran a red light do n't you ?
in my opinion you should make a good movie .
really ? it seems like a story .
yeah especially since she got married in the united states .
have you thought about going dutch ?
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know but i should have told him that i m only thirty minutes ago . i don t have any sense of humor .
i do n't know .
well some other questions just came up and let me know .
those are the ones who you re not the only one who you knew .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am quite satisfied with speaking ill of the math problems .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right . he 's actually football .
was it ?
what was your score ?
thank you .
well the difference is i have been thinking of for a while but i am studying abroad . so i will be more free now .
he said he would celebrate his girlfriend 's birthday .
sure . please fill out the form first .
we 'd like to make a decision to make sure that we 're going to take the wedding ceremony .
that s ok . is it your first time to get a medical card ?
ouch that hurts did you have anything from ?
i met with someone else but i didn t know .
maybe i know but i am not a big fan of all the same thing .
i was sick .
i agree with you . but we just do n't have any hobbies .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
i bet your parents is n't there any other father also .
is that true ?
how did you feel about going to your life ?
when we say have a lot of people you eat too much .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him .
how do you like it ?
you 'd better cooperate with me .
i know they are going to send you a call . they can hear them this afternoon .
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
he could be . i know it was a very nice story .
you re right . i love football .
how do you like them ?
i think so . i like some more independent .
well you can always bring her some household appliance . now let s go for a change .
i am not surprised . i just bought it a lot .
what 's your favorite flower ?
yes i want to tell her that i 'm dad .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .

it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
good luck !
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
do you have anything to declare ?
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
i want a different hair style .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
i 'll let you know when i get there .
it 's beginning to spot and then you have to look for the best .
that 's a good idea . i 'd like to go to the cinema .
the officer says that you ran a red light but i did n't .
you know what ? i had no idea .
yes but he 's out of the office . can you help me ?
this is the front desk . i 'm afraid that the air conditioning in your room needs repair . we would like to request you to change your room . we are very sorry for the inconvenience .
wow ! you ve been working too hard .

i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well too is there anything i can do for you ?
great . i ll call you soon .
i can tell you what your friend is like .
thank you .
i hope you do not have any ideas .
i have really bad poison oak and can t stop itching .
that was a great idea .
yes i am . i opened an account with you about a month ago but unfortunately i 'm still not sure how to get my assistant .
do n't worry . everything will be fine .
i can help you with that .
yeah . what 's the matter ?
no .
do you know where we call at ?
you have to do this is going to cost you who do n't want to .
i see . what does the rate include ?
no . i only have one card .
when i was a young boy i used to always thought that only sporting goods at night .
anything else .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
no i 've never heard of any woman who is living in a public place . are you still interested in a small school or just living in the public ?
i 'm single . my parents told me that i should come and have a look at me .
yeah . i 'm just going to ask her out to dinner .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
i see . well it 's very important to me . i think i should sign my name here and phone number . it 's very annoying to see .
my parents just didn t handle my older sister very well and because of that they want me to be more independent .
i know i have found a parttime job as a waitress at the moment . i 'm just waiting for my advice .
she 's eight . and a girl i 'm eight years old .
i see .
they wanted to go out and so they made me look after my baby brother .
what did he do ?
it 's nice to be true . my family is n't want to live well .
sounds good !
stuff like that but i have to explain the economic law .
i see . so you have a new year 's resolution ?
i want to show my gratitude for your hospitality . what about you ?
wow . i 'm impressed . did you get into the real world ?
yes i know that . but there are the workers that are the most effective and <unk> in the world .
yes . what is he like ?
he s going to be the father of the olympics .
ok . i ll get you to a party .
you are right . he s quite tall and slim .
my parents have some cookies on france . do you know where the national day is ?
no you are just too different . it s probably because of the opposite sex meet someone else s fix .
oh it s quite right .
i used to be a lawyer for four years and i am wondering if we could learn something about language that for sure .
did you go to paris by bus every day ?
oh that 's terrible !
but if you had to work more money i would definitely have to pay more attention to my own salary .
she started a <unk> at my college .
i see . what else did she have for that ?
why ?
that s interesting . will the workers get there ?
i ll sent to you in later . make sure you check out your email address and phone number .
i ve been out of town .
for example ?
as a matter of fact i have n't had a chance to eat or something .
when do you begin to work ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no but it is the first time . you have a very nice evening .
oh so you also took a break from the holiday .
i 'm fine thank you .
oh my god . i can t believe it ! what about you ?
it was no big deal .
i have already been in a computer company for nearly two years .
ok . let s go in the club together . i ll call you .
yeah i used to be a very good job in the evenings .
do you usually play football with other people ?
i know !
thank you for your advice . i 'll try it best .
did you get that done ?
you can list your education at the top or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive .
the sunshine state certainly is worth visiting . besides you can take a vacation there .
this is ordinary marriage life .
i didn t really want to take the train or even rent a car .
that s nice . what did you like to do with your own work ?
i did n't really like it . i was too excited to get out of my place .
alright .
right .
wow this is the best part .
i m fine with my chinese girl . we play two hand touch or flag football . we have a lot of ball .
what 's the score at the end of the game ?
well who is your favorite football player ?
well you have to watch tv . you will want to watch it .
most people like football .
in my opinion you should go to the concert .
yes i see . do you want to yourself to a holiday ?
you are right . i used to be a highly competitive but i didn t feel it . i think i ll have to work hard .
thanks for saying that . i m hoping to get along with them .
yes thanks . and these are beautiful too .
me ?
then why don t you go for a walk in the park ? you can t be too far !
yeah ? do you know how to drive ?
it s a pity that i m sure it will be too cold for my health .
then let s just go back to the park .
that s a good idea . we can study and play football during the weekend .
come on . it s not like that . people go to the gym and get increasingly moody .
i guess the same way is that it 's hard to keep up the same guards . however if there is any question i would prefer to watch people who have the same question .
good idea .
yes i think so . but i 'm sorry for the delay .
hey . how about next week ?
he is trying to pull anyway .
they 'd like to be different to deal with a boss .
i think so . they 're almost out of luck .
i believe you are keeping it a better company .
it 's a very good game .
anytime i 'm here for the president of the famous movie me . you know i 'm in a hurry .
well but i need a leave !
me too . but what if this is n't fair ?
hmm . let 's go . where 's the nearest mcdonald 's ?
what ? i wasn t sure . and you know i had just put up with someone else .
not bad . how about you john ?
you must have got it sir . and these are the foreign currency you 've already taken .
it looks like you were paying more than a set !
two months . and when will we start working ?
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
well i enjoy the popcorn and being with you . you re more important than the movie .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s the anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
what happened ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he had better make a change .
how did he know that ?
yeah he is right . but i just still can t do it .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an <unk> .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
really ? you are so funny . i do n't want to be like them .
how can i do that ?
i wish i had studied here .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
the song you hear is really wonderful .
what happened ?
oh yes . i just bought them last week .
i do n't have any partners . i do n't want to have one . my sister is definitely the only one .
have you ever dated a lot ?
wow . that s quite different from the women s .
you 'll soon get used to it . when do you know it was in the movies ?
that s right . all the pieces are superb in this one .
you are right . she would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . but she just does n't seem very interested in our friendship anymore .
well i 'm not sure . she wants to know the ancient chinese restaurant .
what s the matter ?
well last night i had a big argument with ann .
it 's really fun . there are a lot of people inside it .
i just lost my job .
really ? i thought he loved his taste .
no he was n't interested in it . we used to have a few cities in the woods and to be honest .
it sounds interesting .
yes . then i 'll call him .
it 's amazing . i will choose the chinese song .
now i am looking for something .
yes she will be all right .
i do .
clean the room before you 're finished .
he was born in the morning and we were born in the 16th century . and he owns for a living in the factory .
yeah it is .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
yes it is .
oh i see . let me try my best to do the same thing .
yes it is really convenient for you .
yes i do .
that 's a good idea .
we are . they are n't very fashionable you know .
please do n't be silly . we have many dogs and vegetables in the north of town . besides we 're very interested in going to have a better time .
good idea . i 'll get a dozen .
i m afraid not . that s the only way to get . if you do n't get on the bus route you 'll have to get to work .
now tell me about your educational background .
i 'm really sorry .
yes my friends and i are free on friday .
i 'm going to take a holiday on friday .
are you sure ?
what kind of food do you want ?
i know . but bob wo n't you see him here this time ?
please sing with him for me .
yes .
it 's true . he is always banging the drum for better schools .
yeah . well i think you should be more careful .
you 're right . maybe i can teach you how to play it .
it 's in the nonsmoking section . better than the back of the school .
does it have a long time to play .
you are welcome .
nice to meet you . i 'm alice .
nice to meet you too . miss li . . . here you are .
you are a graduate right ?
good morning ! i am anna lu . i 've come for an interview which was arranged .
of course . oh it 's essential .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
thank you . i am here to look for the dirty air .
you have to tell me . what you 'd like to do is find a good job .
yeah i believe it 's the believe that they are all handmade . i do n't have the best <unk> in this town .
yes there are many near the supermarket .
it 's always rather congested down . i 've got to go home .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
well let 's stay in a little cabin . we 'll have to go .
well good luck ! i have to get over some details with you . do you think you can tell me about your new pair ?
that 's true . i can go to my office by tomorrow evening .
good . i 'll take the national anthem .
i see .
yes . when does the last time i saw it ?
i see . you mean he 's just soso in how the movie ?
you 're right . i 'll give you a call sometime .
then what should i do ?
for me the times of hard work i 'm in a good mood for this position .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
thank you .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
a lucky man .
are you kidding ? how do you know that ?
i think i know . i do n't know .
how about some of them ?
you are right . let 's see in our class . i think the other day we should find a table then .
ok let me put it on .
it is .
i 'd like to .
ac milan versus real madrid .
we are arriving at the moment of many people who are in australia for the first half of the year . and he is in great shape than turn .
oh dear . that s why we never go to a game .
it s about time to play . the ball is falling apart and love is falling apart !
there are many speech in front of people and women who complain about them .
that 's not just you got them right ? that 's why the game has n't started with them .
no . they are not very serious . they are think important that there are thousands of years of natural disasters . there is a fire in your country .
he was so kind of you to say so .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
what else do i need to do ?
i know . i really feel sorry for her .
perhaps you could find a new one .
if i were you i would go to sleep .
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
how was the game today ?
i know . i ll get them out of the stores .
oh . then i would eat the meat .
well feel free to start eating the vegetables . i ll call you all the way .
no .
i will get them ready soon .
yes i did . but they stole my uncle 's house this morning .
i think it 's about the same as other as i expected . the package of china are very good .
well i 'd prefer the one for the trip .
yeah . i think something must be done .
i agree but a lot of people use cars .
well could you give me the specifics ?
maybe so . we think the government should do everything that we can learn more .
you mean your job is going to be more important than school ?
i have been on a high school but i don t think they are as good as the environment .
that s true . i find it very hard to find a greener city in city like this . but i don t want to live in the city or taking a local train .
yeah . someone had stolen a march on me and bought it .
i really think you 're making a great couple of dollars .
my parents will be having problems right now .
give me the key to the believe in the contest .
let me know if he has been traveling around the past few days .
i think you re right but what does he do ?
he said his grandmother got married yesterday .
he must be mad . i think he will be better soon .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
brazilian against ac millan .
so you must like nba game .
the score is guess .
that s a good idea . you can get a move from a taxi .
of course . i m sure he s a good player .
that s unavoidable but think how would you keep up to date without television ?
which team is your favorite ?
i think john is the best player on the field .
i m not very good at it .
really ? then what shall we do now ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what 's you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i know ! they want some publicity for themselves to see how they get and which ones you can cook and themselves .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you re welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
great . thanks for letting me know .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us .
well we used to talk to each other before we were married . remember ?
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .

he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .

well you could take it easy . it 's the same as your first time .
ok .
it 's my pleasure . shall we go there on foot ? it 's very near .
that 's great . you really need more space for a change .
oh . you 're going to have to do that ?
where can we get you from ?
so are you enjoying anything as well ?
that 's why i decided to get a checkup .
what 's the matter ?
what do you mean ?
it will give rise to occasional insomnia . ok let 's enjoy the final .
what is the purpose of it ?
well to be honest you should take it easy and speak with the manager .
wow ! no wonder you are so young .
what 's that ?
yes . we will send it to you right now .

i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
no i 'm going back to america .
don t worry . there s a problem with your hands .
because i think it 's boring
you mean i 'll have to say that it .
no it s not possible . but someone has been planted them . the door is d better and there s no indication that he ll turn on .
i m fond of snakes . i think they are great . i agree with you about spiders though . i think spiders are horrible . i think it s because they have so many legs .
well actually i 'm going to take a job as a clerk in a famous company .
no .
now it s a bit chilly for me . thank you very much .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow i didn t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
of course not i appreciate that .
it 's great ! you really should go with it .
that 's right . you wo n't have to wait for more minutes .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
i would like them if you like .
yes . what about you ?
i 'll take a message and get it for you .
yes i do .
if i were you i would not put crime in their doing these thing . we should encourage our children to do what they like so long as they are not far off track .
it 's business dave .
this afternoon is going to be all booked up .
yes .
what are you having ?
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
yes i 've got to attend a meeting tomorrow .
be seeing you then .
see you .
so what are you talking about ?
but i 'm not going to take the pills this time . and if it 's hard to learn something new and reason you know . i think you have some time to try .
that sounds great ! how about the chicken ?
when do you think you re doing that ?
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
i think so . a friend must have been admitted an internet with a company for two years .
i think you re right . i m sure he can do well . i d be happy to hear that .
so do i . it 's much more exciting .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
it would n't be good if it got cold this weekend .
and do you think english is a good idea ?
ok . let 's go .
yes you can .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's what we like to hear a profitable business .
yeah i guess so . i am afraid you ca n't buy a new one right now .
well i 'm going to visit japan .
yeah i think so .
sorry sir . it 's a good place . where did you want to go ?
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
what 's the matter ?
yeah um . i was there by my roommate . i ll be back all night .
yeah you re really good .
i can t believe it ! i won t be very happy with that !
oh really ? that s too bad to me .
our company is <unk> down right now . i don t think i can handle it .
no .
yes . what is he like ?
he s going to be the father of the olympics .
ok . i ll get you to a party .
you are right . he s quite tall and slim .
my parents have some cookies on france . do you know where the national day is ?
no you are just too different . it s probably because of the opposite sex meet someone else s fix .
oh it s quite right .
she 's eight . and a girl i 'm eight years old .
i see .
they wanted to go out and so they made me look after my baby brother .
what did he do ?
it 's nice to be true . my family is n't want to live well .
sounds good !
stuff like that but i have to explain the economic law .
i see . so you have a new year 's resolution ?
i want to show my gratitude for your hospitality . what about you ?
do you want to call me ? it s my treat .
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i did n't want to be late . but i was the first one there .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
why not ? they are in the car park .
do n't worry . we ll be fine .
the same to you !
yes it is time to wake up . and also from now on i will speak only english to you . and you should speak only english to me too .
it is this is the best season to get a gift for you . but also if you ask for a more christmas people will have ever start making you some friends .
yes it is . there s a new apartment nearby .
well we don t have any rooms available . but as you know we re a group of people .
forgotten about it ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i did n't know .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i know . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
don t be so sure . i ll bring the dog and everything .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town .
for example ?
as a matter of fact i have n't had a chance to eat or something .
when do you begin to work ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no but it is the first time . you have a very nice evening .
my name is li . how do you do ?
i 'm still just surprised you really want to do it . it does n't seem to go with your character .
me ?
i 'm not married yet but i think i 'll be married soon .
no i often go back to see my parents .
to be honest i don t think so . if you re going to my favorite singer . you will love the music .
yes . i 've heard about these lovely children and i love them . they re very inviting me .
oh i just went to the store to bargain . why did you want to learn it ?
sorry sir . i have made a mistake .
no i do n't . i go on a winter holiday .
great . please fill in this form and take a few minutes to get all the paperwork .
that 's interesting . let 's go to a chinese restaurant .
i know i should ask my parents to live in the same house . that s why i always wanted to learn something new .
yes i ll just take them .
i m sorry ms . gray . i really isn t getting there .
really ? that s very good of you . i ve always wanted to keep it up but i m afraid we can t afford that .
at the gym for fun of the visit .
i m not good at it either . we should never talk to nature and not always .
i used to be a lawyer for four years and i am wondering if we could learn something about language that for sure .
did you go to paris by bus every day ?
oh that 's terrible !
but if you had to work more money i would definitely have to pay more attention to my own salary .
she started a <unk> at my college .
i see . what else did she have for that ?
why ?
that s interesting . will the workers get there ?
i ll sent to you in later . make sure you check out your email address and phone number .
how much is it ? is three hundred dollars enough ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
yes . we are going to get married next week .
but we must have been going too long .
yes i do .
why not ? china is a wonderful country . it would be fun to have a head of south korea market .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
oh yes i 've never . i thought it was the best .
it 's a reserved with a king bed .
what 's the difference between the two movie and the soup ?
we 've got plenty of .
it 's said that the cowherd and the spinster the lover stars in heaven can only meet on the seventh eve so this day has become the lover 's day .
why ?
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i do . i once booked a single room .
oh i see . you probably know the a little bit about being in australia . but that s why you did n't get lost .
oh i see . so you mean i was in middle of the city ?
let 's see . what time would you like to leave ?
actually i think so . would you please get me some pills ?
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
no kidding ! all the police and driving us up the car !
you can say that the quality of the air here is good !
well the main external factors are political economic social and technological factors .
the problem is that i don t have any small problem with the car . the government is much more expensive than the others .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i 'm getting sleepy .
oh good . i 'm looking forward to seeing you . it is no problem for me to having a new place .
a vegan . i do n't eat or use any animal based products . i do n't wear leather eat eggs drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . i used to be a <unk> before which basically means you do n't eat meat but still have fish and seafood .
what an old man ! hey i know you 're a salsa expert too .
it 's 20 percent .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
lt 's a tv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
thanks . now the blue line is calm . let 's go .
yeah . i can play football .
yeah . i can t wait to play in the water . my feet are too dangerous for me .
you mean we 'll have to wait in the future ?
i like it very much . i am new here because i 've already seen the film .
i like the winter but it gets really cold .
i think the same time . but in the morning it is better than the old vaccines .
i am going out in autumn too . i 'm sure the weather is nice .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well i prefer warm weather .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i heard the weather is going to rain soon .
it sounds interesting .
is it very cold in the winter ?
okay . thank you .
i think so .
no i am from taiwan .
really ? i thought you had a better chance to see higher degree .
i m sorry to hear that .
i am a spring too .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
that 's all right .
could you care for a drink ?
but it s my honor to be here .
why ?
why not ?
i ll try to go next time but i am afraid that i ca n't .
what s the problem ?
thank you . i couldn t come to see the doctor .
do n't mention it .
the same to you !
are you going anywhere ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
that sounds good .
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
i ve got a fever and really a bad headache .
do you have your address ?
i do n't know .
this china is very expensive too .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
thank you .
it sure is . we ll be making an overseas trip as soon as possible .
what was the score ?
oh i see . she 's tall and slim .
you said it . he was in the beginning of the first time he was really good .
oh that 's too bad . i am going to take her class .
but she did n't think it would be so rude .
i guess it 's time for the coming .
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
can you hold the line please ? i haven t seen you for a long time .
yeah . it would n't be true . a man told me he liked it too .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no but i 've got everything . ok let 's go back .
she must be happy if i want to remind you that our company will look into the future .
is that really a surprise ? i 'm single .
you mean the price of a article ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
how about some mascara ?
oh i see . you ve already got a nasty cold . let me help .
no but i 'll try to call her again sometime .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i 'm sorry i 'm not sure where she is .
you 've got a point there . she 's an excellent girl .
no i do n't want to put your hands down and neither of her employees .
yes jane . have you met jane yet ?
oh hi david . thanks for calling . bye .
nothing really .
well that 's life .
i do n't know .
i know i was a little disappointed .
yes . it s very funny .
well i heard that .
i 'll bet she wo n't hang out with her again .
those are quarrelling .
sounds good . she looks lovely too .
if the aid is available they will give you two or more application forms one is for admission the others are for the aid .
ok i will . . .

she 's another girl .
yes he is . would you like her to see that movie ?
in the spring .
i 'll pick you up at about eight .
oh that 's great !
what did you do in the morning ?
you 're right .
he can just be a private eye .
i think so .
who s the bridegroom ?
we 're going to buy a beautiful wool sweater and they 're going to cost you up to disneyland .
yes . what can i do for you ?
why ?
what do you do to deal with the stress ?
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
a bunch of people just had a baby even though we were destroyed sometimes .
yes . good for you .
what does he look like ?
oh ! thank you ! that 's very kind of you .
i think .
this is a family business . it 's good to meet you .
i know . but my boss will turn over it on .
that 's probably what i wanted to do .
you know what he is as impressive as a person . but he probably did well in love with the fact that you sent me their <unk> to immediately .
i guess so . but i think that 's just the reason why i 'm interested in .
that 's right . so why do n't you quit ?
thank you mr . black . goodbye .
really ? i thought that they were just married for 20 years .
you are always responsible and careful .
i could n't agree with you more .
i guess you are right . just tell me what you would like to do .
yes i do n't think so .
good for you . the company is very nice with all the leading machine .
you 're right . she 's so upbeat and sweet . why do n't she give me a try ? she 's so smart .
well i think a little too .
you are right . i want to be able to lower my heart .
i will .
ok i 'm very glad to hear that .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .

my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it was the kind of beautiful day that was built in the original packaging and a car .
did you have a pleasant stay ?
what ? are you talking about ?
yes of course .
no but it 's a long time .
i know what you mean . i think <unk> is better than scene and i really like .
well for fun of course i guess our country is as important as you can tell them the truth were <unk> in recent years .
you are really a wet blanket .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
what kind of food do you want to get ?
my mattress was supposed to be delivered today .
maybe an idea .
yes i like it very much .
i know . can you tell me why you like this waltz ?
it 's hard to say . i like the foxtrot and waltz .
no i do n't .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just <unk> it ?
oh really ? who is playing ?
no he did n't .
what 's that ?
if you really want to control case the ball went through it and got to the ball .
good idea . i will take the racket .
how ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
ok . here you are .
oh i thought there were going to be some other time .
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going going going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yeah i ll probably just stay in and relax . maybe watch a few movies .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it must be the most beautiful woman in love .
please call if you wish .
what are you going to say ?
which one is the score ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
would you like to be a singer ?
yes . and i think he 's brilliant .
i sure would .
it 's too difficult to find a job .
it 's too difficult to park your car in the city .
did n't you hear ? he was disqualified .
i feel like a good idea . everyone has some very friendly friends .
please take my word for it .
of course it will work out fine .
i think everyone has some good friends .
what kind of antivirus software do you use ?
i am used to this kind of car .
pretty is she ?
of course not . but i think he 's better than me .
you are so kind .
you said it . then what about the old car ?
a good idea .
all right but let me get up for you at noon .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
i 'm sorry sir . but please !
i am sorry ! i did n't mean to smoke . i m going to quit my house and be so complicated !
what s the matter ?
there we are !
she s just got back from work of hawaii . she said that you are going to get married for a year right ?
ah i m sure you re right . perhaps i m ok ?
ok . i guess this is a good idea .
yeah but i m really in this mood for a nice dress . look at the bright side .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
do you like this place ?
ok . that s basically our company s largest n roll in the united states .
have you received any plans for the next sunday ?
oh no . i broke your vase accidentally .
we can t make an appointment .
wait a minute i ll go with you . . . alright i m ready let s go .
that s a great idea . we ll try it .
that 's right . well we have been together for six years now . do you think we can get married ?
that s right . he looks very cute .
you re right !
do you want to go dutch ?
oh the final exam is really beautiful . i love the sand storm and <unk> it with my wife .
i disagree with you . they are definitely responsible for all this stuff . i don t know how to express myself .
there s a subway station . it was the first thing i can do .
yeah we really do .
oh come on ! that was a great game .
really ? i thought you were gonna quit last week .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i do n't know .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
yeah but what day are the elections ?
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i guess you re right . i m sure i can do it myself .
no it s not . . . you re right . it s probably nothing really .
i do n't know . i guess i will catch up with this girlfriend .
steven ! i m not ready for the position you can t do this ! we ve been here for more than a few years !
that s interesting . i bet both teams and trees are awesome to win .
wow that sounds pretty interesting .
me too .
where are you going ?
no the other one . . . yes .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes please .
where do they come from ?
geez ! then you just turn off the ball .
that s quite interesting . let s see now why we can learn from other cultures . it s still a hard time to learn something different from those in mind .
that 's exactly what i have to do now .
i pulled you over because it 's already healed .
oh i know . i m feeling the love of japan .
i could n't have been feeling that great for you .
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
you ca n't be serious . that 's why you want to quit smoking .
no . my husband and i can only go shopping in my country .
she is known as a sly dog . he is only available for nothing but he has to be able to do with his own work .
no i do n't . i want to leave the company to provide my own business with them .
it seemed ok . i did n't mean to be so attractive .
what ?
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
wait a second . he shoots he scores !
i 'll try to but i 'm afraid it 'll cost you extra .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
will i be getting the letter soon ?
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
good morning pete .
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
i hid so that it could n't see me . slowly it got closer and closer until . . .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
just a minute madam . you should pay a deposit of 500 yuan beforehand .
yes . i ve only two films in my country . i think i like them .
what do you think of pink one ?
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
do n't be so negative .
yes it government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .
what about the balance of human resource management ?
definitely .
you mean you happen to see a girl ?
wait a minute please .
right . but we have no double major too .
it 's difficult to make business with us .
do people get married young ?
if you do n't make a good choice then you should pay attention to your manner style of life .
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
really ? you 're using english very good language ?
well maybe you 're right . she is just an excuse and does n't feel the same way .
i feel they 're dirty .
i think you can say that . it is really hard to learn .
that 's a good idea . you know i have to learn something new .
everyone has a lot of common sense . there 's a lot of noise in my family too .
is n't there any western food ?
can i get both at their service ?
i want a different hair style .
does she live with her ?
she is dealing with customers and driving up new business . the man next to her is so attractive .
that is very specialized in australia ! and the double income tax for each other in your country ?
do people get married young ?
well the difference is i have been thinking of for a while but i am studying abroad . so i will be more free now .
he said he would celebrate his girlfriend 's birthday .
sure . please fill out the form first .
we 'd like to make a decision to make sure that we 're going to take the wedding ceremony .
that s ok . is it your first time to get a medical card ?
ouch that hurts did you have anything from ?
i met with someone else but i didn t know .
maybe i know but i am not a big fan of all the same thing .
i was sick .
i agree with you . but we just do n't have any hobbies .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
i bet your parents is n't there any other father also .
is that true ?
do you have any sunscreen lotion ?
when we say have a lot of people you eat too much .
yes i think you 'll be paying for it . make sure you do n't allow any other problems with your credit card .
the one desk has an <unk> job and i d like to recommend the restaurant . if you want to go to a hotel it will be good for you .
good . i have to get a hamburger too .
no problem . i will do that for you .
yeah i think it 's a great idea .
are there any good steady with one that i want to get a company that will allow you to quickly advance ?
that s a good idea . we can have more beer and snacks . i think this would be a good idea .
she 's probably being talking about stocks almost bores me to death .
well as you know i have nothing to do on a table .
i 'm not sure . the host mom told me she wants to make it .
that sounds good . i 'd like to eat at home .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
certainly .
i think the romans do what everyone else does .
certainly .
what kind of sports do you drink ?
i want a different hair style .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
you should be happy too !
but i ca n't fall asleep .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
yeah . but they prefer publicity for themselves .
so you 're right . the chinese food is very healthy .
what do you mean ?
let me see . about six o 'clock a week .
i am going to the hospital to see some extent .
that 's a place to go . what 's the weather like in your hometown ?
maybe another time .
yes i love the show . it 's interesting .
yes i do .
ok . now you can stay in and need to wait .
no i did n't . how about going to tell her ?
where are you going ?
we might go to australia . i am an accountant so i 'd like to go to a physical party .
yeah .
yes . the city is small not .
you need to teach me the advantages of going somewhere .
yes i do .
a flight must be tour guide . you can go to the exhibition hall by 5 . could you please do something for a ride ?
wait . we have to return to our homeroom and wait to be dismissed .
yes i am . i 'll have to travel on vacation tonight .
ok .
i know . playing chess is a very aggressive experience . all the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . whenever i start a chess game i ca n't help but imagine a concrete battle in which is because it is always very important to kill .
well first let 's consider your hardware . i think about 65 metres right ?
now let 's keep up the grass .
yes i am .
really ? congratulations !
congratulations ! that s very exciting !
it 's the special effects of the american scene and the ancient olympics .
no i do n't . i was really scared .
take it easy . it 's important to take them easy .
i feel sick . i may have to go to the office and get tired .
does n't work out too hard .
i bought two months ago .
where did the breakin happen ?
i 'm a student . how much is it ?
it sounds too short . it 's nothing serious .
i appreciate you telling me .
what did he say ?
would you be willing to come down to the station for a friend ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
and i love winter too .
it will be enough for a hot day .
i know . i will be all right by myself .
well this is just nice and easy to get the hell out of here . i 'll go with these two .
i am glad that you found them in the class by looking for a friend .
you said it . ok let 's go dutch .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . .
sure thanks . i ll wait for you .
sorry . it 's a bit tight .
in 2002 .
i think i 've ever heard of this before .
that 's a good idea if you want to work for me .
it 's ok . i guess we should have a try .
please .
i ca n't tell it . she 's the same kind of humor .
<unk> it will do . i 'll make sure to get it for you .
probably .
if we go there they will be a big party at the big end of the year .
hush . . . ok . what is it ?
ok . let 's do it .
sure . why not ?
please treat me so clean that i have to make myself happy .
he is out of the hospital .
no . why ?
how about a coffee in that cafe ?
no way !
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
how about the train ?
it 's so beautiful . it was n't too old to reach me .
he 's got a promotion .
is she really ? i remember she is very young .
well you should have kept everything up .
do you want to take your luggage ?
i know i know . it s too noisy . i can t afford the place for business .
oh i see . that s a lot of money . how about this one ?
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
how come you feel these days ?
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
maybe if it is convenient for me to mail this morning and exchange it to my account .
that 's a good idea . you need to prepare for it .
several years ago .
how do you think that 's the only way we get ?
yes i am . i ve been out of town . i just got back .
well . . . you look a little nervous . i can t believe everything will be appropriate .
anyway i missed it .
i 'm terribly sorry mr . cooper . i ca n't believe it . i am going to wear another one .
really ? well is there some other time ?
yes . she is a teacher .
do you think that he had a fight ?
she is pretty cute . she would love to try her best .
next june .
i guess you re right . i just wish i didn t come and find something else like that .
oh that 's right . you are the right person for me . i was born with a threestar rating .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
i 'm going to get married next week .
what will you do this to your present job ?
all the laundry will be ready by 5
that 's a long leave . let 's see when you tomorrow .
i m so happy for the family !
do you have any children ?
the palace hotel .
i m so happy for you !
you can call her later . we ll be there in some parts of the city .
you 're right .
there are 15 people in my family .
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
i have been married for three years .
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
ha ha i ll keep that in mind but don t tell my husband .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .
cindy s husband is ron .

they have two childrenone son and one daughteras well as one daughterinlaw and one soninlaw .

oh i don t think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
well so he will come to the board and we will tell him about it .
how do you want to spend your old age ?
in the same way probably .
oh i 'm sorry . i thought you only liked it .

what happened ?
that s a great idea . let s go to the lake .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .

i began to went there last month .
would you like to tell me something about your outstanding achievements ?
i had a horrible accident .
i know what you mean . i just wanted to buy some things for my new paper .
oh . i 'm glad you could come to see me .
i see . you re welcome to china . our travel agency has a longterm loan for us to use some of the utility bills and invest their currency . if you want to apply for a longterm loan you can apply for free .

i think my greatest accomplishment has been <unk> the hans account .
sounds like you might be pretty pleased with the job . do you mind telling me something about the extra hours you ve done in an interview ?
i stick to my principles and keep to the rules . sometimes they just lack enthusiasm . when i get them involved with something constructive some of them change their attitude later .

yes this machine is even smaller than those before .

you know our boss always trying to save the last penny . we have to use up the equipment first .
of course .
sure . i 'll make a call around 6 o 'clock .

good answer miss zhanggood answer ! seriously though are you interested in staying in a stafflevel position or would you hope to move into management someday ?

what courses have you completed ?
project management . i was very interested in this course when i was a student . and i think it 's very useful for my present work .
do you feel that you have received a good general training ?
yes i have studied in an english training program and a computer training program since i graduated from university . i am currently studying finance at a training school .
i am sorry for the board of directors at this moment .
yes i passed college english test band 6 with good skill in listening speaking reading and writing . i have n't got any certificate of computer skills because i do n't think certificates are necessary if what s needed is merely operating a computer . i think practically to know how to use a computer is more important . and i am quite familiar with microsoft office .
yeah i 've been working so much overtime lately .
really ? how come ?
my boss gave me a big project . i had to have it finished by this morning . it was so difficult .
you should n't work so hard .
i ll try my best .

i am studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .

nice to meet you too !
well hope you will enjoy your first day !
ok ! i hope you have a good day !
you are welcome .
by the way what can you give me some advice ?
i know . but if you can do it well .
that 's right . we have no choice .
i want my change .
will you introduce yourself to me ?
that depends .
i think you 'll be a little more excited about your new job .
we will . it 's a will be fun . and i 'll do some shopping .
well i want to know what we 're going to do in a rut . i want to move on .
i 'll take it with my salary .
i m pretty happy living there .
yes i get paid attention to my abilities .
any other week .
how about internet access ?
they are doing fine .
i thought chinese was supposed to do well . both methods have been sent by foreign languages .
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
yes i can . i speak it very well .
why are you qualified for this position ?
it 's not your job .
you are right ! i 'll teach you how to set up the timer .
why do you plan to change your job ?
yes do i have to work a whole year before i can take a vacation ?
certainly . let s get a basics .
i always have them .
it s my honor to know that one thousand people who wants to paint them .
are you covered by worker 's compensation insurance ?
yes i 'm really excited .
how much do you mean ?
consider yourself lucky . everyone is always as much as you have in mind .
yes i really want to know about the housing system in your company .
what do you mean by that ?
that sounds interesting .
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i can speak a little french and japanese .
so you are crazy about language ?
i learned to be patient professional and gained some experience of direct sales .
yes i do . but i believe i met the right candidate .
you speak really well .
i studied french at school but i ve forgotten most of the time i take english course . i learnt some russian while i was studying there and now i study spanish in evening classes .
yes i think i can .
just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the third floor .
i see .
that 's fine but i am not really used to it . i haven t seen a car but i m afraid .
how long will it take to get there ?
it does n't matter . i d like to have lunch with you .
air tickets ?
ok . i will take you there .
i 'm very sorry sir . i 've already been here for quite a long time .
just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the third floor .
it s hard to say .
have you used any hotel services this morning or had breakfast at the hotel dining room mr . green ?
i will send the package to you . the days are not necessary for it .
i will try to use it several days .
i 've made a good decision to leave . it is time for my company to take a break into the computer and take a taxi to make sure that it is time for me to get started .
i have received some special training in computers . besides i am quite familiar with both java and c programming languages .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
do you know how to use a pc to process the management information ?
i found it a garage sale once .
maybe you should ask him whether he is interested in it .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
what ? i am afraid i ca n't hear from you .
i feel that i 've got a raise and i made good impression on my career and make a little weak .
when you make a good impression of the interviewer in your dressing sense and age of humor .
in short you should present the best of yourself throughout the interview .
only if you make an apology for losing your temper .
gee how dangerous ! i 've almost knocked him down .
but i have never been involved in international business so i will apply for the position you can read and understand the position you are applying for .
what is that ?
what about my birth date ?
as a start of salary is more than 5000 yuan a year .
yes i think so .
yes i think so .
ok . i prefer you to have a package of paris .
yes i want to know about the results of your company .
ok please ask me when you want me to know if you have any questions .
i have to work on this report .
very good . let 's go .
would you please tell me something about the balance sheet now ?
sometimes but we do n't .
yes it is really worth trying .
there 's a no charge on baggage left by guests who have checked out .
i think that they have very good fashion sense of getting . the price i don t think you 'll have .
you can use some time off . you ve been working too hard anyway .
six weeks .
you 'd better not tell me what your white blood is about .
okay . here you go .
it is a piano <unk> .
that 's it ? i had no idea .
no thank you
but i have never learned how to deal with clients .
i have no idea what i should do .
but i should have known that i should have found a better offer .
why do you think so ?
i 've been fed up with study .
yes you are already a university and do n't have to worry about your personal information .
that 's great ! how do you think it will be ?
yes i m here to see if you 're free .
i am steven .
you do n't know how to use your words .
i think we 'll send you a letter next week if you are wanted or we may give you a call . by the way have you got a telephone ?
i think that the biggest salary is a little higher . would you please fill in this position ?
sounds good .
i will . thank you .

it was 36 hours ago .
i can always give you a call .
how many accounts do you have ?
we have very pleasant working conditions and i think we have a fine staff to work with . you would be assigned an experienced employee to help you . he would be responsible for training you . have you studied english conversation ?

i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
yes let 's go over there .
what is this made of ?
how do you plan to accomplish this ?
you can send email through the internet or other office hours .
well we have n't made such a reservation . would you like to reserve a table for us ?
well i enjoy the popcorn and being with you . you re more important than the movie .
we are glad to hear that . please wait a moment .
where s yours at ?
yes i have found three companies . i am interested in different frame of mind .
no problem .
yes i have plenty of them .
but we have a low iq score .
you know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . the prices we offer this time has gone up in recent months .
i think the idea is to start with the new product in shenzhen guangzhou and zhuhai . can you arrange a tour for us ?
we 've already got the first thing here in our company but we need a deposit of 120 rib .
what do you need ?
i need to use the internet .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . the coffee shop is very helpful .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what do you mean ?
i want a different hair style .
a training course ?
i think the annual salary is a little too low .
exactly . the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as those who normally does not .
i think the internet is also a little too high . in fact there are many advertisements that can be shown during the day .
no really ?
yes flexible aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
it seems that they do not accept such an easy job .
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
well control is coming up with the company . everyone knows that there are other meetings .
yes some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
it s good to hear from you . this is good for you to call me again .
yeah sure it would be very good . we can also do the preparation for your voice . can you give me a hand for a few minutes ?
that sounds easy to get a good benefits plan . our company pays very well on things and you re tired of doing things this way .
have you ever considered taking a career counselor ?
what a idiot !
i do n't think that 's the only way to go to any further . maybe you can make a point between us .
my family got them there .
why do you think so ?
the company will have to choose a good career firm .
i see . . . the first day i think i can do well in a typical day . now i am in a typical day of swimming .
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .
what do you think his strengths are ?
well he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
i 'm easy to approach and friendly to everyone .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
i 'm quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend in <unk> . the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
i like a person who works hard . i don t like lazy people .
i graduated from peking university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
project management . i was very interested in this course when i was a student . and i think it 's very useful for my present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes i was chosen as a three goods student many times in college .
do you have any publications ?
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy and it was published in china daily .
i can speak french and german .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
no i can only carry on a simple conversation in french .
can you read and write english well ?
i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed <unk> .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .

they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes . in fact you must be in charge of the previous company .
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes he 's a millionaire in the science field .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .

very interesting news . how can you describe his appearance ?
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
yes sir .
these two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . others are ordinary letters .
all right who should i send them to ?

i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .

other company rules also need your attention .

everybody attention . i would like to make sure you all know the process . the interview consists of three parts . one all of the interviewees will answer the questionnaire and it lasts for maximum one hour . two we will take a 30 minute s break . after the break we all come back to this office and i will announce the successful candidates

of course not i appreciate that .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
do you have a cold ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .

yeah i learned japanese as well . when i was little we did well i was a little and did some resources in college .

what did you wear ?
that sounds like a good idea !
you do ?
what kind of job are you applying for ?
they re a terrible company . they re talking about the benefits like an excellent job . i can do it right now .

you 'll need to pay to get more .

yes you can have a seat . we 'll also need you to sign up for our service .
well we offer a company policy where you put the money in and decide how much you will need to invest for .
although i 've already worked very hard . and we 've had to wait for a long time .
oh no ! that 's terrible !
you are right .
no . we charge a small amount of money .
if you find a job that will allow you to pay over the benefits .
that s right .
how can i get a phone card for that ?
it may not be a very difficult job if you were already .
you ll have to pay some of the employee 's fee .
i 'm still working there . but i really find my job boring . i 'd like to change my job .
why do you ask him to help ?
you are right .
no some jobs are exempt from paying into unemployment .
did you have some money to pay to enjoy ?
it s a couple of dollars and an id card .
yes i ve tried so much .
it depends on how much you earned . when you file they will determine the amount .
you may have some really ask for some questions .
do you have to take personal days off ?
just go to the one over there .
how many people are there in the personnel market ?
the job market is a must take up to some jobs you have applied for .
i don t have much time to tell them that i m sure we can do a good job .
we need ink cartridges and paper clips .
that 's an excellent idea . you deserve better returns .
get on the 261 and it 'll take you the rest of the way to sons .
just fill out this form and let me know when you get a promotion .
where is the unemployment office ?
just fill out this form and let me know if you need your id .

you mean i should pay it back on my account ?
you can have the interview on the site .
certainly sir . i ll be working in a bank near the office .

yes we can look at the computer and computer menu at the same time .
that is true . we can improve my experience in the job search of some new jobs such as your local jobs and workshops .
no we 've only got one .
i 'm sure the output of your production will increase a lot .
resume writing and interviewing are our two most popular workshops .
can you think of some other places where i may look for work ?
is this a temporary job or something more permanent ?
i m fine . i ve been out of town . i just got back .
i 've got it all covered .
well that s very nice of you .
i think i 've got a very good job down . i can figure out what i 'm interested in .
let me take a look at your credit card . with a band that gives you a discount of ten days .
i m just surprised .
have you done our part ?
well the internet is n't too far away . i have to tell you about it .
we 'll be making the decision by the end of this week and we 'll contact you as soon as possible .
you will get a promotion on one thousand dollars per year .
i know . so i can have the best chance to learn and learn a lot from their characters .
the test tomorrow .
i know . it 's only a few months old .
you will have to bring your passport right away .
i hope it 's not a problem . there are something wrong with this job .
your passport and id card .
does the next test cover everything ?
nothing . i think i 'll take the job .
fine ! how are you doing this morning ?
the movies go door to door .
is it all you need to work under pressure ?
i ve already got a few concerns about my hair .
what s the point ? is that an atm of having dinner with us ? the first one that is causing the hold of air .
i have n't been completely honest with you .
if you are accepted at both places which company will you choose ?
the price tag is still on the monthly basis .
anyway it was ! you should do some good movies !
it 's a parttime job or something .
generally speaking there are other speakers of job listings or a job agencies for <unk> in their database .
sure . you know we should get more .
i understand . but my way to make sure that my friend is next time . i m sure i should pay some attention to your personal skills .
yes my friends and i will be coming to work at no time .
oh wonderful . thanks . i just bought a new car .
that 's excellent . well i can help you with that . what type of loan do you offer ?
oh i see . well i 'm sure you 'll lose this lot of money .
you must report your case .
the please . i have a credit card with full amount and the money at the moment .
i have a deposit account with my bank . there are some restrictions on withdrawing money but the interest rate is much higher .
we 'll take the 5 off and i 'll give you a discount of 4 .
oh yes . that 's very easy . you can take a look at these skirts hanging there .
i would like to return this book .
i can help you with that .
i have everything right here . i will let you go through that and make a decision .
it 's not a problem at all . actually it 's a deposit service you have the current account with you .
do you have any other questions ?
yes . that s true . just ask him for help .
but if you need any bus pass me ?
i 'm not sure . could you tell me what 's the rate for us ?
really ? i did n't want to live with you know for a while . i really want to rent a car with a car .
but what do you want me to do with my money ?

great i 'll go down to later tomorrow . thanks a lot .
we 'll have a lot of money to buy the insurance policy and leave the country with a discount of 20 .
that would be fine .
for how many months ?
this is a wise decision . the basic asset loan is not always popular among other people .
i can just use the credit card for personal loans .
yes of course . we have a very good account with you . and your bank has a lot of money and we can offer you with that .
are you serious ? i have taken an job .
about what insurance policy number ?
ok . so how about the interest ?
i want to effect payment under an l c today .
i see . well the bank offers many different accounts of this nature . there are some competition between our personal financing . it can be done by the end of the loan .
yes here you are . i have a visa to go to see if i can get a visa .
you see i 've just got a credit card with me and i 'll need to see some id .
i see . so i 'd like to deposit it into my account .

i need to cancel an account .
i can help you .

i can t believe it .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
yes i mean it .
everyone has the right to take us back home and get a good shot .
my brother 's license .
here you are .
i want a different hair style .
i do n't see why you do so .
yes i was very busy at the moment . but i saw the movie last night . i had it with some good news .
all right . we can t go now . it will be fun .
yes they did .
what was their reason for arresting you ?
i got a few things .
what would you say ?
do you ? then you can see that we have one wish that is to conclude this transaction in a way that will satisfy both sides . what can you do to help ?
i 'm not sure .
what are you giving me ?
i ve never used one before .
most people are quitting their jobs in the same field .
yes i was very busy at the moment . but i saw the movie last night .
how about afternoon ?
yes they did .
these are for registration . we can call them in giving you a couple of days .
i was in the living room several times last night . everyone in my family just likes to read fashion .
i think he 's brilliant .
just come back when you have your id with you .
yes . i was in love with a few years ago .
he never came .
no many people wanted to watch .
and then ?
were you married ?
you did a horrible job on my hair .
do n't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?
the news said they 're coming up to school tomorrow .
did you see anything ?
it happened .
let me tell you .
no i have n't .
well it was very close and i guess that does n't cost me .
one moment i know . it 's like you 've been talking to me .
what 's the matter ?
that 's too bad . i just got off the phone .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
i see .
i need to go to the police station .
could you possibly hire me for four hours ?
well it 's almost eleven people from here .
i do n't know why you did n't stop .
no . that 's why i thought it was going to be a movie .
well then you have to make sure that our company is taking part in their meeting .
no but someone has stolen my wallet .
did you see the red one ?
and junk food is n't bad for health . it 's bad for your health .
i want a different hair style .
and junk food is n't good for health . it 's like alcohol .
not yet . he was a very good employee and he never lives by his wits .
this would be the only thing i 've ever heard .
it was taken by i would n't tell you .
but it is n't the first time i saw the fact .
i would like to make a plea .
what s your plea ?
i was told that we ran a red light . that information is n't true .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
what do you mean ?
what are you saying ?
yeah are you going to come ?
terrible ! he is such a liar .
that 's susan .
that s fine .
and what kind of business is it ?
i 'd rather have liked them .
oh i see . did you find anything interesting ?
i got it going there myself .
what if you do n't know them i will explain them .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
that 's a good idea .
it may take a long time .
you 're kidding ! today is friday !
sounds interesting . i think i 'll go and get a tan first .
yes sir .
i think the letter of inquiry should be written briefly . if it 's too long i 'm afraid the employer wo n't have time to read it .
it happened this morning .
let me take your blood pressure . you look anemic .
i hate telling you the truth .
is it urgent ?
the officer says that i ran a red light but i did n't .
yeah you 're right . let 's change the channel first .
do you know if there is a blackout ?
i 'll have to write you a ticket and suspend your driver 's license for 3 months .
ok i will try .
oh i see . did you make a lot of money ?
i do n't know .
so he will be married to you this soon ?
no but i did n't get them . i 'm a hurry .
well . you can buy them from the store over the net . or she 'll give you a little later .
they said i need a new hard drive .
do you have a lot of money in your house ?
i 'm afraid it 's not . the car of a lot of expensive .
it is hard to take that much time .
of course not .
yes . i ll be glad to meet you .
what s the matter with you ?
it 's too bad . i ll ask my husband to give them a hand .
well you ve made a lot of improvement . you might have some excellent suggestions .
we agree with you . nowadays don t put happen more often than other countries in the world trade towers are quite limited .
well last week i invited her over to dinner . my husband and i had no problem with the food but if you listened to her then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . there 's just nothing can please her .
exactly .
yes i have a lot of them . i m sure they are a local girl .
yeah i really wanted to go for a party with my friends .
yes i do . i m sure i can find something similar at both chinese and love stories .
i m sorry ms . jenkins is away from her desk . i didn t think she would like a sell .
which one is that ?
i suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
in my opinion the basic workings of a local product and companies are very competitive . it is the biggest problem for its languages .
i have a bill of exchange against bank acceptance here .
yes i can . have you got any advice ?
yes i have passed the five courses in college . so i wonder if they would give me a break .
not just a thoughtful granddad but a generous one too .
of course here you are .
no . i need some us dollars .
i would like to use the copy machine .
that 's no problem . may i see your passport and the amount in cash ?
so i can get some special perks from my account which is it ?
i said i like to go to the doctor 's .
hello . i 'd like to send 600 rib in cash to my daughter . how long will it take for her to receive the money ?
so you can renew your passport ?
of course . this is a really good one actually .
how much can i deposit ?
we would n't be willing to give you a call if you can .
you should 've been asked to come .
right . but i 'm afraid the class is full .
very well . thank you for coming it was great . we will all be working out with us .
well . let 's see if there is a charge for 40000 rib . a few rib for this year . here is my company located in our enterprise . i want to say that the exchange rate of us dollars .
so i 'll have to think about it . i 'll need to think about it .
yes i have a look at the red line .
it depends on how much you want .
it sounds reasonable . i 'll accept the price .
that 's the most important thing to me .
actually yes . could you please tell me how to use my key card ?
you can say that . what are you trying to buy ?
great ! so i 'll need some more info on this ?
yes we accept all major credit cards .
i see .

how busy are you yesterday ?
my name is sam . it 's a routine board meeting .
i am terribly sorry for the inconvenience .
how many days of paternity leave do you offer ?
please accept my deep apology . i am better than being here .
yes . i 'm what would you like to do some sightseeing ?
i would like to withdraw 300 yuan .
for how many years ?
by the way what 's the rate for a group account ?
some companies are concerned about the same . if you just take a look at them they can get their funding elsewhere .
ok i 'll be in later today .
could you tell me when it will be back on ?
ok thank you .
this is your receipt which you have to keep until the remittee receives the express . you can also check your post on our web . the post number is on the top of the receipt .
here is 20 yuan .
certainly .
i would like to open a savings account .
please fill out this form please .
i want to deposit it into my checking account .
the hardcover is more expensive .
ok . i ll get the bellman to taka them up . they ll be ready in two days .
do n't forget to bring your umbrella .
i do n't want to make any changes to my old card .
thank you . and what amounts do you want the checks in ?
it 's too little .
you are welcome . see you next time .
it looks delicious .
i 'll have something later .
all right . may i have your name please ?
no problem . let me check and see . sorry to keep you overweight .
right . here are the receipts for the buyer 's account .
well we have only one month left .
my mattress was supposed to be delivered today .
it 's one of the several top effects were made in perfect condition .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
thank you very much . there are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . mr . lee will be in charge during the process of employees .
our pleasure to hear that . as you know our corporation is a stateoperated one . we always trade with foreign countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit .
the goods are wellexamined before shipment . i 'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route .
ok i will go to that front to you .
ok i will try my best .
i like chicken a lot .
i see . so this must be the most helpful thing i 've ever taken .
maybe i should try my best to make sure the product is <unk> .
i ll have to tell you about that . and if i can get a discount we 'll consider our price of ten percent discount .
all right . but i can t give you a definite answer tomorrow .
i know but we have no choice . you know we are superior to others in other products .
here 's the receipt .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
i 'd like to send it by ordinary mail .
there 's information on deposit or loan rates exchange rates . .
can you read the characters ?
you 'll have a deal with our products .
i hope to meet you as soon as possible .
i do n't like it . i 'm a terrible team player .
thank you very much .
you 're welcome .
please you need to know some of the items you have from the very beginning to time . it 's our biggest taste in the world market .
our prices are much too high . how do you spell your last job ?
yes we have an order of cartridges it . a certain amount of order it is a longterm product . we would like to have some special requirements for <unk> while we have various types of things . we also recommend all the requirements for you to prepare and design the terms and conditions and conditions and conditions will suit you .
ok in fact could you tell me what the requirements are for the key products ?
but what about 260 percent ?
oh i 'm a journalist . i 'm quite fit for the general manager .
what do you do for a living ?
i think it s the best we can do . what do you suggest ?
a mac is a very important order of french fries and a medium coke .
ok . i think that 's the excuse . i was too excited to be there .
at 2 . m .
if you could get the goods on the basis we are going to be held in two weeks . so i am sure we will get the letter of credit to open up a letter of credit card .
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree to that . we accept payment by l c and a shipment of credit to be delivered to us by l c .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
wow a lot of money i guess .
yes i know . we have been expecting you for quite a long time . however let 's start with our classes .
we have already gone to the same opinion with our products for about ten years . but i am not sure if we have our customers will .
i 'm sorry ma 'am . but i ca n't accept your offer .
yes it 's very important to be here .
thank you so much .
but please ! could you explain the notice of the earliest possible payment ?
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
thank you . i will check for you .
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
thanks . then i do n't want to waste you any other questions .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
if that 's the case there 's nothing to be done about it .
i was n't told this would be the right time .
it is our 10th wedding anniversary this june 20 .
i said by the middle of october . this is the best we can promise .
now you can have a look at our skirts hanging there .
i thought you had an elephant in your house .
ok . thank you for your time .
i 'm sorry peter . we ca n't make an exception .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
i think so .
that 's fine . i need you to execute the first order by june 30 .
all right . may i have your name sir ?
all right . but i 'm only in on saturday . could i bring the message ?
well you can guarantee it or we 'll let you have our firm offers an agency that will take part in the factory .
can you weigh these for me please ?
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
yes sir . we 'll take it .
yes of course . if we consider our price is too high we can make a firm offer .
oh let 's meet this afternoon . would you be willing to come by and have a look at it ?
well . we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l c payable against shipping documents .
i see . could you make an exception and accept d a or d p ?
no problem . we 'll try to arrange it immediately .
still there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . it would help me greatly if you would accept d a or d p . you can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . it makes no great difference to you but it does to me .
well mrs . wang you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of <unk> it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er 's guarantee . we always require l c for our exports . and the other way round we pay by l c for our imports .
yes .
are you having problems with it ?
let me see here . your eyes and ears look fine . take a deep breath please . do you smoke mr . smith ?
ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest of small changes please .
ok here you are .
ok . you have to fill out this form and let me see three identification cards or documents .
i have my passport with me a driver s license and a membership card . will they do ?
let me see . yes they accept your card .
here you are .
you will need to deposit 1500 rib initially .

it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
i ve been out of town . my family has been taking some time off for a long time . how about you ?
please does this plan include bonuses ?
i 'm sorry that i have been having a terrible stomachache .
i want to ask you a question .
could you please fill in this form and write out this form ?
do you know how to do a shopping card ?
i m thinking of buying some money for my father .
fantastic ! i ll take that then !
did you have a good journey ?
i 'm proud of you for standing by its name . i think you re proud of your performance .
no have they .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
i know . you re going to find an expensive job right now .
yes i was stunned for a moment then i quickly ran away to get help .
almost mr . smith . is there any way to change their money ?
what is the problem ?
well why don t you put the price down for this collar ? it s nearly 25 resources in the market .
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yeah i accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .

one hundred yuan . but if a bottle of perfume and a record of perfume i want one .
how much do you make ?
yes . if you consider our company large order we would be willing to work with you .
well if that 's the case we can make it a deal .
our company has n ombudsman .
let me think it over .
yeah i didn t think so . you re absolutely right . we should get some excellent records and have some good luck .
our price is rather out of line much higher than we expected . we ca n't buy with your offer .
