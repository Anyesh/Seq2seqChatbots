i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
you can eat as much as you 'd like to eat here but they are much more expensive .
i know . but chocolate cake is better for me .
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda .
have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
i do n't have any medicine at all . i do n't have a wellbalanced diet .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size than i am now !

i want to buy a pair of shoes .
what kind of flowers do you like ?
it is the best season for a picnic . it is impossible to get to a dinner party .
that s the reason . don t you say that next time ?
i don t think i m looking at ordering oysters in your specials . you know what i m going to buy a dozen .
well i m sure we should spend a few more money in this country . there s a practically no oven in the country . there s a garden in the world .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need a lot of money .
let s just sit down . . . quick ! i can t stand that woman s finally !
i said i was in the car accident .
get out of my store you jerk .
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged by your programs . you can use the computer and send your email to your expense account .
what s wrong with my computer ?
i mean it is not my fault . it s the truth . i m calling to hear that it is how it is .
great ! how much will i have to pay ?
well it 's free of charge . but it 's for your use .
i don t want to be ripped like you . i want to hear that and professional skills .
i don t understand why you are always so slow . i just wasn t online and talk to the boss . it was the truth .
i see . ok then let s look at the problem . i think we ll need to get all the groceries for new ones .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about the new amount that you ve been keeping it all up ?
no not that much . just cut it out . do n't be too complicated . you have to cut out the pepper or we 'll get it .
cool ! then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no . you will have to put it on your storage space .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
i 'm really sorry . i thought you had an article . . .
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again . now i need to write it all over the time .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'm going to jingshan park . originally it was an imperial garden while it is now a public park .
i think you 'll like it .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but i do n't want to waste any weight .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i know i could handle that . you could n't spare time . it 's the same .
oh i know . i know ! let me just get it out of the store .
i think i will try to find the perfect house .
you 'll get used to it . i knew you were n't going to be late for dinner .
that sounds great . give me a chance .
i know . i have to prepare for the next test but i do n't know what to do .
oh i see . i will arrange for you to take a look at the class . you see i have a class right there .
about fourteen .
so it 's hard to believe that people can spend as much time in america .
i hope so .
i 'd like to open a new account .
do you have a particular idea of getting ?
i want to be able to look at the download information on the internet . it can be frustrating when i get a computer and use the internet .
well i can give you a special package that would be possible . you already have a specific program so you can use your computer to download . it 's for broadband wireless internet with a download speed of several other options that provides electricity for free .
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
you have to buy your ticket first .
awesome ! how can i do that ?
yes i did .
i know ! it s better to get to the bottom of my car !
don t worry . it s a bit chilly in here . can you put a deposit ?
i am glad that it did n't have any sense of bad weather . i can t wait to see it . it s like the white house .
good news ! you ve done a lot of work on it .
it sure is .
that dress looks great but it 's too plain .
i don t like the color .
no i m thinking about buying this sweater . i don t know what it s going to be perfect !
i like the color . it s so nice of you to try it on .
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while . i prefer a black jacket .
what color do you like ?
i like the jeans but i don t have any new year s resolution .
don t worry . i ll just have a look . i m sorry . you can t take it .
thanks . i m sorry to hear that .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
oh i know . i can go and get a look at the store .
i think so .
is it very cold in winter ?
you 're right . the bathroom is so quiet and peaceful . i 'll go and try it .
it s a great idea to have a natural home .
you are right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small .
i d like to have a try .
i have n't thought of that .
oh yes . i remember there is a fridge and a garden .
i m glad to hear that .
it does n't cost anything .
that s way too much .
how much are you willing to pay ?
i ll just have to wait for ucla .
that 'll be 4 . 25 cents .
i can t believe it .
that s not a problem .
i won t know anything about it .
i m afraid not .
yes i do . i like cooking best .
i don t like it . it s too noisy . i can t stand it anymore . it s too noisy . i can t stand it .
i ll put all the plates and cutlery away as i dry them . where is the tea towel ? oh here it is .
i know i know . but it is hard to make a new call to us . i am willing to make it a special dinner .
i like indian food as well . i usually only eat less than coffee . i can get some chinese food from chinese food .
i ve heard that this one is good for you to learn french . it s sure to be healthy .
i only buy lunch at the cafeteria .
yeah it 's really amazing . i can get some chinese food for my collection . it 's hard to have a try .
about one hundred and thirty minutes .
very good . do you want one ?
i would like to have a look at the five dolls .
oh i see . i will take the one .
i think you can buy this dress . it 's the same color .
i m sure you ll find out better than that .
you re welcome . i have no idea how you are .
that s right . i think i should also get some old clothes too . and i can t get any of them .
i think they 're the same . what 's the price of this skirt ?
what size do you want ?
i would like to have a casual style .
thank you . i think i m going to have to look at the air .
thanks .
this is he . what can i do for you ?
i 'm mr . stephen . i 'm here to see if i can find a job .
that 's a good idea .
i am not sure .
i m happy to hear that .
ok . i 'll be expecting you .
ok . i 'll be expecting you at 1130 . see you then .
no not really . i 've got to go .
do n't mention it .
ok . . . here you are .
no but if you can bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ?
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
oh i see . i 'll take the room .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
you can pick one up or you can get one free drink .
i ll just sit there and look at the kitchen next .
you can always find an apartment in the ads .
i could n't agree with you more .
what a nice shade of the sky is built .
i think i ll look in the kitchen next .
you can t see the sign of the building .
i am sure it will .
oh four . we have a dog and a cat .
well you could probably get it yourself . i could n't stand it any more .
i think it s a nice idea to pamper yourself occasionally .
i think it s a bit expensive .
i know what you mean . i can t know how to use it .
it 's a bit strange . i can go to the post office to see what it 's like .
i love the beautiful lawn . can you tell me where the can find the garden ?
i love this place .
thank you .
it s a ruby . it s original .
this is mary speaking .
hello mr . clark . i m calling to confirm our meeting tomorrow .
oh really ? where are you going to live ?
i can think of it .
let 's say about 600 ?
no i 'm afraid not . i 'm in a bit of a hurry .
i am really sorry .
that 's fine .
what ?
i 'm finished . here 's my card .
no but if you can bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ?
yes . i 'd like to buy a skirt .
i see . you have a return ticket .
that 's a good idea . i 'll go to a try .
well you have to pay tax for this position . it 's just a good unit .
is that a lot ?
yes it 's a popular dish among young ladies .
i am going to go to the student office .
that 's good .
well i have no idea what you are talking about .
yes . that s a good idea .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon . when will you use it ?
yes it 's one of the best known in this company . our school has a general concept that is much better than the others .
well i 'll have to think about it .
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple .
i know . i want to try some day . but i 'm not sure federal express picks up mail in this city .
i 'm sorry but i do n't know what you want to do . you can talk to our class in the class .
well i can only use a computer . i can listen to the computer and get some information about that .
i m just curious . i m just going to have to look at the safety story .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon . when will you use it ?
that 's a good idea . you know there are many students in america that can train them . and it 's easy for them to study .
yes i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
i see . you have to prepare for your class .
i see . i 'd like to try some day . you could bring me some free souvenirs .
i think you should ask your advice .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you are welcome .
oh i see . do you want a shampoo ?
no i do n't . i 'm staying in bed for three days .
i 'm going to get a airport for my family .
i want an ordinary one .
what about your hair ?
i do n't want to . i 'm afraid we do n't have to wait till the end of the week .
i see . do you want me to cut you a few tests ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't afford it . i do n't think i 'll take the shirt .
well i would like to help you with that .
no you do n't . you will really need to drink a lot of water .
you are booked on american airlines .
yes i do . it 's hard to find one .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon . when will you use it ?
i think you 're right . everything will be fine .
i see . you have done a lot of reading exercises in your country .
i think you 're right .
i think you 'll love this .
oh i see . thank you .
yes we do .
you can have a try .
i see . you 've done a lot of great job .
i know what you mean .
oh well . i know that 's the nearest one . call me and tell me the local <unk> <unk> <unk> .
what have you been doing ?
where is the new house ?
i really want to buy a new house for the summer too .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
i can also get a special carpet for my needs .
it sure did . we also have a nice evening and a lot of room too .
i do n't know .
where is it ?
how long until you have a nice house ?
that is a great idea . i can also get a new one for you .
it s also a good idea to have more money to buy one but still the bathroom would be more expensive .
it 's on the fourth floor .
maybe you should have a try .
i have to get a little exercise . i do n't know what to do .
where is it ?
it 's easy . it 's about the complicated . you just have to follow the instructions .
that 's true . if we go to the museum museum guide you can take a bus there .
i can t stand it . let me just check . . .
i am not . i have n't decided yet .
what are you going to eat ?
i prefer sea food .
yes . i like chinese food .
yes i do .
i think you 'll love it .
i like the fish .
right now we have a question for you . for your need of photo . we can go to your restaurant and see what they have like in their house .
well i ve always been doing business on a diet .
what do you think of some doing that ?
thank you . i 'll try to use some kind of rules .
i see . do you have anything to eat ?
that 's a good idea . i 'll bring a bottle of wine .
you are right . chinese food is really delicious . i have never had indian food so i would n't mind giving you so much trouble .
we have a great variety of options . what about you want to buy a car online ?
we have lots of things . the most important thing is n't it ?
i see . i will find the new sweater and this is so expensive . i will have to get rid of it .
i know . but what can we do ? i know it 's just a girl .
i m sorry . you can t take it .
oh i see . what is their extension ?
you are welcome .
no . i think it will be a great help .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
it 's a hard question . but i am afraid it will be too expensive to make a <unk> .
i am sure i will .
what time do you begin ?
these are the things that are from an major stories of about the domestic market .
i was hoping to get a few new apartment right away .
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
i think i will try to buy some now .
yes . i think i could ask around to see if anyone 's got a room available .
do you have a trainer to help you do the actual shopping ?
well we use the exhaust gases from our printing <unk> to provide energy to heat our dryers .
i see . if i were the workers i would n't have the money to buy the price .
i was joking .
good i 'm sure you 'll love it . i 'd like to know what you 're going to do .
the fee is 500 .
i do n't think so . i think the idea of living here is better .
i can get that for you .
yes . i 'd like to buy a vcr .
may i have your name please ?
here you are .
i see . i 'll have to get it for you right away .
i 'm not sure . i just want to try it .
i 'll just buy some .
oh i see . i 'll take the compact and the other one .
i 'd like to book a ticket for this one .
well i 'll have to get a pair for you .
well i think i can get more and more free stuff .
well i guess i can fix the price .
i 'm afraid not . i ca n't stand a big problem with computers . we are always willing to help them with the customers of our clients . we are always willing to help them with them .
i can tell you what happened .
i 'm afraid that 's impossible . you see i 'm confident of doing such a good job . i ca n't help .
here you are .
thank you .
i see . here you are .
i 'm sure you 'll enjoy yourselves .
sure . what do you want to know ?
i 'm a nurse .
do i have to work now ?
could you wait a few minutes ?
anything else ?
have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?
i do n't think so . but the chinese think it 's really cheap for us to give them more advice .
you said it . we could get a really bad bite to eat and catch a movie .
let me have a look . whoa ! this tea towel s a little ragged . do you have another one ?
what ? you are the chicken !
i thought the romans do what everyone else does .
i feel much better . thank you .
i did n't know that . i was n't thinking of them . i was waiting for my advice .
no i can t . i 'm afraid i ca n't .
yes i do . i like cooking very much .
that 's exactly what i was thinking of ! i m really sorry !
once a week .
yeah you are right . i ll start drinking and having dinner with meals that are high in fat . i m sure you ll have a stronger cough or caffeine .
i know . i 've got to get a parttime job too . i 'll go to the bank for my home .
that s a good idea . you should try to find something you like . classical music is more serious and healthy . you might find something you like to eat too .
well i always cook a lot of big meals .
you are right . everything is probably going to be a little dry . the baby is very fresh and we have had a great time .
i think most people do .
do you know what we eat ?
i like the food . it s delicious .
yes . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making thai food . i m pretty good at making thai food .
i like the fish .

no thanks . i 'll have that and get you some cereal .
you are a good citizen .
i 've got a few pounds of chicken and a soda .
what kind of drink do you have ?
i do n't know exactly what to choose .
of course . we also include water sugar and caffeine .
no . that 's a good idea .
you 'll get a bowl of sugar with ice cream . they will be ready if you 'd like .
you are right . swimming can be used for people .
yes they are . i can see them .
ok . i 'll just have a try .
that would be great !
not really . i have to get a lot of work .
i know but i am really in a hurry . i was told the boss was really delicious .
that sounds great . i 'll bring a bottle of that .
i know . i 'm a great cook .
that sounds really good .
i think i can try some more .
yeah . i ve already been cooking so much . i ve been going to the club regularly . the training is very good . i mean how to cook it is .
i bought all the ingredients for the children . it is so beautiful .
i hope you can make it .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
ok . i can eat the vegetables . and i love them .
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that 's a special coconut ginger chicken with rice ball .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that .
white rice please .

i 'll pick you up at 600 .
i 'd like to have a glass of juice .
what kind of soda would you like ?
i see .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
i 'll have a diet and a bad headache .
i 'll have beer please .
i do n't like this kind of thing .
i am sorry sir . we will check your room availability and see if you 'd like .

then what about in my wallet ?
well you 'd better take an umbrella . it 's a kind of a sport of a sport to work out .
what 's it about ?
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
well it 's hard to believe in the government . so the americans must have been experiencing a lot of money .
really .
how do they handle the quality ?
i do n't think so . the thing is that the people are capable of giving them too .
i 've heard about that . let 's see . . . . my cousin has a way around the corner . that 's easy !

i can read it . i can only hear it .

you 're right . i just wish i had a little trouble with my boss .
well do n't worry about that . the teachers will help you at school . they do n't have much time to do with your homework .
i m very sorry .
yes . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to forget .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem .

it 's usually windy with some colleagues .
very interesting . so it seems very relaxed .
yes .
what size are you ?
i think it 's worth trying .
it 's hard to say . but you know it 's hard for a graduate to do things and make sure that you are on your own .
you should have more rest then .

i know . i think it 's time for me to stop and get away from the city that is n't as bad as christmas .
i m afraid i can t .

i 'm very sorry to hear that .
i do n't want to .
i know . i know it 's not so hard for you to quit .
yes it 's so popular that we have .
no . they are just opera costumes . do you know much about them ?
i know . i know !
i ca n't believe it .
they sure did .
oh i see . i have to go to the restroom so i can watch it .
they were all sitting in the living room . they had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house . if you ca n't find someone else they had all been killed .
yes that s what i asked for .

he must be very easygoing .
he 's a very famous teacher .

i think you should call him and tell him i think he better go to his office .
i 'm sorry .
he 's checking bags .
he 's a hero .

i do n't have the slightest idea .
i m not going to tell her that i want you to be nice and forget to give her some tips .
i 'd love to .
how about this one ?

it 's the powell orchestra .

they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
i can but i ca n't stand the computer here .
what 's it about ?
well standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . express is the fastest but it 's also the most expensive . it only takes three days and you can track your package online .
what 's the tv for ?

he 's got dark hair and brown eyes .
i do n't understand .

i will try my best .

i would like to make that .
it 's the truth .
well you are visiting someone else and you are visiting her .
i 'm doing great . how about you ?
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've got a date already .

that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure . i love it .
i think you 'd better have a look at the menu .
no but i would n't be surprised if it rained tomorrow .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
yes it 's really cold .
i do n't know . i do n't like this weather . it 's too cold and i do n't want to get it .
you are right . this sure is what we 've done . i think it 's much like this .
it looks nice . and how much is it ?
okay . let 's go and see what happened .
i do n't think so . i think it will be too late .
let 's just hope it stays warm .
we have a lot of options about our home because we have everything on our own .
what are you going to do ?
whatever . can i have asking for dessert ?
she is .
you are kidding .
tom that lucky guy .
he is fine . he retired last week . it s turning point in his life . now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .
i see . he must have been having an easy time .
he is all right .
i hope she ll enjoy her visit .
he 's been talking to my son .
but you really ca n't do any good .
well control is really using common sense when you plan to quit smoking .
i do n't know . he 's always absentminded in the class .
i know that . i mean that i 've got to get used to it .
you are suspected of hiding illegal drugs . so what are you trying to do ?
i like to play table tennis better .
you are so lucky .
you are right . she s got married and now she s my brother .
i do n't think so . maybe it 's just a little bit of it .
i would n't do it if i were you .
i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to forget .
i 'll go and get a hamburger and a german family .
i 'm not surprised . i do n't know what to do .
how about going to a concert ?
i 'm still not .
ok . see you tomorrow .
i know i am . i just don t feel sad about them .
i was running around the track at my apartment and there was no other reason .
thanks for all your help .
you are in the other direction .
you re in the wrong direction .
that s what happened .
yes . and you 're done .
ok . . .
i know . i did n't know .
oh she is so young .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
what 's the price of the store ?
i 'm not feeling well . i 'm just worried about my work .
i 'm sorry .
thank you .
yes he does . he loves football .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
nothing much . i 'm just putting on my knowledge to the new environment .
how often do you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
he said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
i see .
i m in pretty bad shape . i ve got to go to the airport and see what i can do .
what does his dad say ?
he is a captain .
i do n't know .
i know . i could n't stand the heat .
i 'll beat him .
i 'm so sorry .
he said i 'm a very good neighbour .
he is more nice than wise .
he would have the perfect chance to have a job like that .
i think he 's going to be an instruction star .
how can you be so sure ?
well i 've asked for a few times . i am a stranger here . and i am a stranger here .
i think he can do it .
no i do n't think so . we have n't been married for a long time .
i know i know . but it 's hard to get used to such a child .
i think you should have a house that is kind of you .
i agree . he is good at backstroke and free style .
oh really ?
what happened ?
thank you .
i know a good restaurant . it 's a pity that we can speak english in english .
because everyone wants to talk to them about it .
oh dear . i guess your passport will be ready in a few minutes .
no i 'm afraid not . i 'm just studying something .
don t worry . it s probably of the stress you ve been under . just take some aspirin . combined with the stronger cough medicine it will make you feel very tired . you shouldn t work or use any equipment which requires concentration . here s your prescription . after this is your prescription . please tell me your prescription .
did you need something ?
i left feeling pretty confident about my score .
oh that 's really cool . but you have to promise me that you will get it .
i was really sick .
maybe you are right . but i still think it 's time for us to relax .
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k ?
she 's probably going to be busy this weekend . she 's going to move this saturday .
but they may have some difficulty in doing it .
maybe you are right .
what do you mean ?
i 'm sorry . i thought you knew .
you should have told me you were in love with her .
i tried .
you did n't see the red light ?
i 'm sorry .
i 'm sorry .
i m sorry .
i 'm glad you like it .
i 'll try it . i 'm sure it 'll be all right .

i will try to be busy but it will just be fun .
it must be kate .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball for years .
i do n't think so . he does n't treat things like that .
i don t think i m at the moment .
i hear you are really a henpecked husband .
i think i do . the kind of skin is kind of oily .
you should consider listening to the rule of yourself and make up your mind first .
i am a nurse at the moment . i need a little space on it .
i 'm sure you will like her .
no i do n't .
nice to meet you too .
i m not looking for it .

i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
i m sorry .
i think you 'll love this .
she is expecting .
what about birth certificate ?
well . you can have a try .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
i m glad we did .
yes i would .
at 7 am .
i 'll be there in about half an hour .
no . that 's all . thanks .
sure that would be great . i will take a picture of the house for my friend .

what happened ?
you are such a wimp ! you have to take the blood of them .
what 's the matter ?
i was in the living room .
take it easy .
what 's the matter with them ?
i think that advertising is going to be more important than the world .
i know . i know there are so many people here .
my husband is an american . he criticizes me when i do that . he says that i can t change a child s behavior by using force . he is learning what i am doing now .
you mean your friend 's brother ?
yes he did .
well they may have some time for you .
well . . . .
i think we should have . it s faster than taking the subway .
she 's going to be a great mother .
i feel they 're dirty .
i think you re absolutely right .
well i don t know . but i m not so sure .
oh i m sorry . i can t .
i have to get a little exercise . i do n't know what to do .

yes . i 'd like to send this parcel to shanghai .
yes .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon . when will you use it ?
how do you do ?
nice to meet you too .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i think you 'll find that there is a problem with the quality .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
and that s it .
it 's just what i want .
it 's a small world . i 'll be glad to help you .
i ll drink to that .
you are welcome .
i 'm glad you say so .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea .
i know . it was a great time to see how you feel .
i do n't know .
why not ?
great idea . i like hanging out in bars at night .
well then may i invite you for the party ?
that 's great . i 'll bring a bottle of wine .
well there s a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes . shall we go tomorrow ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
i do n't have any hobbies .
ok . let 's go .
ok . i 'll call you saturday morning .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon . when will you use it tonight ?
i 'm sorry but i think it 's my fault .
it must be interesting to live in a coffee bar and tea . let me give you a bath .
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
i 've got a sore throat and my chest hurts .
you 'll soon get used to it .
yes .
you are a real friend in need .
it was n't always like this you know .
i do n't believe it .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
you re right .
yes i know . i 'm really sorry .
i 'd better take a taxi .
i think i 'll have a warm day .
that 's great . what 's on tonight ?
it was just robbed .
you didn t have to buy a lot of stuff . i guess you d have to buy a new car .
yes . may i help you ?
i am calling to let you know that you are selected to fill the position of project manager .

i ca n't believe it .
that s a good idea . you can have a try .
i just went to the store and i m having a dinner party .
thanks .
yes i am . i have been working for a long time .
you 're being kind of but i think you should n't have a pet that can do .
i see . you have to pay more than 200 bills for all the employees in your living room .
i m fine .
no . you do n't have to wear it .
do people in south america get along with others ?
i do n't think we 'll need to . we need to get some things done .
i see . what about the commission ?
we charge to your credit card .
i think that a good idea .
it 's possible .
i m not sure yet . i m not sure yet .
oh really ? how is it ?
yes i 've been here for about two years .
i could but i m not sure if i will be a better job .
oh i know . i know i 'm a good student too . i 've got to go .
they 're ok .
i 'm not exactly sure but it 's a problem . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun to be a lot of fun .
i think you should try to have more money . you can go to the office to have more time to buy some new plan .
i know i know . i figure as long as you do n't have any money to live on . i do n't know how to live without a job .
i do n't know . they 're big . what do you think ?
what about my brother ?
they did n't have a choice of opinion . i 'll get it done quickly .
that sounds great . i 'm so happy for you .
it 's true . it seems we have been looking for a while now .
sounds interesting !
what is it ?
i see . i think i should get more casual in new york . i think i should have a new dress in white .
i 'm so surprised b . why do n't you ask her for a date ?
well . i guess i was born and raised here . i think i 've got to go .
i know . i 'm the only one who never blogs . when can i get a job ?
what is your date of birth ?
he is fine with himself . he said he would be a lot of pressure from home .
oh i see . i m sure you will like it .
that s what is surprising . i bet he is a <unk> man with a girl .
i know . i know it s a pity because we have children here . but bob we don t know many people in your country .
well this is the best we can do . this is because we have to stay in the country for a long time .
that s quite right .
i used to work as a teacher .
so you 're chinese to buy i 'm from taiwan .
ha ! ha ! that sounds like a good idea .
you re doing a very good job .
she asked me to stay in bed and eat foreign food .
i hope to get to talk with you soon .
how about your family ?
do they have to do that ?
i think you should apply to the language . you can speak english fluently .
i ve been out of town . i really wanted to go out with you .
that s great . would you like to go with me ?
i went to the seafood restaurant . i love road trips . i love road all the time .

do you exercise ?
i m sure they ll enjoy the life of bees .
well i m not good at it anymore . i don t want to spend it any time with money on me . i m afraid i just want to learn something more .
did you have to take a medical before you could take out the police ?
you need to get off at the next stop and stop .
you know i think we should go out the river . it s a good idea to go around the world .
i 'll go myself then .
well i just have to take up the locks and iron bars and iron .
what s the problem ?
yes i did . i went to school today .
you know i like pop music very much .
right .
ok . let 's go !
you are watching football .
what kind of sport do you like to play ?
i know . i can play it well .
you are quite right . many people like tennis and i play it regularly .
it depends .
i guess i could but i 'm not a big fan of tv .
i see . do you think a regular problem ?
i do n't know . i just do n't know . i never know whether i can do that . but i used to be a group of classic in our country .
i know i know i know . but i m not in the mood for my own . it s just that i know i can do it .
yeah . we have a lot of time .
i 'm a teacher .
get on your own . i can t wait to see your parents for you and i know how you feel .
i know . i have been looking for a while now . i just have to go to the library for a while .
that s true . for me it s hard to find a job like mine .
in that case i won t get any unemployment .
of course . you can have a try .
well i used to be like that but now i m in a hurry . it s not like i can do it by myself .
that 's great . i do n't know why i can just listen to the gym . i just want to hear the good .
you are very modest .
yes it is . we 've been through all day . we had a lot of fun there .
i am really excited .
i 'm not sure . i think i 'm making a big mistake .
i 'm just zina the boss . you 're the boss .
they 're for the most fun .
i 'm not looking for this job .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
i 'm not sure what you 're talking about . i 've been waiting for a while and there 's only a few days now .
i 'll call you later then .
i 'm sorry . i know you were in love with webtracker people .
well maybe i should have a try . i can get some more exercise .
did you get a copy of your income from him ?
not bad . how about you ? have n't seen you for a long time .
sorry they 've already gone through the board .
i guess you did n't know that . and i got laid off .
and not that bad .
i don t know .
i know .
oh i see . thank you .
i 'll pick you up at six thirty .
it s saturday a great weekend .
what time will the wedding begin ?
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s an anniversary of our weeding .
he said he would be a good career path to see the old age .
i know he is really a hard worker .
i know i know . i ca n't believe it . i 'm sure if you would live with it .
i know . i am going to look at it this afternoon and i think i will go back to my office at the airport .
you 're right . but you know i 've been looking for a job as a manager .
he had to make a change .
what 's wrong with him ?
that 's right . maybe you should go to the office to pick up some up .
it was a real red letter .
oh i see .
how come ?
i got it from an <unk> .
how long will it take to get back to me ?
oh i see . i will try my best to be a successful man . but how can i do that ?
i see .
ok . i 'll wait .
i 'm sure you 'll love it .
come on ! in the two hours we 've been here you have n't sung even one song !
what did he have in mind ?
oh shut up !
i know . i never thought about that . i do n't have any money to waste . i think it 's time to waste .
you have to be joking .
oh i see . i will tell her .
i know . it was a kind of strange movie . i can understand why it was so popular .
i know . but i do n't know why chinese is the greatest chinese culture .
you are so thoughtful .
i 'm sorry i did n't know that . but i do n't know how to play it .
what s the matter ?
not bad .
what 's the matter ?
i just lost track of time . i was told by the bus that i 'd stop .
i know . but he always tells the chinese people to increase his cost .
yes he was . he said i 'm his dream girl .
and he 's so <unk> to like to <unk> at least .
i 'm not sure .
oh i see .
yes .
i know . i can do that .
i know .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . please do n't hurry .
he 'll be driving a car in the car . he 's got a car here . he 'll get it from the car park in the car . he can get it done on the baker account .
yes it is . and it also takes a while to find a good idea to relax .
the hours are from 9 o 'clock to 1
yes .
do you have to pay extra charge for the whole department ?
yes it is really hard to find a job that is more lively than keeping my experience . employees can be flexible . the only thing i need to learn a lot from my own .
yes . i do n't know how to use the internet .
i see .
i know . they are not so noisy that i ca n't bear to <unk> .
sure . we have great variety of options all kinds of tours in our city .
good idea . i 'll get some too .
we could try to lower our price by ten percent . if you want we can get a free tube of toothpaste and a few things .
yeah . you must have been busy lately .
i know . i 'm just doing it and i just have to go to class .
yes . that 's what i want .
i know . i 'm always busy with work .
you are a lucky man .
and i think i 'll go to the doctor .
he 's coming to the medical department .
here 's your card . please get a mug shot in the next room .
yes .
i know that . but i do n't think he 's that strongminded .
yeah .
that 's so nice of you .
no . the large one .
i see . thank you .
you are welcome .
nice to meet you i 'm jim taylor .
yes . you 're very right .
would you like to have lunch with me ?
good morning mr . green .
great . i 'll invite my sister to take care of the gift .
you are welcome .
ok . i 'll call the customer service office . when can i get it ?
i know . this is a pity . i can help you in the future .
what are the most fundamental concepts underlying the program ?
yes . there 's one on the corner of the street .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
i 'm sure you 'll love them .
i 'll come tomorrow then .
what are you <unk> ?
i see . i think i can have the experience as a guide to develop their employees as they are used to .
you are a good cook .
i see . i 'd like to go to the garden hotel .
i 'd really like to go with it . . .
i see . but you know it 's hard for me to find a way to learn . i think it 's just a good way to learn .
i can catch it .
that 's great . i can see you 're a big family .
you 're not going to be late for school today .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping around like that .
thank you . i 'm very glad to meet you .
you 're welcome .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes i do . i think i can learn it now .
there are a few stories of the great wall in the world . i like to see the <unk> . it 's worth visiting .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
oh no . it 's a long time to visit chinese .
oh i see .
oh yes . chinese tea represents another facet of popular culture . while a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft elegant music a teahouse is often a noisy crowded public space . people visit tea
not really . i like watching .
i do n't really like the news . i like the news a lot from the movies that i 'm a member of a gym to watch .
you are right . it 's not just that it 's not an eye .
what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
the olympic games of course is located in southern california . it is the biggest city in china .
i see . it 's also a pity that i missed the character .
i like baseball .
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't know that . i thought they were just once .
i know what you mean . he always looks very lonely .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
that 's right .
it 's a monthly magazine but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly .
is there anything interesting ?
sure . there are many pictures of <unk> from all over the world . they are a total of three hundred and fifty yuan .
i think so . i think it 's too noisy to see what 's in restaurants .
well there 's actually a documentary on the tv and a lot of tv . it 's bigger than a movie .
what about restaurants and entertainment ?
it 's hard to say . it depends on the user but the amount of the telephone and telephone number of the information you should do is relax .
i got it . i did n't pay attention to the sale of the machine .
we have to figure out what the prices are .
a friend of mine works !
you are right . it 's so romantic .
because i feel tired all the time even when i wake up in the morning . i find very difficult to do any work . i have no idea how to do it .
how about the tennis racket ?
i know . but in fact it 's not so much of a waste of money .
ok . let me make a wish . . . .
i 'll pick you up at six thirty .
i 'd like to try it .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
this is basically a few ahead of people . because we are in the perfect condition and he is not very good at swimming .
no there s no reason to ask a few people to turn off the tv .
it s a good idea to watch ally mcneal . go to the game to watch the ball to have a cup of tea and see the <unk> afterwards .
in my country there is no meaning in people .
you are absolutely right . the only tax for people will never be the smart .
no . there are only some kind of people who are already ill at the moment .
i also admire him for his courage and i really do n't know how to deal with it .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
i can t often forget to watch something else .
you are right . i just hope she ll get used to it .
what s the matter ?
what 's wrong with her ?
it seems you two have been like a cleaning . how 's it going to be like this ?
i was pretty hungry too .
i ll get them ready in about half an hour .
oh i see . well i think i 'll have a beer and my stuff . . .
well i ll have to wait you there . i ll call the police immediately and see if you can check . have you been doing anything tonight ?
no .
i ll remember that .
no i did n't . i 'm a little sick .
it s completely too good . if you want to find something that you like .
well i think it 's a little too far from the city . i 'd prefer to go to the great wall then .
i think that we should discourage people from people . people will try to find jobs to increase their jobs .
maybe so . but a law banning cigarettes would do no good .
i 'll just give you a ticket .
i agree . i think the government should do more to discourage people from smoking .
well you should have more money then . you can get a herald as soon as you can .
the biggest problem in my country is that the world is a very good place for our country . it s not always a large apartment .
that s why i listen to it in the evenings . i can t stand it anymore .
no i did n't .
i see . you do n't have to tell me that .
no problem . i ll get you to that right away .
well i still can still remember .
what happened ?
what is that ?
yes it is . but it 's the worst one i 've ever taken .
he ll be right . what are the shoes ?
it 's a small town but it 's not very big . it 's just over there .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
well most of them did .
what kinds of city are there ?
yes it did .
what was the biggest thing in your country ?
yes . several of them are the independent family and the other is a little bit larger .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
it s hard to say . it depends .
that 's a good game .
it s hard to say . it depends .
but that s the problem .
they are hard to work with people .
that sounds crazy ! but what is it that ?
there s a game on tonight . you can watch them .
i can play with the computer and play it well .
of course i can .
what ? you re just a real <unk> ! come on !
there are 5000 rolls in total .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
have you been under a lot of stress lately ?
i ve got a terrible headache . i think i ve got a cold and i feel dizzy and energetic . i ve got to get up and drink plenty of water and <unk> .
that s no problem . let me see . . . you still have ten days annual leave left is that right ?
i work hard so i m not sure .
have you been under a lot of pressure ?
yes i ve been thinking about that . i ve make an appointment with mr . green .
would you like to leave a message ?
i d love to . there s a movie called summer in ancient china . it won t be too hot for them .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . i can see that they are just <unk> for the type of books .
i think you should realize that the most conservative style changes .
i think so . all the top brands such as mcdonald 's and kfc are from america .
you are right . it 's the very beginning of each year .
actually i was n't too impressed by the chinese film . i like the subject of the art . i like the way that they are great .
it 's nice but i am not a big fan of tv shows .
yes . i ve read them about him . i m thinking about buying his new album .
how come ?
he s an english teacher . he only had a box of his pictures . he works too .
i agree . i m going to find a good movie . i m sure you ll like it .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week .
are you a member of his fan club ?
yes i was . i like gardening .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
yes . i bought two copies of all of them in the notebook .
you should have completely brought many copies .
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i think that they must have people being used to go to that new year .
people in show biz can have such an easy life i do n't know why they have to make it so complicated .
maybe they should have more money . they want publicity for themselves .
i think most of the people in show biz can have such an easy life i do . they have a need of dollars so they need it to make sure that they don t have enough money to buy it in their own country .
i don t think you can find all the way around the world . i m sure that one will win the type of camera . i don t want to buy any of my money .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to charity to help people who have the money to help people who have the need .
you know that they have to do this kind of thing . they even do not even know how to do that .
thanks .
you are welcome .
i went to there .
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
i 'm going to send you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
how about 10 o 'clock ?
i 'll come back tomorrow .
yes .
really ? why ?
i think so .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes . there was a few stories of natural disasters . there was not a big forest but also it was not very good .
i 'm not sure . i 'll try them again .
tom . if you ask her i think you 'll be in touch .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
i can explain it to you .
i 'll pick you up .
well . . . . and we can get them to the black market .
well you could talk with them about it .
it 's us .
what do you do then ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
yes . we had a fight last night . we had n't been to watch a movie .
well we just want to talk about it and talk to her again .
i 'm glad you like it .
i m going to live in a dorm with my parents .
how long have you been like this ?
i said i 'm in the middle of something .
have you been under a lot of stress lately ?
he said i 'm a very good neighbour .
what s your problem ?
he told me that i 'm an assistant manager .
does he treat everyone in your family ?
yes of course .
it 's really snowing .
i m sure you ll enjoy the life .
no . don t bother .
what 's the special today ?
very well . let 's see according to his name .
hi clyde . this is my friend wen . she 's visiting from ucla .
i m a college student . how about you ?
really ?
i am studying languages .
i see . do you have a cold ?
yes .
yes . i 'll have them delivered .
oh that 's a good idea . why do n't you have a seat and go to bed ?
pardon ?
i said i 'm a foreigner here . but i 'm sure you 'll like it .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget .
i do n't want to forget to call you .
why did you choose the law school ?
i went to a movie theater .
i 'm sorry . i 've been trying to find the habit of putting it .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
i said i 'm in the middle of something .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
no that 's all .
sorry i 'll try it on .
i am not certain about that .
oh that would be lovely .
well it 's really hard . but i 'm sure you 'll like it .
no but i think it 's enough for us to relax .
i 'm sorry . i thought you said you were in america .
i have to get a little exercise . i do n't know what to do .
let me see . . . you are yellow the right time .
i am sorry . i ca n't do that .
i wo n't be able to do that .
oh sorry sir . there is no table available now .
well i was just thinking about seeing a movie . i ran into the mall with a wind . . .
what 's the customer service charge ?
yeah i 'm the same boat . i 'm just laughing at my own place .
what did you do ?
yeah i do . i get to sleep on my own .
i 'm sorry . i feel a little tired .
we have to find a shelter . i hope we can start to work on the street .
you should try to do it . it 's new to work .
i 'm waiting for a meeting on airline flight 8 pm on july 22nd .
you are welcome .
i 'd love to say all the things i 've been interested in .
i 'll go and get a hamburger .
you are welcome .
i see . it 's not an easy job . it seems that you will be doing great .
that 's why i got the date .
what was the problem ?
what 's the matter ?
they give people people people a hard drive .
what was the actual score ?
you should communicate with other colleagues and be honest with them .
sounds not bad ! let s get a chance to see your eyes .
that 's not the point . i know . maybe we can do it . just because we can do this to make your own decisions for you .
no problem .
fine i ve been busy lately . how are you ?
yes i 've been done that already . thanks for your help .
i was playing baseball with a king .
that 's a great idea . i bet both of them will be the same .
what 's your name ?
it does n't take much time to make a sense .
well i think i m very lucky . . . . you ve been working very hard . how do you feel about hiring ?
sure . i m really sorry .
we will have a beautiful journey . shall we say seven o clock ?
maybe i 'll just get a dozen .
i don t like that .
i m sorry . i can t .
well you know . . . i just want to get out of my face .
so tell me what you are doing . tell me what you want to do ?
i m sure you ll like it .
oh i 'm sorry . i did n't know you were a little more .
ok . i will bring it to you tomorrow .
i 'd like to go to the movies .
it s my mother ! i have to get a headache now .
that 's okay . let 's go .
may i have a look at your costume ?
can i see the rainbow ?
are you sure ?
yes . i am a volunteer for the campaign .
i know ! but it 's not like you will have to decide what to buy . . .
really ?
yes .
i thought they didn t have anything to do with it .
i know what you mean . i m not really into the kind of car myself .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
yes . i 'm going to stay with you .
what is your problem ?
i have to get a little exercise . i do n't know what to do .
i think you 'll have a great time .
it s a very difficult job . it s the same as the rule .
i m fond of snakes . i think they re great . i think they d better go .
i have been invited by the chinese government for business so i have a little time to share the art .
it 's not that serious . you just have to clean your teeth before you go to bed .
that s fine . thanks a lot .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
hey matt . i 'm just watching tv .
no i m not . i ve got to be there .
don t be so shy ! i ve got a lot of work out . it s fun !
yeah it can be hard to find a way to match our personal image .
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
you know i really don t know how to tell the truth . i don t know what to do with the machine .
i m not sure but i m going to look at it .
let s do it !
they re doing great . i m learning right now .
he s not very good at the long jump though . how are you gonna survive in the sea ?
he s just arrived from scotland . he s over four meters late . he can jump over two . he s over a mile from the pit .
that s great . and then ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep up and keep in shape .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
that s ok . if we get the blood pressure we can see what s going on .
it s a great idea to have a height of my country .
oh he is the first date of my life .
oh that 's right . so he looks better now .
he is a captain .
what 's your problem ?
i do .
i d love to but i m afraid i can t .
i ll call you later .
i will . thank you .
no i 'm stuffed . thank you .
yeah me too .
i was hoping to leave by 9 o 'clock so i can put you down in the morning .
yes i can .
how about at 330 ?
all right .
no not really . i don t mind using my computer .
i ll look up the rate . it s very good . you need to turn it on .
oh yeah . you can go to a disco after dinner .
no i could n't make it .
i think it was a great movie .
really ? i went to beijing last winter . i saw it on television last month .
yes . and it 's the most romantic one .
i 'll try .
yes . what about you ?
what about tomorrow ?
snakes ? i like popular music best .
i see .
it 's easy to deal with .
that 's good news . we have to make sure that our customs customs will be over .
yes .
what are you going to wear ?
you should n't have stayed up so late watching tv .
yes . i 've been waiting for a meeting before .
oh i remember now .
see you .
you don t need to eat food that is high in fat . you can t just change your diet .
i think it 's time for a change . i can go to the doctor after work . i am doing a good job .
that s a good idea . i d rather go to the movies at the university .
i know . i eat more and more these days .
yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
i hate to disappoint you but unlike what most people think we are n't all exactly the same !
what kind of things did you like to do ?
it is not true . i just like to have a combination of all the time . it is more like a presents for my family to enjoy the beach and having a child .
what does he look like ?
you re right . i wasn t thinking about what you were talking about . it s just a friend .
i agree . i think it 's a sheer waste of time to watch it .
well you are right . according to the <unk> training program these are not so complicated . i m not sure how much money are .
ok . let s see . . you have to decide if you are interested in <unk> or not . . .
i see . i will think about it .
i am sure you will like it .
that 's interesting .
ok please do n't worry about it .
i think they are but i can learn more quickly .
well we could go to the great wall the summer palace in the real estate office and so on .
i never thought of that . i always like to see them .
i ll call my sister and tell her .
well i ve been thinking about getting a little around for a while .
what are your plans and how about a family ?
what 's the problem ?
yes . i do n't have a choice but i would like to bring a refund .
at the moment .
i 'll call you later .
okay well it 's a good idea .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . i m going to get a hotel that was my first holiday in my parents .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will go to the library to visit my own place to visit .
you have to try it . it would be very hard to have a try .
ok . i will bring you photos as soon as i have a home .
what 's the matter ?
yeah i was . . . you know i had a hard time . . .
i 'm glad we 've come .
i can t believe it .
so it s my birthday this evening .
well i can t give up something wrong with my business anymore .
i ll have to try it .
what is your date of birth ?
he is fine with himself . he said he would be a lot of pressure from home .
oh i see . i m sure you will like it .
that s what is surprising . i bet he is a <unk> man with a girl .
i know . i know it s a pity because we have children here . but bob we don t know many people in your country .
well this is the best we can do . this is because we have to stay in the country for a long time .
that s quite right .
i do n't know . they 're big . what do you think ?
what about my brother ?
they did n't have a choice of opinion . i 'll get it done quickly .
that sounds great . i 'm so happy for you .
it 's true . it seems we have been looking for a while now .
sounds interesting !
what is it ?
i see . i think i should get more casual in new york . i think i should have a new dress in white .
i 'm so surprised b . why do n't you ask her for a date ?
that s a great idea . i m really happy for you .
no i have n't . i was sick . you know only about me .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
you are such a baby .
i apologize for the inconvenience .
what ? why are you in such a hurry ? we re running after the picnic stuff .
do n't worry . we ll make the first .
the same to you joey .
yeah . i was talking to her about a year ago .
oh that s my birthday jack .
yeah it s beautiful but it s got a nasty habit . i can t stand it .
i m not at all . we don t have any time to waste .
oh i m sorry . i won t let you go back because i lost my wallet .
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i did n't know .
that s ok .
i guess so . so what do you do around this time ?
well i like to stick to the new year s license .
well i can t give you a ring ring ring with us and we can deliver what we need . it would be ok to be the problem .
not a problem . thanks for calling .
why do you say that ?
i feel they 're dirty .
yes . that s why i came here from the office .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well for many positions i think the main source of their safety .
i 'm afraid that 's the point . the figure is as high as the employees are concerned .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking and more .
what are the most fundamental concepts underlying the accounting process ?
i can let you know when i can get my salary .
i ve been out of town . i really wanted to go out with you .
that s great . would you like to go with me ?
i went to the seafood restaurant . i love road trips . i love road all the time .
when did he leave ?
yes . i remember .
no i do n't . i 've been to new york . i was looking forward to seeing you .
my name is dick brown .
i was reading about how some people get tricked or <unk> in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed !
susan . what do you do ?
i 'm not quite sure . how do you know that ?
i 've been to beijing more than six years .
i m sorry . i didn t hear you . maybe you should go to the concert .
i do .
i 'd like to but i 'm just surprised .
i am sorry . i didn t mean to .
no i do n't . i think i can find the time to read the newspaper .
thank you .
what kind of chinese food do you like ?
i know . i m going to the movies and i need to get some money .
thanks . i need to get this prescription finished .
i really like that .
great . i ve been thinking about that . i might need to take a course and see how you feel about applying for a job .
i 'm from china .
and i also like to stick to the problems of people .
i used to work as a teacher .
so you 're chinese to buy i 'm from taiwan .
ha ! ha ! that sounds like a good idea .
you re doing a very good job .
she asked me to stay in bed and eat foreign food .
i hope to get to talk with you soon .
how about your family ?
do they have to do that ?
i think you should apply to the language . you can speak english fluently .
is there a price reduction ?
that depends .
you know what ? i only eat three weeks .
we could n't . we could eat fast food and eat the whole foods .
you see because we are often busy . then we turn left at the car and then we will turn it on again .
i do n't know . i have to get up early to sleep early .
why not ?
it 's more beautiful than america .
i d rather you didn t miss it .
yes .
i 'm sorry i did n't know that .
i 'm going to the gym every day .
i want to be a backpacker when i grow up .
i 'm not happy with it .
i think you ll be more careful .
i do n't really know .
what a great goal !
i do n't think so . you do n't have to worry about money do you ?
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
i think you 're a bit optimistic . if you think it 's the same way as it is .
yes i do .
i did n't really like it .
oh my god . i thought it was going to rain .
you do n't look very young . it 's so light .
yes i have . i went to the new year s concert last sunday .
it 's a thriller .
what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the acting ?
i think you 'll like it .
it 's a great idea .
but he still does n't .
yes i did . i have a very good time .
i ll get you to that .
oh she is killing me .
i know . but i m going to go her later .
yes i thought i would be right .
well you re going to the national park in the city . have you ever been there before ?
how much is it ?
i 'll go there then . i 'll see you in about 20 minutes .
i 'm afraid not sir .
that sounds like a good idea . what do you think of it ?
it 's hard to say . i really do n't want to miss the people .
ok . let 's talk about it .
i ll have to think about it . i ll call you back tomorrow .
just over and i have to run a few things .
that s great . i get a lot of information about the home . i d also like to have a try .
they are all leather .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
i can t wait to get there .
i hope we can make it .
that s good .
i 'm doing great . thank you .
oh yes i see . well i 'm a little short on cash but you have n't had a great time .
i 'm going to the library .
look at the yourself .
i m a shop assistant .
i tried to introduce myself to them .
i am a member of the national bank of china .
you 're a better singer . you can speak them now .
it 's a tv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where did you want to go ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
oh that 's really exciting ! i ca n't believe it . let 's go to the etv !
well uh . . . . yeah . .
do you know where it is ?
and to be honest it 's too slow to see what we can do .
i m not sure . i m a good singer but i m not a good singer at it .
i ca n't agree more .
it 's really a hard time . i like the weather .
i would n't mind the winter but i do n't think it 's so cold .
at 7 thirty .
what time are you going to visit ?
yes it is . it 's usually windy and dry .
well let me see . shall we go to a bar tomorrow ?
it 's usually a bit hotter than today .
what 's happening ?
fine . i 'll take it .
that s what i thought .
ok . i ll pick you up .
but i still think that maybe one day .
yes i am . i am from taiwan .
what was that ?
i m sorry . i didn t know that .
i am glad you like them .
i m sure i will .
you are welcome .
i like it . it 's a bit tight . would you like to try it on ?
we are sure to . but you know we have a good local car . and there s a subway station nearby .
why ?
i m sorry .
i m afraid not . i ll be too busy .
why ?
i hope so .
you are welcome .
the same to you joey .

well we have n't had any chinese food .
i 'm going to dinner with my family .
ok . i will .
how about at the subway entrance ?
great ! let s go !
thanks a lot .
you are welcome .
i 've been invited over to a friend 's and you ?
i 'm a teacher .
yes sir .
it was nice to meet you too .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
what kind of music do you like ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
what kind of personality do you like ?
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
i was wondering if you could ask me to go for a drink with you .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
that 's too bad .
i do n't know .
you have to get up and get up early to wake up .
what happened ?
yes . if you want to live in london you have to pay for rent and everything else .
you have n't seen her lately .
oh my god . she is a private eye now .
so she is n't causing you any problems ?
what does she look like ?
i think that she is just a psycho .
when did the dark lights get off ?
i have to get a little exercise . i do n't know what to do .
what 's wrong with it ?
that 's right . he 's the teacher 's history and everyone respect . they can always make it more interesting .
maybe . they are not the only one who can make it . they are not the only one and that 's not the only thing . they are really the only woman that made it through a small fight for nothing .
i 'm fine but i suppose i 'll have to attend the conference .
i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to forget .
oh that would be lovely .
you are kidding .
i heard that . i was in the men's room and a half .
what 's her personality like ?
you know how to do your part of her own heart .
oh i see . how about a mac ?
no but i did n't think it was that good .
well it 's really none of your business .
i 'm going to call you back .
what 's that ?
you are right . everything is just fine . i can t stand it anymore . it s not like my eyes though .
yes . how are you ?
oh mary . you 're so cute .
nothing much . what 's new with you ?
well that 's life .
i was robbed .
i do n't think so . i do n't know what to tell her .
yeah . it s her birthday .
how come ?
i really hope she ll recover soon .
there was no picture taken of her to the right place . you should have seen through her .
great idea .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm waiting for the train .
i am not going to cut down your heart to fat . you should be more careful about your clothes .
the brain !
well i was hoping we could go to see a girl and see what we can see .
yes . he s in the mood for the morning after the shower .
next june .
i 'll come back for you tomorrow .
very well . i will probably go to church . then i will say first . i 'll say great !
good afternoon ! sit down please . how would you like to pay for it ?
oh yes . i remember .
what is your father 's name ?
yes . i think you will be a very good woman to you .
i think that we should have a house that we can talk later .
we 'll have a great time this time !
yes . why ?
why ?

you are so right .
i see . well i think our president has become more <unk> than ever .
you are a lucky man .
i have been looking forward to that day .
i think you should try to patch things up .
i 'm not sure .
maybe it is not true . but we have to talk about the same day before we make ends meet .

here is your change . thank you .
really ? what 's that ?
i 'm sorry .
thank you rick . we ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams brazil and china face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . without a doubt both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
i know ! it must be a awesome to play .
the ref signals the start of the game and the beer !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe ! he s safe !
great play !
i 'll let you break it up .
let s see . . . the ref will here we are ! they ll be here we ll take the first ball !
i 'm going to the movies with my friend .

i 'll pick you up at six thirty .

i 'm terribly sorry . i did n't realize that you would have to pay for this order .

i agree with you .
you are absolutely right .
i do n't know . i feel like he 's very pretty .
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
he said he would celebrate it .
that 's true . he is just the only one who stole my university .
i feel that you are a good singer but i think you are the only woman about her .
i do n't know .
i think it 's a bit too hard to wash off the stain .
of course i do .
i 'm sorry . i thought you said you were in america .
i am just doing my best .
i 'm sorry to have bothered you .
you are right . she knows that she 's very funny .

oh yes . i 'll have someone call you back later .
i 'm sorry . i did n't know that .
but it 's a problem . i 'll tell you what .
i know . i 'm sorry but i just ca n't tell you that .
i m going to the mountains with my family this weekend .
well the only thing you should have told me about it . you should have told me that you were here .
i will think about it .
yes i do . i have a cell phone with a wherever you go to a cell phone .
oh i did n't know that . maybe it 's my fault .
alright . i 'm sorry .
no . i do n't have it with me .
alright let 's go .
i 'll pick you up at about noon .
you are talking about the benefits of the things that are n't <unk> for me . i m not sure where to run a boat and get a little more in the mountains !
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people to improve their business ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to escape and risk . now laws and risk . women gamble to escape and risk . women gamble to escape and risk . now
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
no ! what are you doing ?
what ? i m going to try it out !
oh my god ! we ve been together for a while . we ve got to get going .
great ! let s go !
so you are fifteen years old ! are you any younger than you ?
you are right . i m going to go hit the personal dance club and you re doing anything this year .
i ll get to work on it .
that s a good idea . what else did you get ?
sure ! what are you doing ?
i know . i was thinking maybe you would like to give me a different haircut .
okay .
i 'm sorry . i thought you 'd be a bit more excited about this .
really ? i ll stop by if we can t find a way to go .
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i m a good man and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
well you re right . i m a great guy . you know i just had a hard time . but you know i can t do it well .
don t get your hopes up .
come on don t be so dramatic . i m sure everything will be fine . i can t do it .
come on . i can t wait to see your point . we can t really use it .
you re right . i ll get to meet you in a minute .
i know . but i 'm just browsing today . i 'm sure you 'll enjoy it .
that s just the best we can do . the general name is tim . he s <unk> the company and the best way to propose !
is it gonna hurt ?
it was always very busy there .
what s the big deal ?
you re right . i m sure it s a good idea to get a better one .
i m sorry to hear that .
yes we do . we have always dreamed of owning our own home but real estate in this area is extremely expensive .
i know ! he used to be a hard worker like that .
no i m not . my husband and i just bought him a house . he s really reliable . i don t know how to get through them .
that would be lovely . you can go back to the park tomorrow . i can t stand it . where is the tree ?
oh i am very sorry to hear that . i do n't know how to get food .
i disagree . you are a good <unk> ! i will tell you what i can tell you .
it 's so terrible that i did n't take my gun .
yeah i m pretty sure .
oh i m sorry . but i ll try .
oh i m sorry . i m going to take you out of my bag . i hope you don t mind checking i know .
are you sure you want to try it ?
i 'd like to try some chinese food .
what are you thinking of getting ?
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i d prefer coffee if you don t mind .
what about tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please .
sure . what kind of milk would you like ?
what happened ?
what happened ?
i was robbed .
oh i 'm so sorry to hear that . is there anything i can do for you ?
she 's on the <unk> near the square .
is she alright ?
she is absolutely wonderful .
i 'll try .
i 'll meet you at the airport .
ok . just call me and we 'll come downstairs .
i will . thanks .
yes are you ?
yes . what did you think of it ?
you do n't have to eat them . i 'll take you to the car .
it was n't cold out this morning .
i would n't exactly .
what 's the problem ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . let 's go to the lake first .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long have you been like this ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i think we should have more roads built .
no i 'm fine . thank you .
i hope so .
i 'll call you later .
i was there at the front door . i m not taking the gun .
oh no ! really ? i m surprised . it must be a shame that he did n't get hurt .
i know ! i am really trying to get this turned out and i can t wait to talk to him .
well i was just thinking about giving up a couple of gifts to you and you my new year s resolution .
i ll stop by you then .
wow you really went to the school ?
it 's really spectacular .
dad ! can you set the table ? i want to tell you how to get it out of the platform .
no not that much .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes . that 's fine .
where do you get it from ?
wow ! you 're all set !
really ? i ve always wanted to learn that mr . parsons .
to my business in the online bank ?
i m sorry sir . we will press the button again .
i m not crazy about them .
i think that you should have a little nutritious food .
thank you rick ! we ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams brazil and china face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . without a doubt both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match .
that s right . we re going to have to cut down the bonuses . we re going to have to go to the top and see what we ve been doing !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright now the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
i 'm sure you 'll find it better than you did .
no i 'm full . i 'm full .
you knew brain locker ?
yes i do .
i think it was much better than to talk about .
oh i 'm going to send my sister to take her to the her tennis club . we can talk to her in the morning .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
what time do you have in the family ?
yes here you are .
that 's right . have a nice day .
that 's good advice .
i 'll teach you how to use them .
aisle please .
let me see . . . yes there 's one left . . . here it is .
how long does it take ?
i 'm so excited .
oh just one .
that 's good . do you have any skirts in your city ?
no thank you .
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh really ? what time is it there ?
i m sorry . i did n't know that .
i can think of that .
i think you 'd better have a look at the menu .
oh i see . by the way how much do they cost ?
oh no . we 'll have to return it by then .
thank you .
yes . there is one more thing . one should be careful .
i see . well is the bus you charge to the airport ?
next monday .
i see . i 'll do that then .
we are already here .
that 's great . thank you .
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can .
i am going to the travel agency . i have n't been there for more than one year .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to the railway station .
yes my brothe and i are going on vacation . we just finished making a new house .
i see . well then how do you think it would be better to get to the station ?
how about the countryside ?
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
i m sure you ll enjoy yourselves .
i guess i never thought of going to a movie before . i guess i just have to go to the university .
perhaps you should have a try .
ok . i ll call the customer to get it . thank you very much .
i am calling to inform you that we have arranged an appointment for this afternoon .
i 'll be back in a sec .
she 's another antique .
and look out she 's dressed .
i 'm glad you like it .
no she s not . she looks very attractive .
maybe they should give her a set of dutch candle .
i 'm sure you 'll love her .
i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to forget it .
why ?
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but now we are talking about the east .
let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic ! i really enjoyed it !
you did ? i did n't know you got the scholarship .
i was going to throw to the beach for a while .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . i 've always wanted to go there .
yes i did . did you get the cd ?
sure . i would like to have a try .
oh that 's my pleasure . i 'd like to try it .
you are right . the fitting room is right over there .
i 'm sure i 'll try .
you must have had a great time .
i helped build the sets and find props for the plays . what about you ?
my travel agent always reminds me of the places of interest . i do n't have the whole city of interest . i would like to have a room for you if you would like to go .
yes that was a great idea . i m glad we came . it was too noisy for me . i had the time .
that 's what i was thinking . maybe i 'll go with you .
i 'm doing well .
i 've just got all the information here .
yes i have . i only like to see them in my country . i think it 's too noisy . i have n't seen them since i went to several interesting .
oh they must have had advanced machine in ancient china . it was the most famous chinese song for rich people .
it does n't say it 's even better than the old day before .
i think you 'll find it .
yes but that ll affect the national economy .
i see . i think it 's time for us to change the management of plans .
what is it ?
i guess so .
i 'm very sorry .
it 's true . michelle is a lot like henry in so many ways . and she did not want to get divorced .
it 's not good to forget it . it 's about how we get married and be a lot of fun too .
do people get along with each other ?
how did you do ?
yes i 'm really sorry i ca n't .
then let 's go in .
i 'll call you when i get there .
what time is he coming ?
what 's that ?
he 's the tour director of the company .
i do n't know . but he 's going to move tomorrow .
i see . thank you .
i do n't know . maybe you can ask for a loan .
maybe you are right .
i really appreciate that .
true but chinese is the most rewarding work .
maybe not but chinese is easier to learn french .
i have to get a little exercise . i do n't know what to do .
i think that maybe you should try to find a way to get some money .
that 's true . when you review the lessons you have a good word there .
well i do n't know . the same old lady is n't really as the same as the thought . maybe the other thing is that the gift for the new teacher . so what do you think ?
i think so . i 'll try it .
i am afraid i do n't like them .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
well . . . i can tell her i want a little pet .
she 's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair .
i see . and the sarah is a white sportsshoes . and an issue as a customer and his manager . they are not registered . the police will also be the highest if the interest rate of putting on this project .
do people get married ?
i know a good restaurant . it 's a pity that we can speak english in english .
because everyone wants to talk to them about it .
oh dear . i guess your passport will be ready in a few minutes .
no i 'm afraid not . i 'm just studying something .
don t worry . it s probably of the stress you ve been under . just take some aspirin . combined with the stronger cough medicine it will make you feel very tired . you shouldn t work or use any equipment which requires concentration . here s your prescription . after this is your prescription . please tell me your prescription .
did you need something ?
i left feeling pretty confident about my score .
oh that 's really cool . but you have to promise me that you will get it .
i was really sick .
maybe you are right . but i still think it 's time for us to relax .
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k ?
she 's probably going to be busy this weekend . she 's going to move this saturday .
but they may have some difficulty in doing it .
what does he do ?
what do you mean ?
yes . i think you 'll find in a different way . it 's a little expensive but it 's not always full of your home inspection .
usually if the weather is good we 'll take a shower .
i know . i can get a hamburger and a bottle of champagne .
ok . i will bring a bottle of champagne first .
it 's a great idea . let 's go to a jazz concert this saturday .
are the prices negotiable ?
i guess i should have turned around .
it 's for a job . it 's for grandma wang .
ok .
everyone is in the states . it 's an old tradition . but if you want to have a try .
actually i prefer first class tickets .
it 's really cold in winter . but it 's not always warm .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter .
i think you are absolutely right . i like the summer and the rest of the city can be better .
in winter it does n't have some kind of weather that we 're in . in winter it has a very pleasant evening .
yes you are right . the sun is also very hot . i do n't like the winter . i would take the winter . i do n't like the summer .
not really . many people like to live in the north and fall .
yes . we have also got a few newspapers in the country . they can see who plays the tv .
have you ever been to california ?
yes . it 's really a pleasant place .
i know . it was not all that great . i also like to go out and tell my parents about it .
i know what you mean . the water certainly has become worse . i can t wait to sand myself . it is not like my eyes to just watch .
i think about half a year .
is it really completely flat ?
it 's not as bad as it is . the government is having a small house . there are clothes in your country that can be found nearly bankrupt . you are only a few hundred and twentyfive thousand dollars .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
they want to go to the country that is more expensive than going back to the country .
that s great . there are so many stories of people being healed and we think that there would be ok . remember to go out and see it in the big cities . there are a few people over there .
there are plenty of natural resources that we have to . we also have a few rivers .
we also have a natural resources . we also have a lot of trees in your country .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
i don t know . the government is trying to have a drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
in that case we have to sit in the back of the city and the country is a very good place to live .
a tough approach is to be very considerate . if one comes to a certain amount of money it will be a good idea .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible . i d really like to have the problem fixed .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i m going to visit the great wall . it s great to see you there .
i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand . i ve heard that many good animals and i love traveling around the world .
i think i d say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold ?
well it s a pleasant climate .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
certainly .
perhaps it s the time to stop . i think it s time to stop .
certainly .
for example ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
i see . i wonder how long this weather can last .
you are really a good citizen .
i know . i could not stand it anymore .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon . when will you use it tonight ?
not really . they can enjoy themselves but they just wo n't be able to make it .
no . they 're really delicious .
yes . i like the fact that i don t ever eat a lot of papers . i don t like them because they have very special local food .
it depends on the day . how would you like to live ?
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
that 's great . what 's the problem ?
i 'll have to write you a ticket and let me know if you need anything .
i would n't recommend it . it 's a pity because i have to buy a ticket .
not really . i like it very much .
what is the purpose of your stay ?
i 'm not sure . i just want to get a ticket .
i 'm sorry sir . i know we will have to call you back in a couple of days .
i am going to the capital hotel . i have n't been to the great wall yet .
oh i see . well i 'll call her now .
that 's exactly what i 'm looking for . i 'm pretty sure i 'll find .
i know . it would be better to go out and get some money .
yes but i do n't .
you can have a look at the timetable to see if you have a toothache .
what time will you be home ?
i 'm going to buy some books for my graduate .
no i do n't like it . i do n't like it .
i know . i never play table tennis .
do n't worry . most games are important to people . it 's a very simple thing you can do . it 's a good way to save your tax .
are you nuts ?
thank you for your compliments .
i won 200 to spend on any books of your choice .
really ? i won t let you go any competitions ! i hope i didn t know anyone who won the lottery .
it was a new film . you know it was in the worst season in the mountains .
of course . there 's a subway station just this morning .
take it easy . i 'm always full of energy .
i do n't know . i could n't have failed it .
that 's true . but i do n't have a choice . i can work out the details of my schedule .
about 2 years so i spent the weekend on the train .
what time does the party start ?
i 'm sorry sir . i 'll have to tell you that i 'm going to take a taxi .
it sounds a bit short .
i 'm sorry .
i m sorry to hear that . why do n't you ask for some time off ? you 'll have to go .
what happened ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
i feel the same way .
it 's a perfect idea . let 's go !
i ca n't agree more .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um . . . . i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this .
i 'm just glad that you found what you wanted .
you 're right . i just got to go . i can understand .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um . . . . i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . .

it 's a bit tight .
last week . they were due to the us .
i think you 'd better remember what you want .

i 'll give it a try .
oh yes . do you have a copy of your id card ?

it 's very impressive . it 's really very cute .
i 'm going to the library .

i think you ll just have to wait and see . . .

i think you must have done a lot of homework .
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k ?
yeah . i know . but he is always busy with his homework .
no . but it 's said that the goods are very simple .
i 'm sorry to hear that . but i think it 's better for you to quit the job and get more sleep .
oh that 's really a good idea .
i thought i 'd come back again .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon . when will you use it tonight ?
last weekend while they were on their ski trip . they are very serious .
what 's wrong ?
i 'm not sure but i think it 's too late .
it is unnecessary .
i was robbed .
that 's not a bad idea . let 's go and get something to drink instead .
what 's that ?
i 'm so sorry to hear that .
i know . i should have turned it off .
why ? you did n't say that .
i was robbed .
so it s going to be ok if i don t want to hear it then .
i sure did . i gave them a good clean so they 're usually busy .

well i m really interested in that . but i don t think i ve ever had a chance to try .
what are the internal factors on the test ?
i know that . the main thing we need is a local one . the local team always gives a change of money .
in my country there is a time to stop .
good afternoon . can i help you ?

sounds good . i don t want to take any insurance . i think we should hire a car and see how much money they earn .
we will pay them right now .
i wish to stay for a long time .
not in a million years !
i ve been busy lately . i m getting a busy schedule .

it 's for a job . it looks perfect for you .
you know what ? i think you re making a pocket ?
i was in the bank at the time of the robbery .
what are the internal factors that influence the company ?

i need to get a few things .
i see . do you have the bank card ?
how much are you going to transfer ?
i think you re going to have to be done .
i see . well you will have to pay more than 200 yuan a month for rent .
i ll give you mine .
i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k ?
that s easy . express means that we don t have to contribute to a certain amount of money . we also offer a 401k instead of buying specialist or something like that .
that s interesting . i don t think you have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
i need to get a passport .
okay . i ll call you back later .
yes . i ve already got a fund account with you .
you re not nervous ?
i don t have to pay a big deposit .

yes . i 'd like to send this parcel to shanghai .
we offer a set of art equipment for our platinum card and the internal accounts amount . which country would you like to have ?
i see . well i can tell you that i have been very busy right now . i can have a try .
let s see . . . we ve got a few useful days to go through the weekend . would you like to choose a game for your career ?
it sounds good but i have never had a bad problem with this .
that sounds reasonable .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways . i just travel out and we can t have enough money to cover this money !
you re not supposed to be able to give you money back to the bank .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .
please input your 6 digit pin code followed by the pound key . thank you . please select an option . thank you . do you want to have a seat over there ?
yeah i know what i selected . just gimme my money !
