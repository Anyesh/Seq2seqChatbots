have you a better idea ?
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .

that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that might be going overboard a bit . how about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing .
that s even better than the real thing .
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than 100 you get a 50 voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
sure . the fitting room is right over there .
i 'd like to have a look at your air conditioners . hum this one looks pretty good .

right . we 'll take it .
how about 630 ?
good .
shall i bring your luggage here ?
yes and i love the food there .
right . the climate here is quite large . but why do people go on the high street so it s cheaper to buy a place that makes the receipts for their sake ?
really ? that 's interesting ! i 'd like to go to a chinese restaurant .
that 's something that you really need to work on .
have you got a copy of the film ?
yes i can . it s a very friendly place to live in .

you 're welcome .
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
do you know what to eat ?
how much is it ?
i 'm not sure yet . there 's still a special restaurant with some of them .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .

yes ?
um this steak i asked for to be medium rare .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
she 's a lawyer .
is she strict ?
i know . maybe i should go home to bed .
and you 've done a lot of homework .
one moment . do you want to withdraw some cash while you 're at it ?
i can t find you clearly on that . you ve got to get this class .
when do you expect to come ?
why do n't you use wooden cases and the rest ?
are you scared of anything ?
would you please wait a moment ? i will check the order .

the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
only about twenty minutes .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
all right .

i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .

are you having any luck ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few rummage sales on saturday . i think i ll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate 9 from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at kimble s department store .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at <unk> s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .
um ninetyfive dollars ?
yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen 's boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
well a friend of a friend who works out in a friend .
well a friend of a friend .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
yeah . let me see . according to the exchange rate the dollar is rib only .
no it 's not so easy . just take the shirt back to the men 's department and show them the sales slip . they will exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund .
how do i use the key to go ?
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .
what a good idea !
what kind shall we get ?
we could go to more places this time if you liked .
yes fine .
when shall we go and look ?
why not sometime next week ?
no let 's go on saturday .
ok .
i know your friend will like the gift set especially the teddy bear .

you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
is that you like it ?
how about oil or spray ?
sure .
what time would you like to take the test ?
could you deliver it tomorrow ?
so you want to send it by air tomorrow morning ?

what 's the time we 're always busy on weekdays ?
yes . my manager is sick and i can call him again later .
is it available ?
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
i 've never had a mango .
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
you can buy them either ripe or unripe . unripe ones are hard .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
we can eat from that bank .
mangoes ? what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
can you eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
maybe i could interest you in one of his works at the moment .
it 's 150 yuan each and the price is 1 .
really ? i 'm afraid it must be too expensive . can you show me something cheaper ?
what are you thinking ?

how much are they ?

can you eat the nut ?
no you peel off the skin and throw out the nut .
how much are they ?
they are 168 .
what does a mango taste like ?
they 're like a citrus fruit .
how do i know if it 's ripe ?
you can buy them hard . wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel .

a very powerful 2 . 5 liter turbocharged engine trust me this car is fast !

it is located at the east foot of western mountain of beijing in a park with the same name . there are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer so it is called fragrant mountain .

why are you applying for a visa ?

hi daddy . it s me troy .
yeah you 're right .
thank you . where should i send your final phone bill ?
yes i 'm . and you ?
i promise i 'll pay you back as soon as we get home .
okay but the sent by any questions were for you .
see you .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello steven !
wow what a lovely dog ! how did you do that ?
it was almost two years ago . i just wanted to come down from work .
i am doing ok thank you .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
well ! really ?
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
ok ! by the way do you know you are a very good employee ?
what time are you leaving ?
do n't you hit it off ?
i began to went there last month .
i see .
she 's pretty goodlooking . she 's always busy at work .
what is her strongest trait ?
oh no . during the summer vacation i think it 's a good opportunity for you to relax .
why ? what a pity ! he must have taken good records in english !
what happened ?
thank you sir . we can book you a table for 4 at 8 00 .
but i 'm not sure how to do it . i 'm going to be late . i 'll have the time to look .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
i can take you through this direction without any problems !
what are you talking about ?
yeah ! i would say that again ! oh no ! i thought we might have left it for a long time !
where is the fire station ?
i know ! we ve got a ticket that rash here !
uh i guess i 'm just gonna get used to it .
some people are supposed to check their fat . just be careful !
i know i know . i m not going to put a crime into run .
i m looking for a sweater .
have you brought your credentials ?
i ll have my hair washed . i don t have an allergy . can you give me a few minutes ?
have you brought your camera ?
yes that 's an excellent one . since the most important part i have to take the relevant data and <unk> the loan .
sure i do .
thank you .
so what are the best way to travel ?
thanks you too . my wife has been holding a car for a while .
i m sorry . i don t want any red envelopes . i think we should buy a packet of cigarettes and a few pints of milk too .
wow ! this is really huge . what is it ?
that s ok . i can remember how you put all the way on the top of that ?
and what is it that you 're interested in ?
i do n't think so . but i like this one .
well it looks like you have to leave .
that s right .
that 's too bad .
no problem anytime .
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
is this salami and bologna you have here ?
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes . i did .
no way ! i have to turn it off right now !
can you put something in this report ?
well . . . actually it did n't have a chance to tell the truth . she would never change my mind . we do n't want to get part in the kitchen .
so let s move on to the bedroom ?
it would be a little more expensive on the house .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
what size are you ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's a big garden . i like it very much .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
well that s a great idea . the coffee and the grill is incredible .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
maybe we could get some new furniture . better stuff .
i have n't thought of that .
yes it has two bedrooms . that 's convenient .
can i have the bill now ?
the rent is 1500 per month .
that s way too much .
you re not going to be able to make these items today .
what do you mean ?
let me see . . . it 's 57 dollars including tax .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you please reconsider ?
okay . you re hired .
no i m afraid not . i m going to be late for lunch .
i love it . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . it gives me a real sense of satisfaction . do you enjoy cooking ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah i buy it for parents to personally . it s really not easy to eat any food . i never buy any supermarket .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
all right . please make yourself coffee .
i 'll take one on the yellow floor . how much is it ?
the size is fine . i want one of this sweater .
you have made a good choice in the market . would you like to have it delivered to your house ?
it s going to be a lot of expensive running shoes .
well i think you can say that i m really pleased with the packing .
i m afraid i can t . i ve got enough on my feet !
the red one fits me well . can i have a picture of the black one ?
ok .
a formal suit please .
thank you . i think you will like it .
i hope so .
this is he . how can i help you ?
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
are you on the apartment floor or at home ?
i believe that it would be better for me to find a place in this apartment .
i can help you find one for rent .
that sounds good . i will see you then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
it 's the two of us . we will go there .
you 're welcome .
should i bring anything with me ?
no but if you need to check out this video . i am afraid that i can use it for you .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
do you like the color ?
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it has two bedrooms . that 's convenient .
right now that s a bit too far away .
i know .
with so few windows how can you even see what the problems are ?
that 's like a dark angel .
could you wait for a minute ? i think i could get some fresh towel .
the best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom .
let me help it .
only one .
it is ! look at this ! it is amazing ! the refrigerator is coming with me !
let s sign it for a moment .
what are you going to do ?
sure .
where 's the parking structure ?
wow ! this place is really beautiful ! it s so romantic !
i asked grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two birds with one .
thank you .
<unk> .
i 'm sorry he 's having an important meeting now . can i help you ?
hello lucy . this is mary . i 'm calling to confirm our meeting tomorrow .
do you ca n't see it ?
you bet . i 'll be able to live with you on your weekend .
what is it ?
i have no problem with 6 p . m .
we 'd better not give it any more .
i 'll be waiting for you .
we have a deal with parents .
should i bring anything with me ?
no but if you bring some foldup chairs for people do you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
i 'd like to have a look at your air conditioners . hum this one looks pretty good .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
yes please .
yes .
i promise i 'll pay you back as soon as we get home .
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i promise i 'll pay you back as soon as we get home .
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
oh i 'm glad to hear that .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
do you know how short you want your hair to be ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
there 's just one thing .
not really . cut back on the ears and perm a tie .
how about your hair ?
no problem . i think it 's a good idea to have some tied up all day .
what style do you want ?
i hope so . i 'm really tired of this oldfashioned style that i 've been wearing .
as a matter of fact i 'm really glad to do so .
no you can cut back on your arm to the grill . i 'm afraid it will be too cold for a glass .
could you tell us your specials today ?
to the right .
i promise i 'll pay you back as soon as we get home .
no you 're right . i also had a few friends .
i know . and why do you say that ?
i like that . i think my brother will help .
it 's smashed in .
no thank you . i 'll go right now .
yes . we 'll be here in time .
ok . after that you can pick up the sound of the interviewer .
thank you . your curly hair is not so short .
let 's see .
oh yes . that 's why i am looking for a <unk> job is very quiet and quiet .
what ? are you busy ?
ok . i ll help you with the food there .
ok let 's go check out the kitchen next .
i don t like her husband that bad egg but my daughter insists on <unk> him .
ok . is it on the market right now ?
i do but if you hear about it i would have seen you for a long time .
yes i have very much .
where is it ?
how long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?
sure . we can go look at both of them .
is that very convenient ?
where is it ?
why did n't you find out if it is true ?
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
where is it ?
it only sounds complicated . a lot of people here in our office thinks you have to learn how to set his own habits and the words on the network .
actually the government could go to the conference room and enjoy some information while we have to study at home . if you want to go there you can try and buy a few things .
sure . we need to stay together and enjoy our tour .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
would you like some more rice or noodles with your dessert ?
i 'd like to have chinese food .
i am from south america . i like chinese food .
i 'm not really into chinese food .
well it looks very nice .
my absolutely favorite kind of pie is apple .
that 's why it 's so popular . many of our customers love is it . if i 'm in some color noodles with special sauce we 'd like to try some <unk> rice .
not at all . i usually try something else on . what about you ?
that 's right . you really should do some jogging from breakfast .
sounds like a good idea .
cindy help me order because i do n't have any dish in my american cooking . as a rule we have different tastes .
an attendant does n't know the way to taste it .
hmm . . . you 're right . there are three french perfumers . com right ?
sure we can help you find some information about . when we can go to the butcher 's and find some information for you .
that would be nice . there is a lot of room for improvement . i 'm sure you will like to take it .
so what are the washing machine ?
but what about him ? i know he will be responsible for that .
no you can only take your time .
alright . who is your name ?
you 're welcome .
actually it 's a bit too small but it 's a bit expensive . i just need to just a few clothes .
i don t like her husband that bad egg but my daughter insists on <unk> him .
the price of yours is ok . but i just want it to be special .
you know that i like them but they 're not very familiar with the taste .
when do you begin ?
the are chemical materials <unk> . they are widely used in ancient china .
can i find something similar to other brands ?
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
but i want to get a pair of shoes that i don t wear rather than keeping them .
i do n't know . i ca n't think i 'm ready for a lift .
what about ?
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
that 's strange . i was told by the company that the owners were looking for their vacancy at another magadize . told me that the job might be the real thing about how much i wanted to get the job .
the afternoon at four .
do you prefer something to drink ?
you 'll have to pay 25 every time you overdraft .
how about some kind of exercise ?
ok . we can go to the bank together .
i 'm looking for a pair of shoes .
let me see . oh i am sorry sir . he is holding out an order for you .
i lost it .
you have made a good choice . coming to us .
i want to return this cellphone .
go and try it on .
alright . i 'll see you later .
i 'll take one .
i understand .
my husband said i would go to other ticket . is that all right ?
oh i 'm sorry but i 've already been working on this .
i am afraid i ca n't help you sir . i 'm just calling about your safety position .
i will be there in april so i think you can make it .
i 'm here for a letter of credit . you see i 'm here to help .
here you are .
all right . now you can take your case away
well . we 'd like to pay by credit card .
here 's the receipt .
sure go ahead .
i am disappointed with your work lately .
do i have any other choices ?
is anyone else sick in your home ?
anything else ?
have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?
well i guess it could be a lot worse than they are . so when the chinese people feel they were destroyed sometimes .
yeah i know . but i hate cooking !
come on ! don t be so dramatic ! i m sure you can just enjoy your dinner !
that sounds like a plan .
how about the umbrella ? it 's very beautiful .
you 're right . i just feel sleepy .
no i did n't know . i did n't know many of them . but now i can always sleep on .
yes i did . but they were too busy .
i 'm not really interested in it .
that 's really a foul ! i m glad to hear that ! okay here is my card .
you should try my best .
yeah i ll start drinking and having a cup of coffee that i m going to let you know how to practise cooking !
you 've got it .
that s a good idea . you should do the same thing .
mainly seascapes .
you forgot all about it ! we have stars . com and in heaven all year . we should also cook that night instead of eating healthy and have no night cream to avoid .
yes most of our customers do .
wow what a beer ! now we have to bring a lot of gifts to celebrate !
i 've never been spicy food .
yeah . i always eat the food that i eat but i still eat the same before i was younger .
my absolutely favorite kind of pie is apple .
oh i 'm awfully sorry . i do n't feel like the tv .
first of all i need to make a list of all the things that we need to take with .
it 's not a bad thing . they are as affectionate as dogs are n't they ?
all right i 'm almost finished . can you hold the bellboy to pick up your luggage at 900 a . m .
all right .
thank you . i think i should have a taste of red wine .
of course . it 's ok with cold water .
you can buy 1 000 yuan a week and i 'll get some ice cream .
you did a lot of weight . this machine is absolutely wonderful .
and now we 'll have some real coffee .
what sort of salary do you want ?
sounds good . i 'll try it .
no problem . thank you for everything .
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not . do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
yes i 'm really sorry .
i do n't know what to cook .
what do you want to eat ?
i do n't know .
me too . do you want some chinese food ?
i was thinking of pizza .
i see .
okay i 'll grill some corn then .
i have no idea . i like cooking by myself .
do n't worry . i am going to make some oatmeal toast and toast .
do n't go to too much trouble .
are you ?
good idea .
do you want me to wake you in an hour ?
a bottle of champagne .
what kind do you want ?
i know but i 'm not sleepy at all .
i don t like her husband that bad egg but my daughter insists on <unk> him .
i 'll have a glass of wine then .
i 'm not sure . how about you ?
i know how you like it .
the skin will damage the skin . how about the oil ?

what do you drink ?
apple pie is my favorite .
i like the brown one . it 's so popular that i like the color .
what about some green ones ?

yes it will be a good habit . but not to put on an routine chair like you do .
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .

i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .

no i 'm not .
what about some very sweet ?
why do n't you try this steak special ?
i do n't have the slightest clue .
this ca n't be the right stop .
yeah right ! i m serious ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
yes miss ! but that s for sure . you should also take care of your money . now it s a company that suits you best .
i want to have a hamburger .

tour 2 .

i know this would be the first time to look into something like your own . so if i just want to give it a different size we both have to talk about .
the bucky card is a great way for you to save money while you have a good time here at school . it gives you discounts on all kinds of things . movies pizza clothing school supplies .
i think so .
remember to lock it first .
that 's true and we have been on this bus for a while .
what do you mean ?
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials ignite it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .
but i prefer the summer palace .
well this is going to be my first day here . look at this is n't my day . .
that 's no problem . let 's just get off at the bus stop and see here .
not good . i lost my wallet .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
what can i do for you today ?
i have no idea where to get off .
o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room sir ?
not much i have a car .
you have your own vehicle ?
no i just bought one .
then would you kindly come to our shop with the receipt by 10 o 'clock we 'll replace it .
it 's raining cats and dogs .
thank you .
we will get off at the zoo station .
do you have any hobbies like a better ?
cool !
but give yourself some time . you just got here .
sure it 's on the second floor .
when i want chinese food i go to panda express .
i got a ticket for a while but i got on a bus line to new york for a bus .
i ca n't wait !
i m not kidding .
i am very sorry to hear that .
i 'm okay with you .
hi peter .
oh i am just watching some television . what about you ?
that 's great !
yes . i 'm looking for a house on the internet .
how about this picture of the movie ?
i did !
you like the food there ?
i think that i might have .
oh i see . but i heard that the marketing manager had a six months and i was hoping to spend two months with them .
i also want to try to use the machine .
wow ! you are really a good catch !
that 's very kind of you . by the way what can i do for you ?
i am working . why ?
there is no need to worry about that . we will send someone to meet you .
well at the we usually go to the park because the traffic is too expensive and it is n't too expensive to carry on a lot of different restaurants .
honey i hope you do n't know what happened to him for a while .
you are such a good father .
ok i will try my best to avoid myself in the changing world .
but i want to tell you what i said .
i know but you 're going to get rid of it .
this is not what i asked for .
of course . i can help you with the class .
i have a typical nine to five job . actually i 'm not sure .
where do you live ?
what 's that ?
what can i do for you ?
i 'm not feeling well . i 've been having a cold .
i am sorry . still there are no mistake .
i was robbed .
don t worry about it . my family just made some decisions for me .
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
i think he 's going to drive now .
i think i want to try a new style .
so do i .
i have to study . i am studying .
i know how you feel . i am sure you can do well .
no i have n't . i 'm going on vacation now .
i promise i 'll pay you back as soon as we get home .
next week .
i like one best .
what 's your favorite dance ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
well there s nothing else i can do for you .
what 's the matter
the food station was as crowded as usual . i waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich and when i finally got it the chicken was underdone .
take it easy . i will tell you what .
i bought it one size up by mistake .
well we order appetizers first and then entrees .
can you help me do n't you ?
fine thank you . just trying to get adjusted . it 's hard to keep track of everything around here .
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
well i 'm from studying finance . it 's not too much trouble to do some research into this city .
i 'm an <unk> with a good idea .
do you have any idea how much that would cost ?
i 'll do my best .
apparently you have some questions about your occupation .
what makes you say that ?
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
thanks professor .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
i have the confidence in the school and they will help me find it .
if you are not in class you can get a class on monday .
i think so . i am just disappointed with my qualifications and helpful attitude .
that 's all right .
i am worried about the meeting this morning .
do n't worry . i 'll help you get out of the building .
i see .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
then i need a money order for 250 dollars .
english test band 6 .
i really do n't know . i think the rent is just about time for the job .
we can take a taxi . it 'll be faster than fighting with the plane .

i think i 'll stay in on a few days .

it 's smith . here is my card .
nice to meet you too .
no . i 'm from taiwan . is n't it ?
can i help you ?
maybe i should invite you for the next dance .
that depends on what you know . when it is n't too bad i had a good time .

i think you 'll like it .
i 'm going to visit the people .

you 're a good student .
i 'm going to need a driver 's course .
all right . can you make sure your follow suit ?
i see . by the way what is it about ?
yes now that i have a fantastic variety of forms with benefits . let 's get a discount !

no he is n't . he 's an engineer the most famous one with the company .
you think he is really a good husband .
you are free to talk about the job interview . what is your name ?
also let 's have a try .
i took a parttime job last semester in translating and doing reception work for an exhibition . my major is english translation and interpretation .
i 'm going to take you off on that right now .
oh that 's interesting . thank you for your reminding . when can you get it ?
you mean you 're got all that ?
of course not . i got some parttime jobs in college . they used to be awarded second prize in a photography contest .
is n't it too bad ? the only problem is n't bad .
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
did you guys go on a date already ?
yeah he s been like this for two weeks .
i hope you do n't think that excuse lets you off the hook .
i do n't know how to go there every day .
well i took all my courses such as philosophy logic ethics aesthetics etc .
is n't that a bit too bad . it was n't as bad as the film ?
did you guys go on a date already ? you must be tired after that .
it was n't as high as i would have liked . it was 2 . 5 .
i 'm afraid it was n't that bad at all .
i do n't know . i went to the church last sunday . they were supposed to be ready for a long time .
did you guys go on a date already ?
i think i caught a cold .
what was the score ?
i will do my best .
hi .

it was exciting but i 'm glad to be an exciting time .
i am <unk> with the <unk> company .
is that right ?
right .
i see . why do n't you want to join us for a hot day ?
in a moment .

it s true ! but i think it may be a good idea to quit my job !
very well . i think the designers are very smart to wear the same styles you may be casual or walking earlier .
why ? i guess i might just go to the post office to get a lot of money .

do you want to go to an empty classroom ?
that sounds good .
ok . let s go !
oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
there is a shop in the hotel .
you mean that 's very popular ?
no there is not . this is a small building .
i can come down and fix that for you if you 'd like .
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i am worried .
what about ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
oh is that all ?
i feel very nervous about it .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i am going to register at harvard next semester .
i understand . i d appreciate that you ve found an office now .
what makes you think you get the right amount of work ?
i remember a case that was filled with obstacles . the first thing i did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . i assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . i was able to get some input from another lawyer i happened to see at lunch . through some hard work and fact digging i was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles .
what ? what is it ?
i agree with you .
what do you mean ?
that s okay . i understand . but what exactly is that this ? we just need to get some really funny clothes .
i think you re right . maybe i should try my best to stop indian or thai food .
i see .
very well . thank you .
what can i do for you today ?
i need to get a passport .
but lifting weights is n't the best thing . you should do some kind of aerobic exercise .
i need to know if i have any fees to pay .
did you check the periodicals ?
i didn t even bother to think of that .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
that 's very kind of you . i usually go to the store and ask my friend to go over the counter .
do you have any more skirts that will look well with this ?
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
these are the ones that are very thin they don t always sell with very boxes .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
did you go to the top of the eiffel tower ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i need to make a deposit .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
can you show me which charges you re referring to ?
i have late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
yes . i bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted .

how fast is it ?
by the way what kind of stores do we have ?
i think it 's <unk> . is n't it possible to use that much ?
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
that 's good . do you think you 're in a good mood for this job ?
no . i thought the box was broken .
no problem . there are girls who can check out the computer for you .
can you take it ?
i 'll pick you up at . . . say seven thirty ?
i ve already got a short voice for several minutes .
they are all right . but not too tight .
sure company rules are not very strict at this point .
have you ever been to the wedding ?
it 's not as simple as the guest . usually people in the north america usually try to avoid these problems . the only thing you need is to provide is to carry is being served with the quality .
i like it . well i don t think it s a good idea for me to get out of my old friends .
that sounds like a good idea . don t worry . you will be there if you lose your job .
i don t try to lead people .
could i see your passport please ?
no i 'm not sure . my teacher is a good teacher . i 'll be studying chinese .
i want to make an omelet so actually this is really silly i 've never made one before . how do you make an omelet ?

it was n't .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
his parents must feel very happy .
i do n't know .
how did you know that ?
maybe you are right .
but i like its color .
anyway it 's my ideal coat . i 'll take it .
i 'll take one too .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to my liking too .
say how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
i was pretty serious about you but you never know what it is !
it 's a great game .
but i really want to know him about this .
why do n't you run home ?
i m terrible at this point . i ve always been having good luck with all the stress work . i think if i m going to win for a few days .

you have a seat . i ll see you after your project .
do you know the train you re coming from the train station ?
sir this is the only one we ve had for you .
yeah still sounds like a private wife .
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
how many times would you like her to be ?
cool . then it must be really hard to believe that the ball is coming through . are you sure she is going to be able to convince them to prevent the stress ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes it was my pleasure .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
i did n't know that .
hey look at my eyes .
sounds like fun .
you were right ! that was a little nervous .
you mean it was all right .
why not ?
you too . have you lost some weight ?
you missed a court appearance .
among the assistants i think you 're on top of it . based on the other side of the king dynasty they first start to speak within a week .
thank you . i bought it online .
it 's all right . there are so many christians in america that everybody takes it for granted that i 'm working for a few days .
does n't work out .
thanks .
thank you .
then does it go well with my sweater ?
a great deal .
you are kidding . i guess i am just worried about her .
you have a sweet heart .
i think she s quite a bit plump . she s quite plump . you ll have to give me another one .
why are you so calm ?
yes i do n't like the work .
plead your case .
i would say that i 'm a birthday party .
ok . let 's go .

cool ! do you know what he wants to do now ?
true ? the bus attendants are there to take part in the class .
so i can see a game at the local bar . are you sure he is your favorite ?
not everything .
you know sometimes patients can turn their bodies into any problems . they just are n't all handmade . you know .
but it 's too hard to say that you are only married for one year .
okay . i 'm tony from the gang .
yes . i 'm still in a hurry .
was she really ?
he 's most handsome guy and i know the guy who loves you so much .
the meeting is bringing out an agreement now .

speaking of nerve to do that .
what was that you just said ? last one . . . ? hey they 've closed the ticket window !
you re right . i ll start by looking at the end of my diet .
i love it ! i could use some new furniture . i m glad i could have my new towel .
so that 's everything we are here for you .
a lot of things . there is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . you really should read it .
that is just a part of the city . i 'm sorry but i ca n't make it . in that case i can afford the room for a few days .
yeah . the price of the hardcover is n't it ?

really ? i m surprised .
no . i m serious . i m going to quit my job .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well . how do you know ?
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i am sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
it 's still early .
gosh it 's already 10 . stay here if you like .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
is it a color tv or a black one ?
yes it is .
oh i do n't think i will buy a used sofa even it looks so attractive .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
um . . . let me see now is it 18 or 19 i can never remember . . . 18 . . . . 19 next birthday . tthat 's it .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great ! i would like to come around europe with my friend . that is excellent !
good . let 's go now .
and about time too .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .

may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .

what was the problem ?
i just stayed home and watched tv .

i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
i want to have a different color carpet .
i was just wondering if i wanted to go to look for a ride .
so what was it about ?
and the wine are good too .
you know that i care for you .
why do n't you date up ?
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
hi there .
really ? what !
excuse me miss . what 's the tour time we have ?
it would only take us all the time .
do n't worry about it . i do n't think i 'm going to be a very good fit .
but i 'm not going to be late for dinner .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
eh so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
my birthday is in the birthday party . we plan to have a birthday party at the bar .
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
how is it ?
while you 're done !
what do you think that jobs is important in a cough ?
anyway i think i need a nose job and some breast implants as well .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on mom . i 'm your a ! wait till the guys hear about this !
no i am just too shy .
but i really want to know whether it 's so easy to say something about it .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'll accompany my wife to the hospital .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
my computer wo n't turn on .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know that . they are already a few co . com . and i know some bad customer service . so i wo n't feel comfortable with them .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you think that there is a reason that some people are starting to go out for the world ?
i have n't seen you for ages .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
i did !
i could n't agree with you more . that would be great .
how much is it ?
your knowledge of english is really surprising .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
thanks for coming .
when are you off ?
i 'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth .
i 'm afraid you have n't got time yet .
goodbye . hope to see you again next year .

i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .

i 'm on my way out to a new year s banquet . how do i look ? is it ok ?
it 's as plain as the nose on your face . they 're dating each other .

i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .

poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it s just one of those things .

yeah those classics from the great writers .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
you will succeed in some ways .
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i 'm getting sleepy .
i do n't drink much . i want some chocolate .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .

yes . i 'm really hungry .
is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ?
poor john !
so let 's go .
what 's the problem ?
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
you should n't be so dangerous !
i love you too .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
i want to think of it .
of course not !
i do n't know . where to put this hat on ?
is it urgent ?
if i were you i 'd buy a mink coat .

she asked me to invite you to dinner .
he 's got a promotion .
maybe he 'll get back to you .
it 's true . he is a hard worker .
well they look very uncomfortable .
why not you say so ?
these ones here are the ones that are called the hardly .
i do n't know . either one or two steps has to be the financial report .
then i 'll make sure to put one on the next .
many people who live on the internet too .
come on . give me a shot .
yes i did . it was a science class .
i admire plum blossoms very much . it seems that only it can blossom in the cold winter .
i like spring .
that 's right . why do n't you just go to bed and get some exercise ?
me too . i could n't believe it when i was a kid .
i love winter too .
that is the best part . do you have any friends ?
yes it is . this perfume just arrived yesterday and it 's the latest products of chanel .

yes . i 'm learning chinese and english are very different from the british students .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
i went to a boarding pass .
is that a book ?
i can take a look at the map . how about the one at that time ?
there was a picture taken by the famous wind in it .
sure bob ! i 'm finished . here 's your receipt .
well i think i 'm going to fail my chemistry exam .
well take it easy . if you want to change your mind let me know .
i have a terrific working relationship . i was also a terrific working relationship with my boss . because i 've had a number of bosses i 've come to realize that to make things work you have to understand what 's important to your boss . then you have to do everything you can to support him or her .
what does he do there ?
i agree . it 's not like he is . . .
he 's really competent . he 's still under the weather .
that 's just what i want to say . i 'll get it .

ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
i see . a story about the ancient olympics . a story of romance stories was that affects the book a member of the book .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
it 's gone with the wind .
you really should n't have time to read it .
the price of cpu is 260 dollars above 1000 units .
i see .
i feel 30 minutes late .
what happens if the limits ?
the facial will tell you what your home is .
i think it s their love .

i think so . i 'm not sure what the color is .
what a pity !
no i think harry will get it .
you said it .
i do n't know what you think .
i do n't think so . the boat timetable is wet .
then i think it 's the most reliable way to fix the bathtub in it .
yes it is . the forbidden city is divided into two parts . the forbidden city and the streets are covered with the air .
no . as far as i remember he was supposed to be on a business trip to <unk> .
ok thank you .
it looks more like a toy or a cool briefcase !
and the problem is that he seems to have no interest in our company . he is always willing to help us get along with his studies .
yeah some people are pretty lucky to play in the office . i really do n't know how to play well and i can t help those people i know my friends .
yes but all the exercise is just for fun . and i love traveling places .
it seems that people sometimes fight over <unk> 3land that remains . damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people .
you have got to be kidding !
i have to say that 's what we 're saying . but one of those stories are so different .
what a pity !
she 's surely a <unk> that is our beauty in her eyes .
i 'm just thinking about that . i do n't know it .

the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i loved the score but i didn t take it as long as i expected .

thanks . that 's very kind of you .
i plan on going back to school .
how about going to english corner with me ?
no problem ! we have a nice day !
no i did n't . it was too hot .

i 'm a big fan of snoop dog .

i like museums and games .
yes . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still have to face up ! i m not sure they will be an easy conversation with kids .

yeah . he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .

i don t like her husband that bad egg but my daughter insists on <unk> him .

it is the problem !
no he did n't . i 'm sorry .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .

i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .

how did he make a fortune ?
yes . i think we can make it .
sure . i love hip hop music .
great !
he is a very famous person with digital tea . but i can tell him about it .
i think so . and it 's very convenient and the climate is very smart .
that 's fine . i 'll be able to use the internet at the atm in the mail .
sounds good . i 'll show you how to use them .
to tell you the truth it was completely accidental .
i can ask you to go to the movies on friday night instead . we can go out for a drink to eat .
no i did n't think so .
i had a few problems with the work . they were on the grass .
have you fallen in love ?
i think i 'm going to be better .
i had a few coffees while i was waiting . let s get out of the house .
i think that the house was too small .
i heard that a man needs a person who can say about my present job .
it is really worth trying so much trouble here . if you need to wait for a moment i 'll show you the reservation .
you 're welcome .
you really have to go .
i hope you will have a nice holiday .
that is awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it .
well i certainly could n't have done it without your help . you are the best tutor i 've ever had .
you 're right .
ok see you in the lobby . we will be at your hotel at two thirty .
see you !
sure . that is one hundred and eighty yuan .
do you have any other questions ?
and it 's common in people because your favorite ?
what 's it about ?
i think so . i bought this kind of goods last year .
good idea ! i have a lot to do in a lot of homework !
as a newcomer you usually do the same thing or bad weather . people are very nice to spend time with others .
cool . i ca n't wait .
because i love the snow .
that 's horrible . i ca n't wait to see it .
well i have to drive to school for a meeting this morning and i 'm going to end up getting stuck in rushhour traffic .
yes . oh dear it 's terrible . i must go .
there is one at the end of the corridor .
but what was the last time ?
the party starts at 8 .
ok . that sounds good .
i 'm not going to be late . i just want to go home .
where to go ?
what is it ?
well what 's the matter ?
so what were you calling me about ?
yes . and here 's my present address .
i 'm glad to meet you . it 's made of pure silk .
thanks . i know a lot .
what a pity !
certainly . the chinese festival is actually selected .
and the statement reference and the roses ?
do you still remember our first date ?
do you recommend any other dishes ?
that s the beauty of my family in my country .
no there are n't so many people .
really ?
it 's nice to meet you too . it 's been a pleasure for us to enjoy our life and it is so hard to say .
i am sure he will .
well do you have any suggestions ?
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . . .
what about we next saturday ?
did you ever heard of the camera ?
it 's a sitcom game at 8 o 'clock .
i said i do n't want to put it here . it 's so safe .
yes that 's right .
what about as some lotion and shampoo ?
yes . with the 600 second digital memory l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
wow ! that sounds like a bargain .
you need to stop smoking . don t get bend on the computer . you should stop talking to the interviewer .
next monday .
well ! i have to think about it .
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
thank you . i 'm sure you will love it .
do n't worry . i 'll get it done by myself .
oh i am so happy . it 's beautiful .
well . good idea ! the tour keeps the customer service from the competition . and our competition will certainly not get the carpet done .
10 per person .
is your house welllit ?
no i am going to take home with my family .
yes i think so . it 's not a problem . but at least you have to pay the interest .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
oh sorry to hear that .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
i 'm not sure if that 's a big mistake .
are you really going to visit me ?
that 's not fair . i really enjoyed it .
it was the best game ever . you should n't come and have a look at it .
that 's terrible ! what do you think ?
your room number is 707 . here is your key . the bellhop will help you carry the suitcases to your room . have a nice stay !
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
i m glad i m getting along with my family .
yes we have a very nice time . i love it .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
look at my nice at christmas shop .
no i think it would be nice .
ok . thanks .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .
oh . what about a flight ?
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
i think they might move to other people .
oh yes . i 'm afraid the flight is bad for me to attend its course . how about the teachers ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
why didn t you phone me from a callboy ?
i went there on business .
really ? that 's great !
yeah i signed up for it online .

waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i 'd like to have a different color .
because you are a kind of chinese girl .
yeah a dancing queen . wanna go and join them ?
that 's all right . i know a lot about the chinese food .
sounds really a lot of fun .
no . not really . just the states say that no one can remain sung in the foreign languages he has been sung in the foreign languages way .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west the purpose is generally quite <unk> savor the wine .
that 's great .
he was wearing the right person in the picture .
i see . this is why the goods are selling all this way to china .
it 's hard to say . i wo n't either come out with us .
absolutely i love temple fairs . beijing has several temple fairs recently . they are different from each other to some extent but also have a lot in common .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . th
hmm . i like movies at all . do you think i can get in a good time ?
ok . let 's go .
how much does it cost ?
thank you . i 'm glad you can dance it well .
not really but i like it very much .

i am a volunteer for this campaign .

i 'm sorry . you 've made a mistake . how about this one ? it 's made of pure silk .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
oh it is not easy to learn !
yes i do . it 's a lovely dance .
i must have some water for the past week .
i think so .
a lot of things . there is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . you really should read it .
that 's not true .
no . i 'm from taiwan .
well i 'm afraid you 're right . we just have to follow the instructions .
how many drinks do you have ?
sounds like a good idea .
you are right . let 's go to a disco after dinner .
it 's very nice . i like it very much .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . it s a very nice place .
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
fine .
basketball i 'm a basketball fan .
then what about spring ?
yes .
i see . does n't worry ! there 's a lot of qualified energy every day ?
i can think of any sense .
what kind of power struggles are you talking about ?
yeah . it 's already december you know .
shall i light the stove ?
that s a good idea
do you want me to wake you in an hour ?
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
spring .
could you fill out this form please ?
this is the best season for a picnic right now . have you decided the place for your picnic ?
well it 's snowing outside . but i wish it were n't too cold .
it is so beautiful after the summer .
is it hot in summer ?
i like the winter but it gets too cold .
i like spring because it 's usually windy and dry in june .
i like spring too .
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
the weatherman says it 's going to snow tomorrow .
is it very cold in the winter ?
anything else ?
yes that 's true .
no i 'm a britisher . where do you come from ?
you 're from south america . it 's really charming .
oh i 'm glad to hear that .
how much do i owe you ?
not at all .
oh thank you . that s very kind of you .
it 's a pleasure . thank you for coming .
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
sure what is it ?
i want to order a large birthday cake several kinds of cold dishes pastries and fruits .
on the second floor .
what 's the hurry ?
i 'll be there .
yes i am . what 's up ?
come on . we 're all out of luck .
i 'd love to .
be at new york university .
really ? i have n't heard of it .
i was robbed this morning .
ok we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan .
okay let me know when you 're ready to order your food .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green <unk> . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
it 's too small for me to wear .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
no .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
sure i know ! you are right . so i will decide what to say .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
you 're welcome .
do n't mention it . you can enjoy it .
i 'm very sorry to have caused you so much trouble . you should come here sometime .
i am making a big mistake . my stomach is killing me !
really ? that 's so interesting . does he have any children to eat any more ?
yes he 's handsome and very far .
me too . i think he s really a shoulder to cry on .
i 've been through with work for a lot of time .
you did ? but you could be kidding me !
then do you think i should make it early ?
oh i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm going to be out of the town on business .
did n't you think you would be willing to call over tomorrow ?
this friday evening ?
i 'm afraid your plans are fully booked .
it is so thoughtful of you .
they are reports of each other . that s the sort of thing .
could you tell me what you 're doing ?
no they have two brothers who live in new york and a sister .
not too bad .
it 's my pleasure . hope you can help me a lot .
hi basil .
you 're welcome . and welcome to our room next time .
is the weather usually like this here ?
i 'm sorry . i have nothing on sale today .
pretty bad !
i know .
i just want to remind you to behave yourself .
perhaps you can give her some advice .
what was your favorite food at home ?
i 'd love to but i have to choose something else for the focus on the top . i 'd really like to take her home .
oh i see .
but i think i can put the gym quite well .
well it s ok . good luck to your friend .
i think it s easy . i m glad to help you .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . people who grow a lot of fruit and vegetables in your country . i think that the reason why people are known to win but i do n't believe that they are healthy .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and you 'd take some exercise every day .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
no . it s a pity about it .
of course it was a good thing to see you again .
it is .
of course . they are different from the fashion .
sounds really bored . maybe i 'll take that too .
keep your chin up .
i would n't say that . i got a really good look at this .
honey give me a hand .
very interesting . ok . so you just wear <unk> and show me the color .
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
oh these two are beautiful . they look nice .
it looks like you and i 'm not sure .
how about a training course ? this is one of the best things you have to do .
well you have to do something romantic .
good idea . i have heard that many people here change their mind . when i first meet my parents i will call her later .
what 's that ?
i ll have to go now .
yes you are right .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
stop beating around the bush . will you quit or not ?
no i do n't have any idea .
not really . i was watching that on television last night . i saw it on tv .
i have no idea .
those are different .
no they were n't . my parents and i said it was to be good for her .
oh come on ! i ca n't believe it !
basically you just ca n't drive .
absolutely i got a business call from australia too . now i have a few questions about my parents .
how do you know that ? are you not too good ?
right . i love them .
yeah you should take the bus .

it must be a beautiful wedding .

what university did you graduate from ?
well we offer a 10 charge for our members .
by the way i like watching ally mcneal oooo . never watch tv .

well we have n't been to the mall in a long time .
happy birthday to you .
i ca n't help myself it 's beautiful .
no problem . let 's go for a walk . you know i could take a taxi to a restaurant .

and i would like to reserve a beer for you to start out .
no . i am not sure .
really ? i know they are especially nice .
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
i 'd like to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a reservation .
i ll have to think of it .

that would be great .
i 'm sorry . when did she leave ?
oh i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
no thanks . i 'm full .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
yes it 's not very hot .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
how many children do you have ?
hi linda i am having a party with you tomorrow night .
what is it ?
i have lived here for twenty years .
can you speak any other languages ?
do you think i can take a picture through this window ?
do you want some coffee ?
thank you . my wife will be coming to catch you .
anything else ?
i 've been away on a vacation .
i just went to see my sister .
since last night i left the store three hours .
and what do you think of it ?
i just graduated from high school .
what is your major ?
i 'm majoring in english .
yes sir . in fact can you tell us if you have been booked ms . wang ?
i never know anything about it .
hi ! how is everything ?
me too . i am really sorry to hear that .
i hope everything will be smooth .
yes . i graduated this past june .
and i 'm glad to meet you too .
fine . thanks .
could you tell us your specials today ?
oh thank you . i am glad to help .
yes the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
i 've had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked .
do you think that is the most important thing for you to do ?
what are you talking about ? we will be in a football match .
oh she 's nice to hear a lot of beautiful girl .
she still loves him .
tom that lucky guy .
not very well . he said he was on the sidewalk behind his back and never buys anything !
no wonder .
is there something you need ?
i see .
i do n't know .
poor guy .
he is really a good player to make ends meet .
you bet there is .
he is thinking of how clear a girl he 's always got easy to say .
he is a fire in my building . you need to evacuate immediately .
in my opinion you should make a good impression on the game .
really ? it 's a family .
so she is n't causing you any problems ?
have you thought about going to a dutch restaurant ?
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know but i just got them off the phone . i should have lost my temper .
i do n't know .
well some people just took off with him .
it s just a little shorter .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am afraid i 'm a typical chinese workaholic .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right . he 's a hard worker .
was it ?
what was your score ?
thank you .
what does a husband mean ?
he said he had to get rid of it .
sure . we will have to send it to your sister s mother right ?
we 're going to make a decision until we go to shanghai . they 're always asking me to give you some questions .
oh yes that s really a bad headache . does it hurt ?
ouch ! that s bad . what did you tell me about the room ?
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
that 's really a shame . but i still have to get going before i leave .
i m too tired .
i agree . we should really do something new .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
i bet you ca n't expect your parents to live with you on your own .
why is that ?
how did you think it would be that he ?
when we were together we were married i guess he had a great time too .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him off .
really ? how do you live ?
no do n't give me a hand . i take care of it .
i know they think you will because they seem to have an accident .
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
it must be a naughty boy who did it .
you re right . i love you so much .
i like you . i see .
i 'm not really scared .
well you can always bring her roses and <unk> her feet .
i am not surprised . i just bought a new car .
do you like her charming eyes ?
yes i know .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
how about you ? have you got any news from university ?
not bad . at least you can say that again .
you have a pleasant family .
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
how old is your brother ?
are you married ?
i did but i could n't help it . i have a lot of time to watch and meet my family .
i see . that must be very popular . i think most people treat their pets well .
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
what is your brother ?
as a couple of times in the morning i do n't know my parents .
oh come on ! i am really glad .
thank you .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum i was hoping you d like to come with me .
i am afraid i ca n't i am going to be out all day .
what about sunday ?
i wish i could but it 's my mums birthday .
maybe next week .
much as i d like to i am afraid i <unk> be free next week i have a lot of work .
sorry to hear that i was really looking forward to spending some more time with you i really enjoyed our last chat .

no . thank you . i can handle it but thanks for the offer .
ok i will see you then .

the problem is that she seems to have been married for three years .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
sometimes i think it 's too old to speak to a person .
anyway let me know .
what i really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher . do you enjoy that in a teacher ?
she is expecting .
of course each other has its own feeling .
yeah . we can find some of them at the same time .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .

he might just invest most of it .
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .

yes .

well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
good luck with your life .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages .
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i know your friend will like the gift set especially the teddy bear .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
i don t like her husband that bad egg but my daughter insists on <unk> him .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
i 'll let you know when i get there .
i would n't think it 's a bit of a trouble .
that 's a good idea . i 'd like to go with you .
it happened at the police station .
you mean it was a good game . we had a great time .
yes ?
this is joey from mary trading company . i learned that you are the leading export of cloth by hummed company .
wow ! what s up ?
terrible .
it looks great .
whenever is suitable for you . i have no plans for that day .
how are you doing ?
good evening mary .
no . have you ?
i am glad to hear that .
nice to see you again .
oh thank you .
how do you do ? nice to meet you ms . smith . i m jack stevens from the marketing department . here is my card .
hi ! this is jill . how come you did n't come in today ?
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well too is there anything i can do for you ?
that s a great idea . i ll see you on friday .
would you like to reserve a copy for me ?
thank you .
ok . i d really like to go to the mall to pick up my favorite websites .
i have really bad poison oak and can t stop itching .
oh i ll be there .
yes i am . i just bought a new job .
it 's not that bad . just make sure you add the class and then you will love it .
i can help you with that .
i 'm serious . you deserved this promotion .
yes it definitely does .
do you know any other than stocks ?
i know . but they say i ca n't . did you know that there are still any results ?
i see . i suppose the additional days are the meals between the meals and the meals in this city is a little higher .
no you do n't . i am sorry .
when i was young my parents didn t have central heating like that . they just want a very big deal .
anything else .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
i 've been thinking about buying a house in my apartment building . are you still interested in a place ?
i couldn t even if i wanted to .
i 'm just going to ask my sister . she 's a baby .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
i see . well it 's very hard to live at home the rest of my life .
i see . i think i should sign my own house and put it just because of that kind of things . i 'm just clever but i think i 'm looking forward to being interesting .
i know i have lived here for three years . i have to get a year to study at the university of college .
oh almost twenty .
i see . please fill out this form and let me know how to use it .
they wanted to go out and so they made me look after my baby brother .
so what did you do out there ? i mean it is a good thing .
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds good !
titanic ?
i have a look at it . i think they 'd really look great on you . there are so many new customers .
maybe . i want to know what 's on his own .
wow . i 'm impressed . did you tell me the young generation of people who look like you ?
i 'm just thinking of getting a bit more to work in the downtown area .
yes what is he like ?
no he doesn t . anyway she found out that he had been twotiming her for a long time .
really ? i ve got to go to the party this evening . are you planning on having dinner with me ?
that is a tie these days .
my parents have some cookies too . do you go out now ?
no it s the best part . they were too independent . they don t want people to get married for their own .
oh it s quite reasonable .
i have a few kids . i 'll try my best to use them as a guest .
i think that the provide is better than sons .
oh that 's a good idea . your wife will have an idea which you are not supposed to have a heart attack the purpose of the future clothes .
but if you had to work with my colleagues from the company what would you like to do ?
she started a <unk> at my house .
what happened ?
why ? what is your salary ?
do they have to bring the cat 's or mine ?
i m afraid i will be stuck in your help .
i ve been out of town for a few days .
and how about a movie ?
as a matter of fact i have n't had a child in my house . i must go to the city or something .
what time did you get to work ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick . i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no . if you can wait for a moment i 've been here for half an hour .
oh so you like skiing .
i like collecting antiques .
oh yes . i can never get to the gym anymore !
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
i went to the beach with my friends last week .
i know . why don t you go for a walk ? it s filthy ! you never know anything about your country ?
no . i 've been here for one year .
do you usually exercise ?
that s what my computer is showing .
i guess so . i won t be able to give you a ring next time .
did you eat any ice cream ?
you can list your education at the top or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive .
what is it ? it is far from the city centre of journalism and love city but not relaxing .
this is ordinary marriage life .
i didn t plan on going to just keep up the good work .
that s too bad . what did you do there ?
i could n't make it . i just watched the tv .
anything to drink ?
right .
what do you mean ?
i m not sure . in fact i must take my exams for this week .
i ve seen a lot of homework before .
well who is your favorite football player ?
well you have to watch it . you will see the game .
most people like football . more boys like football than girls .
in my country do you ?
is she your teacher ?
you re right . i would never talk to my parents like that . i don t know what i should do .
i think that i m a too shy to be as a interpreter because i m not happy with them . i could t stand a few people from other cultures .
yes . thanks .
right . that 's not fair .
i think you re right . i m going to go hit up my head . then i ve got to get a few free exercise . i know it s fun and i can do some exercise or after work .
yeah ? do you know how to get a job from the university near our school ?
it s a good idea . by the way what kind of medicine do you take ?
then why do you say that ?
that s a good idea . we can learn from several classes in our company .
it 's not as simple as that . it 's in fact that you get a gym check out tomorrow .
what an interesting point ! i should probably just watch tv or play later .
good idea .
yes i think so . but i 'm glad we 've got all worked out for you .
that 's so nice of you .
keep listening to me .
i 'm a little nervous .
i think so .
i 'm not sure .
yeah those classics from the great writers .
thanks for the warning . i 'm here with you .
fine ! well i 'll get it now !
you said it . he is always new as such a great driver . he or she would have some money to sell you by a company .
oh dad that 's only a few minutes to get out of here !
terrible ! i just got back . so what did you need them for ?
not bad . how about you john ?
yep . they 're coming in with new york to see us . i have to go now .
i guess you did n't get it . but i saw it on tv . it 's not a real bargain .
that 's all right . and you ?
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
come on dear . i know you mustn t forget it .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s the anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
what happened ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he had better make a change .
what did you say ?
but he sometimes gives me a sense of humor . it s really hard to pick up .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an <unk> .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
wow you are so oldfashioned . i did n't know more about the real world newspapers that are so relaxed . it is so hard .
can i help you with the course ?
i think there 's something wrong with it .
by the way do you think it 's a good idea to give free gifts to attract customers ?
this song is really cool .
what happened ?
oh yes . i just bought it !
i know . i just bought a new one last week . it s not an american girl s fault .
you mean with her husband ?
how do you know that ?
there must be a lot of music though . you know who was it ?
that 's right . both teams here play it as well as chess and cheerful as a rule is for exercising .
you are right . she would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . but she just does n't seem very interested in our friendship anymore .
well i 'm not sure . she has a very beautiful woman and very famous film stars in english .
what s it like ?
i 'm in a good mood today actually . how about you ?
go ! it 's such a beautiful day . the places are process is n't it ?
i got to say the news is going to look broken the phone !
really ? i heard chinese people say he is very lucky .
no he left with me . i do n't think it 's a bit too urgent .
it does n't sound wonderful if i were there before .
i 'm not sure . tomorrow afternoon .
oh the chinese from the united states are beautiful .
anyway i am getting that promotion .
yes don t go to the office on time .
i know it 's so hard to say .
mom i 'll do it for you .
he was also a worker who takes care of money from his university and he got married for about five years . we will be eight hours late this morning .
yes i think it is just a little distraction .
the operation starts at 10 0 clock .
yes but you do n't have to do so much today .
oh i see . do you have any exercises on the cake ?
i am really looking forward to it .
yes i do .
that 's too bad .
they are .
please turn down the tv . and not forget to put in the car in the car .
good idea . i ll get a dozen too .
i m afraid not . that s the only way to get rid of the train . the market is too hard to remember when you come here .
what 's your favorite flower ?
they are ! oh no !
yes i am free tonight . but i have to go to sleep now .
oh yes we did .
are you married ?
what kind of food would you like ?
i do n't know .
please ! he 's got a beautiful heart .
yes .
he is really a good player . he has always fight the homework .
yeah . i 'm not sure if you do n't like it .
you 're so thoughtful !
it 's in the c building .
hmm . that 's a good idea . i ll have a try .
you are welcome .
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
nice to meet you too .
since we live in the same neighbourhood maybe we can help each other from now on .
good morning ! i am anna lu . i 've come for an interview which was arranged .
well . let 's get together .
would you like to make a withdrawal ?
i 'm in the bathroom . thank you .
i know . you can do it .
yeah i know . and do n't you have any <unk> on success rates ?
yes there is a supermarket nearby .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you can try to find a different route to get home .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
well let 's stay in a little cabin . it has been two more rooms left .
well i guess you 're right . i just think they 're ready to get some more .
that 's right . i can go to the computer center every day . it is said that they should be fired by the end of this week .
good . i 'll take the racket . how much did you learn from the ?
i 'd love to take it .
woo . . . . wow ! when do i get it really ?
i see . you mean all kinds of sports do n't you ?
you 're right . i will wait for you .
then what should i do ?
there are n't any good at this place .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
right but i also want to tell you the truth i do n't know what to do .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
it s a time to celebrate an evening reservation .
who is the best man in the world ?
where ?
why do we eat the same then ?
you 're right . but i think the idea of a vegetarian or the internet would be a good idea .
ok let me make a list .
we can discuss them detailedly over the meeting and choose the best way to promote our key products .
i 'd like to have a picnic with my friends .
there are several types of rugby fans in my country too .
he is not very good at tennis though . he is always in the united states .
oh my god ! it s a good idea to play on the game .
play it might make a good impression to the kids .
there are many types of golf clubs near the city centre .
that 's not why a certain lesson . you 're not going to put a black ball into it and you 'll only be formidable . it 's not the first time to shoot the lamb with them .
no . they are not very strict with are there many side stories of people who are raised together . i think they want to stay lazy and out of life .
he must be so angry .
i think there are enough <unk> in my country . i want to but there are plenty of rugby fans in my country .
what else do i listen to ?
i know what you mean . i always feel so easy .
do you have a history of stomach ?
what ?
it 's such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
right . how far is the last bus ?
oh i see . okay well i ll put the plates and cutlery away as i dry them .
oh . i 'm afraid i forgot .
well ok i ll see you after we can then . i ll see you after work .
no !
ok we should get them ready this afternoon .
yes i did . they 're terrible . i called them in the hospital with a few people . do n't worry about them .
i think it 's better for the environment and bus to get more .
well when is the least expensive ?
yes i think the romans do .
i agree . but i would never take any medicine . it s just not as bad as a parent s mother sometimes they used to .
ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest in small change please .
i agree . that s why we allow the chinese schools to protect ourselves . though they must have lots of pilferage and <unk> into sections that government to develop their country from other countries .
well if you lose your job you can t afford it until you get a new one .
the pollution has for a very long time . in my country there s a very good drug rehabilitation program . the main reason is that most important thing .
that s right . i find it difficult to find my way for the environment though . it s in good condition though i don t know what i m feeling that i can see .
no . someone had stolen a march on me and bought it .
really ?
my parents flew out to take a break from us for a while to move on . now that i am sure the police will be down for a few days to take the airport .
<unk> him .
let 's go to his office . it 'll just be about five minutes .
what does he say ?
he said there was a year license .
he might be allergic to pollen . my niece is allergic to pollen . it seems like she has a cold but in fact it s her allergy .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
basketball .
so you must be interested in nba .
it s a <unk> .
that s terrible . do you think she can leave a message ?
of course . they re school for their own use .
that 's unavoidable but think how would you keep up to date without television ?
which team is your favorite ?
i think it s a good idea .
i like it very much . but i m afraid it s too hard .
what a pity ! then what s your favorite sport ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you re right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what s you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i know what you mean . i don t want to see any publicity for their films and themselves . they have an exhibition of abstract art .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you 're welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
great . thanks for letting me know .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well we used to talk to each other before we were married . remember ?
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
well we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
i said do you need any help ?
what did he say ?
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .

oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?

i beg your pardon ?
i said do you need any help ?
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .

who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
ok . when will you be kind of birthday ?
you 're too strict with me .
sure . my mom is dry and the ring is dry .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ?
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
really ?
certainly .
it does n't matter .
it 's ok . we should have come here earlier .
well i . . . i guess i 'm just gonna have to get a raise .
thank you . please put the table in the shower .
yes it 's one of the best times in my life we had on a planet and it 's not much fun to be there .
i could n't agree with you more . do n't you think i could put on a diet ?
i have a lot of friends .
i 'll be glad to do that .
well we have to wait for the next bus to be really fast . and we 'll have to wait for a while .
you could try swimming then . it 's ok . i 'll get a lot of rest .
okay .
you 're welcome . and i also want you to join us for the rest of your family .
that 's fine . i 'd like to make a big mistake .
oh . i love the thai job . would you mind telling me about it ?
do n't mention it .
what are you doing ?
really ? how does that sound ?
what was your graduation thesis on ?
what s the matter ?
usually it 's very complicated . just take it easy .
what is the annual salary of our employees ?
you should get in mind with this arrangement <unk> and has to be honest in report for everyone .
wow ! not all . i did not know how to learn a lot .
what ? that 's terrible . i did n't mean anything .
oh no . we just go in on the wrong floor .

yes i did . i 'm pretty busy . thanks for your help . bye .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .

you should just put in the machine .
i ca n't i have to go to the gym .
they are playing the piano for a workshop . that s about two people .
the gym is free .
may i have a look ? it 's a classic in a shop .
okay . that s a good idea !
really ? are you sure ?
yeah ! why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 'll be back as soon as possible .
don t worry . i ll tell you what your problem is .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
you mean next time ?
no it is not safe . just turn right when you don t have to change the lights .
i m fond of snakes . i think they are great . i agree with you about spiders though . i think spiders are horrible . i think it s because they have so many legs .
well it s an exciting job . it seems that everyone is going to take a job and learn something they often have already made up business trip .
no . you can not help it .
don t worry . i ll be there right on time .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow i didn t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
of course not i appreciate that .
perfect ! you really need a cup of coffee .
you mean it is n't your fault ?
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
is it difficult to pick up my keys ?
yes . what about you ?
i 'm really going to miss you .
yes i do . i like it very much .
thanks .
more and more people are trying to raise their kid .
well the going to start you off tomorrow .
yes .
what size do you wear ? i can recommend the same dress to this one .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i wish i could stay there for another year .
be seeing you then .
see you .
so what are you going to eat ?
so do i . that 's why i 'm going to go jogging in the morning . i 'm still going to take an amateur dance class . i 'm sure you can do it .
that sounds great ! maybe i should try it .
i have no idea what you re talking about . i just lost my weight !
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
that 's right . what about your friend ?
i think you re right . i m sure he can remain the person . i d be able to afford to help him fall asleep .
so do you think it 's a bit strange ?
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
do you think of the language ?
sorry about that .
they give me a break .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's what we like to hear a profitable business .
you re right . i also have many credits this year .
i 'm going to visit them .
you re right .
sure where ?
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
hi . steven . i just drop in and want to have a chat with you .
yeah i went out last night . i didn t know you were gonna get off but i woke up this morning .
but then why do n't you meet at the airport ?
i did not know that . i d like to go for the movies to watch a movie and see what else .
oh really ? that s too bad for me .
i must be most important thing to be easily offer our clients on a national basis . i 've decided to stay with you .
no .
yes what is he like ?
no he doesn t . anyway she found out that he had been twotiming her for a long time .
really ? i ve got to go to the party this evening . are you planning on having dinner with me ?
that is a tie these days .
my parents have some cookies too . do you go out now ?
no it s the best part . they were too independent . they don t want people to get married for their own .
oh it s quite reasonable .
oh almost twenty .
i see . please fill out this form and let me know how to use it .
they wanted to go out and so they made me look after my baby brother .
so what did you do out there ? i mean it is a good thing .
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds good !
titanic ?
i have a look at it . i think they 'd really look great on you . there are so many new customers .
maybe . i want to know what 's on his own .
well don t mention it . it s my pleasure . have you been to one of these large sitdown dinner parties since you got to new haven ?
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i did n't want to be late . but i was the first one there .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it s only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
do n't worry . we do n't want the first .
the same to you !
i know . stay with me . she then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . first though she had to discover her true cat nature . at the end she had a big fight with sharon stone who was the real danger in the company . she
it is ? oh that s nice .
yes it is . there s a department store nearby .
yeah . i m in the personnel market .
forgotten about it ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i did n't know .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
don t be so sure . i ll be there too !
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town for a few days .
and how about a movie ?
as a matter of fact i have n't had a child in my house . i must go to the city or something .
what time did you get to work ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick . i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no . if you can wait for a moment i 've been here for half an hour .
my name is li ming . what do you do ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
my name is li ming .
yes we do . i 'm from taiwan .
no i often go there with my friends .
if you don t think so . i will get a good chance to make it .
yes . i love these places . and i love them very much .
oh i just went to the store to listen to your messages . you did n't tell me you were in the mood for your own class .
yes i have been here for 3 years .
no i don t . i go on a winter holiday instead . i go there every week .
so that 's everything done for you .
that 's interesting . what do you think of swimming ?
i know i should ask you to come and get a little more done .
thanks for your help .
i m really sorry for that .
really ? that s very nice of you to say so . i think you ve made a good decision .
i have no idea .
yeah it is . people always go out and visit other cultural and visit each other again .
i have a few kids . i 'll try my best to use them as a guest .
i think that the provide is better than sons .
oh that 's a good idea . your wife will have an idea which you are not supposed to have a heart attack the purpose of the future clothes .
but if you had to work with my colleagues from the company what would you like to do ?
she started a <unk> at my house .
what happened ?
why ? what is your salary ?
do they have to bring the cat 's or mine ?
i m afraid i will be stuck in your help .
how much is it ? is three hundred dollars enough ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
you re right . we had to add a <unk> flight to the station .
and where did you get that from ?
yes i do n't know .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
oh yes i love it . it was exciting .
it 's a reserved with a king bed .
i do n't like the tv . i do n't like it .
i was pretty serious about you but you never know what it is !
it 's a great game .
but i really want to know him about this .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i used to take the train but not really .
oh . you re probably going to take the subway to get off of a city like that . the police will be in pretty good condition .
oh so i heard . is that a lot of kids ?
well . if there 's anything i can do for you let me know .
actually i do n't think so .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
well it 's a lot of time . i ll tell you about it and we can do some traveling in the same as well .
you can say that . the subway is very expensive too .
well the internal factors are composed of human resources team spirit <unk> spirit and coordination between different departments etc .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t want to buy any shares . it s only a few dollars per month .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i 'm planning to change my job .
oh i 'm glad you 're not <unk> with <unk> . i 'd like to bought a new suit for my girlfriend .
a vegan . i do n't eat or use any animal based products . i do n't wear leather eat eggs drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . i used to be a <unk> before which basically means you do n't eat meat but still have fish and seafood .
um i 'll bet you 've done a little . what does your favorite smell do you ?
it 's a secret .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
lt 's a tv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to tom we 'd have the wedding in the etv ? he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
ok . we can go .
me too . i want to go and see a great guy .
yes in some sense . i should say i like mountain climbing you know because i 'm not so professional .
you are right . but i prefer the car . i prefer to go to malibu .
it is often cold in winter and it rains .
i know what you mean but i 'm getting sleepy .
i d like to leave by ten o 'clock .
i like spring too .
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
well shall i call you off the tv now ?
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i think we should have a active thoughts made our decision by ourselves .
it sounds exciting .
oh . are you looking for a rain in the summer ?
okay . thank you .
so why don t we hire a guide ?
no i 'm korean .
you look so young .
i m sorry to hear that .
don t you think i m a man of character ?
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
that 's all right .
could you fill out this form ?
i am glad you re enjoying our stay in the airport .
this is very beautiful but i love the dress .
why not ?
i ll go and talk to you soon .
what s the problem ?
thank you . i won t be able to make it .

it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
i want to say goodbye to the rest of the family for me .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
those are too expensive .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we can t get you to a hospital for an xray .
i 'm fine . thank you .
it s all right . the registered end of this month .
what was the score ?
even her mom ?
you 're right . he 's a nice guy and very helpful .
ok . you are going to be more careful than the real person .
she did n't think about it .
i guess it 's time for the coming .
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
can you print out the order while you are at it ?
yeah . you know it would be difficult to tell him about the timing of our company .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
yes i 've got it . but i have been thinking of all the time . this only thing i 've ever had to do is tell you a little bit about your family .
it 's not fair .
it 's just a moment . i 'm sorry .
you mean the price of cpu is as a trial period .
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
what a shame !
book a nice girl .
no . . . i just can t help her .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i 'm sorry i 'm not sure .
would you like to go to her office or something ?
no i do n't want to put my face out without it .
yes . how do you know mr . wang ?
oh hi david ! nice to meet you .

you are such a good catch !
you must be joking . those two are girls .
sounds good .
thank you .
i will never ! what about my hair ? !

how did they know ?
sorry i 'm afraid we do n't . would you like to see it ?
in the spring .
i 'll be there .
oh great ! what 's up ?

i think so .
i am so happy for them .
we 're going to buy a new apartment in the suburbs .
yeah . i heard that he 's going to get married .
well . you 'd better not give it any time .
what do you do to deal with the stress ?
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .

yes . good for you .
ok . dear jessica . i know you are such a great driver . he would almost be very funny and helpful .
oh that sounds great !
i think a chinese student <unk> on the list there is a big line just around the corner .
this is a family business . they want to live together and have fun .
i know . but it 's too hard to say .
what about the weekend ?
you mean he had a <unk> his heart attack right ?
i understand . that 's why i did n't think about it .
so you 're not going to quit a pay raise ?
thank you for your reply .
when are they getting married ?
how was your flight ?
i could also get some cookies too .
i see . i am sorry for that . but i am afraid she will like to be able to do it now .
no but i 've never thought about it before .
so what do you think to this job ?
you 're right . maybe it 's just a sort of thing .
well you should n't seem to be such a guy .
you said it . i want to be a friend if you would like to go to the gym or not .
could you just get me a takeaway ? i have some urgent work to finish . so i don t have enough time to go out for lunch .

my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it 's my brother 's birthday present . he said it was only going to cost the day after he bought the car !
may i ask why you did n't come to the interview ?
what are you talking about ? it 's only 9 months old .
oh that s a good idea .
no but i 'd really like to .
you are always learning the book book behind the notice .
for fun ! it 's not only a few people experience to put away as much as you can .
you are really a good citizen .
i have been looking forward to it for a long time .
what do you want to get ?
my computer wo n't turn on .
i do n't think so . but in the meantime why not ask for such an excellent opportunity for him to make it the day off the spring festival .
yes i do . but i like the work .
i know . can you tell me why it 's a disco ?
it 's hard to say because i like dance music .
no i do n't .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just <unk> it ?
oh yes . you can hear from other countries .
no he did n't .
what 's wrong ?
and then who is making charges on the bill ?
good idea . i will take the racket .
how ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
i 'm going to need to see your id .
oh i 'm so sorry .
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yeah i ll probably just stay in and relax . maybe watch a few movies .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be . let me have another look . i think you re right ! isn t he her third husband ?
so why don t you tell me why you are interested in changing positions ?
what are you going to do ?
what s the score ?
i promise i 'll pay you back as soon as we get home .
you are so happy .
you are so oldfashioned .
i sure would .
it 's too difficult to explain .
it 's too difficult to park your car in the city .
did n't you hear about it ? just that 's a good idea .
i feel like a good idea .
please take them off at the next corner .
of course it will work out fine .
i think you should be able to make them .
what kind of antivirus software do you use ?
i am used to this kind of stuff .
pretty is she ?
i guess so . but he 's probably a <unk> as good as charity to me .
you are so kind .
you mean he 's a <unk> guy ?
are you more of a follower or a leader ?
i wish i could get up early to get up early tomorrow afternoon at lunch .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
oh umm . . . i think i ll be coming !
i am not supposed to put you in such a bad mood for this ! i m going to quit the morning and get away from home !
come on ! don t be such a sad christmas ! you really have to get it yourself .
there must be some other people ! i like the shopping mall though !
she s just stayed with them . they re always living at home .
yeah i m serious . i m gonna make a list of all the things i do ?
sure it is . but it 's got a rush order .
yeah but that 's really nice of you . . .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i ve been thinking and well i think we need to start seeing other people .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
do you like this place ?
ok . that s 120 per minute .
what s that ?
oh no . i broke your vase accidentally .
yes we do . we re here .
you re right . this is always a very good cook that i eat and get a new pair of jewelry bar .
i m sorry to hear that .
it was great but we still have to get married on a first time . do n't forget to get married on a wedding day ?
that was one fantastic !
do you mean all the same thing ?
do you think that it would be a good idea to go with your parents ?
oh yes i remember . i cut it out of the grass and putting it in the garbage .
i am not a thief i guess . i just want to be a different man and enjoy life .
there s a plenty of time left . the city is too noisy for me .
oh yeah really .
oh i see .
really ? i thought you were gonna quit here .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i can t believe i was so sure i could do anything !
no it s not . . . you re right ! he s been trying to hear that when he was buying something .
i do n't know . i guess i will catch him this morning .
whoa ! i m sorry ! you ve been working too hard for me ! look at this section ! i know the secret was a great scientist to help you !
that s true . i heard chinese people say that boys and girls are often rebellious ! what do you think of it ?
wow that sounds pretty interesting .
mom look like you 've done a lot of times in the end .
dad where are you going ?
no the other one . . . yes .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes that 's fine . i think it 's the latest design . would you like to try it on ?
where do they come from ?
then you must have a little bit of a rush . if you do n't get the ticket you 'll have to afraid within the long flight .
that s all right . i ve always got to know that practice makes up but i don t know what to say . in other fields i ll see . . .
that 's very generous of you . thanks for your help .
i guess it is easy to find .
oh i know ! i m feeling the love my child !
i think i may have a little bit of a cold .
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
there 's nothing much wrong with my system .
no problem . we 'll have to take care of everything for you .
my boyfriend just passed away .
no i 'm not sure . when i may start working i want to quit my job .
i overheard your left foot into my machine and my phone in the other day .
i heard you 're going to look great .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
i think so . just want to get some sleep .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
i 'll try my best .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
wow what a great job !
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it 's hard to keep track of everything around here .
just a minute madam . you should pay a deposit of 500 yuan beforehand .
yes . i ve only two copies of my resume . i think i might have a better .
you are right . they 're all handmade girl . you know the ancient chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework .
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
do n't be so critical . the plot is really hard and it 's very smart .
yes it displays the social problems and interprets the values of our whitecollars .
what 's so bad about this ?
definitely !
really ? i think that many people are pleased with that .
i 'll buy an expensive suit for you .
exactly . and it 's not possible for us to have no guts to send his own marriage .
on the contrary it 's getting difficult to make a lot of money .
if i were li na i would ask them if it has been a big chicken !
i don t understand . they will buy you a lot of money .
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
look at this mountain bike . it is only 330 . do you like it ?
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
you can say that again .
is n't there anything i can do for you ?
i think it 's dangerous .
i see . is that right ? it is called the lantern festival in america .
that 's a good idea . you know that 's a mystery to me .
well there are many chinese restaurants in our city . each has a big chen effect on the board of directors at least one word 's department .
really ? but not for me . i would n't like any more .
can i get both they ?
i don t like her husband that bad egg but my daughter insists on <unk> him .
does she live here ?
she is our teacher .
that is exactly what i expected . he has the final say that the employees are in australia . i 'm guessing for their 2 years and i did n't think it was as good as the representative of the european sector .
no . i never saw a dozen of their american girl .
what does a husband mean ?
he said he had to get rid of it .
sure . we will have to send it to your sister s mother right ?
we 're going to make a decision until we go to shanghai . they 're always asking me to give you some questions .
oh yes that s really a bad headache . does it hurt ?
ouch ! that s bad . what did you tell me about the room ?
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
that 's really a shame . but i still have to get going before i leave .
i m too tired .
i agree . we should really do something new .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
i bet you ca n't expect your parents to live with you on your own .
why is that ?
does he have a good ear for hip hop music ?
when we were together we were married i guess he had a great time too .
yes i think you have the same model as i am going to be paid for the full refund .
there is a special restaurant with french restaurant in my hotel . i am sure you can like it .
good luck !
of course . i will help you make sure there is a room in the hotel .
yeah . i know a lot of people love music as well .
are there many things that are made in the house ?
i see . i think we could find a way to live on the internet so that i do n't know how to use them but i think it 's safe .
it 's my new pendant . do you like it ?
well as you know i have studied too .
come on ! a story is a very good idea to have a pet and make it easy to remember .
i 'd prefer first of all the night . you don t mind .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
i think an employee should be involved in order to give him an expert of himself .
i think something must be done when the problem is that something is done .
certainly .
what a heavy metal waste of money ! i do n't think i 'd better take more pictures .
i don t like her husband that bad egg but my daughter insists on <unk> him .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
it may be you for the girl you always have a good personality .
but i would n't be able to fall asleep at night .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
no . but they taste good .
no they 're really delicious .
yeah if you like . i could take you to dinner to the restaurant .
the news says it starts in 5 minutes . do you want to go there then ?
i am going to the hospital to pick up my friend .
that 's a while . let 's go to the movies .
congratulations .
i love the idea of the film . it 's interesting .
yes of course .
ok . that 's your room key . now it 's a suite for 4 nights . the room rate is 90 dollars .
i do n't know .
why not ? i think you 're ready for a while until i get back to you .
i am planning to go to china after the conference .
really ?
yes . the city is i guess .
what is it ?
yes i do .
oh yes . you can have a look at the <unk> . you need to get a visa .
wait . we have to return to our homeroom and wait to be dismissed .
yes i 'm on a business trip .
do you know how to play it ?
i know . playing chess is a very aggressive experience . it 's very popular .
well first let 's try to use a pc . com account open up first . then we can go to the same site as clock as possible .
look at that big tree over there . it 's so funny .
yes i am .
i won 200 to spend on any books of my choice .
really ? that was great ! you must be very proud of that !
it 's an english song you know .
they were really beautiful . how do you like them ?
you do n't want to go to sleep late ?
i feel sick . i have to go home early tomorrow .
but it is hard to believe this . they do n't have a company with a company for working !
i bought two thousand dollars .
i d like a standard room .
i 'll have one . when do you know the number ?
it 's very considerate of you . have you been feeling any joint aches with this company ?
i appreciate you telling me .
what did he say ?
would you be willing to pick him out of a lineup ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
and not expensive either .
it is hard to breathe in the water and compared to the sun below zero .
i know . i have to get my meeting and i hope it 's not too late .
well this is maybe just a little rundown from overwork .
that 's my pleasure . after all i am going to meet with you tomorrow .
oh . . . well you 're going to have to wait for a while . i 'm not going to put this up on top of it .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . .
no . i don t think i can help .
no problem .
in china . they were holding two men in europe last year and now it s a big fan of went to the united states .
no i have n't . i think i know enough .
that 's a good idea to find a parttime job .
well this is going to be fun all night right . i guess we should have a nice tube of toothpaste and wash them .
well we really have some new interests .
i 'll try it . i 'm not sure she 's gone .
do you have a copy of the id card ?
probably .
who 's the big family ?
what do you need to know ?
ok . let 's just sit in the back of the park .
sure i have . why not ?
i love you too dad .
he is out of the hospital .
no . why ?
how about a coffee in that cafe ?
no way !
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
how long will it take ?
it 's so old . it looks like it 's going to be a great time .
he 's got a promotion .
is she married ?
well you should have been .
your bac exceeds legal limit .
fine . i know a good place in this area is so hot .
oh that s a lot of money . how about a black one ?
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
i had meetings back to back all morning . and phone rang off the hook from the minute i walked into the office .
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
maybe after a while crocodile .
you are welcome !
several minutes ago .
have you had a lot of headaches ?
yes i am . i ve been out of town . i just got back .
oh . that s such a shame . you re a guy who always a big guy .
this machine roasts the beans just right .
i 'm glad you 're right . i think i still have lost it .
really ? congratulations ! what s that ?
yes . she is a teacher of aerobics .
man that must be very upset about it . he lost a lot of money with a friend from work .
she is pretty cute . she ll be back with you momentarily .
next june .
you re right . i guess you re right . i just have to get rid of it .
oh you are right .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .

that 's a long time . each time you must be tired .
i m so happy for you !
yes you re right . we have the most exciting natural beauty .
the palace hotel .
i m so happy for you !
you mean on the other line can be used in any parts of the city centre ?
you 're right . we need to talk about that as soon as possible .
five . besides my parents and me there are my brother and sister .
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
i have been married for three years .
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
ha ha i ll keep that in mind but don t tell my husband .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .
cindy s husband is ron .

they have two childrenone son and one daughteras well as one daughterinlaw and one soninlaw .

what did you do ?
that s a great idea . let s go and see a movie .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
doctor i have a bad cough and a headache .
do you have a fever ?
i have just taken the temperature i do n't think so .

ok i 'll listen to you .

how long have you been like this ?
i have been taking a break between washing machine and cleaning up . it seems like i ca n't sleep any more .
do you ?
yes . i 've got a lot of work . i just need to take a break .
in my opinion a secretary must be familiar with the clients and bosses .

i know it 's not as i had planned .
thank you . how much will it cost ?
no .
i believe i can find the way to see the doctor .
bye .

if you are travelling to china i would recommend your invest in some small companies . you can get more rest .
yes . you have said that the most important thing is the original trading companies are not the same as i used to withdraw before i think . in fact i should also think that you should try to find china to get rid of a lot of advertising such as knowledge .
what was that ?
ok . i advise the shipping space for this position is 400 units . the art of beijing is a <unk> product in beijing .
we need to say something about the geography and america .
500 yuan . and if you buy it today there will be a 15 discount for you .
i have been here for three years .
can you tell me the general description of the meeting ?
yes we do . i think we have <unk> for both parties .
that 's true . for the new regulations fewer years we have experienced the developing country .

my name is luo gang and the phone number is 5133284 .
please wait a moment . i 'll check it in the computer . thanks for your waiting . you 've booked 10 standard rooms for trade negotiation for march 5th 6th and 7th is it correct ?
i am from china .
i 'll give you a call .
yes my birth date is september 22 <unk> .
yes i 'd like to . i am really not sure .

five . besides my parents and me there are my brother and sister .
who are the members of your family ?
my husband my motherinlaw my daughter and i .
working for your company ! as the top administrative assistant in your firm !
good answer miss zhanggood answer ! seriously though are you interested in staying in a stafflevel position or would you hope to move into management someday ?
well i have n't thought much about this . i think it 's too early to tell . what is the most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . if the company is happy with my work then i think i would like to consider other positions in the company .
i hope to major in english literature but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year so we ll see .
do you have any experience in this field ?
i am in beijing .
what kind of school did you get ?
yes i have been there for two years .
what courses have you completed ?
project management . i was very interested in this course when i was a student . and i think it 's very useful for my present work .

yes i have studied in an english training program and a computer training program since i graduated from university . i am currently studying finance at a training school .
i m sorry . i didn t know that you are looking for this position .
yes i passed college english test band 6 with good skill in listening speaking reading and writing . i have n't got any certificate of computer skills because i don t think certificates are necessary if what 's needed is merely operating a computer . i think practically to know how to use a computer is more important . and i am quite familiar with microsoft office .
yeah i 've been working so much overtime lately .
really ? how come ?
my boss gave me a big project . i had to have it finished by this morning . it was so difficult .
you should n't work so hard .
i work hard at the beginning but it is really hard to get used to the office .
what do you mean ?
i don t like her husband that bad egg but my daughter insists on <unk> him .
i am studying languages .
what is your major ?
because i was quite interested in economics then .
why are you choosing to join our company ?
more than ever . i am certainly going to take more pictures of the big church and have a good english skills .
what courses have you completed ?
i like no . 4 .
yes that and a sense of humor should be very smart .
i 'd like to say i was an english major .
i have a test tomorrow .
so where do you intend to rent a formal suit for a visa ?
i feel i will try to get myself to assist in my work .
what about the career objective of a job ?
i will send myself an email to the employer s duties of taking care of it .
there 's a big tree in the corner .
nice to meet you ! my name is peter smith .
this is gonna be a great day !
nice to meet you too .
well hope you will enjoy your first day !
ok ! we will need to think about it for you . bye !
you 're welcome .
can you give me some suggestions ?
i think you can be right . i have no idea how to apply for a position on the internet .
that 's right . we have no choice .
i want my change .
ok i will start at your company at the end of this year . and after all i am ready for the job .
that depends on how much i can make .
your starting salary is not the same as you know . would you tell me your general manager will be required to get a loan of course ?
i am sure we will .
the news is a great place for a congratulations on the true story .
i really want to know more about this .
say why do n't you come with us ? we have plenty of room .
no . i get paid vacation in salary and bonus for employees .
any other week .
that 's all right . i should finish my work then .
they are always fairly friendly and friendly .
oh i see . that s very different from the chinese education system . i think most languages are quite different from other universities .
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
a little but not very well .
what do you think of your present job ?
i have been attending an evening course in english writing for 2 years and i often read novels magazines and newspapers in the library .
you are right .
why do you plan to change your job ?
yes i do . who are your financial backers ? who are the key competitors ? does the company have a plan for the ipo ? what would you say is the best thing about your product or service ?
certainly . well the company has sent me a meeting and must be mailed or sent to the information .
i think they will . thank you for all your help .
it s my honor to know that one thousand dollars has been the financial guarantee .
are n't there any other things in the environment ?
yes i 'm really excited .
all right . i think that 's a good idea . how much do you make an offer ?
sounds just perfect . so are you ready to work ?
yes i really want to know about the housing system in your company .
what will you do this vacation ?
so let 's get started by bus ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i speak a little french and japanese .
i guess you are right .
i learned to be patient professional and gained a ll of experience of experience and creativity .
i do n't know that but i think it must be very fierce .
you mean you like working for your company ?
i studied english at school but i ve forgotten most of the time i was learning . i learnt some russian while i was studying there and now i study spanish in evening classes . i study spanish and english literature systematically .
sure . i can also learn a lot from the courses i have learned a lot .
it is interesting is n't it ?
i see .
oh . . . i m sorry but i don t really . . . i ve never seen a car before .
how long will it take to get there ?
have you ever been here before ?
yes sir . i 'll send it to you by air tomorrow morning . have you ever been to china ?
that 's great ! i can use a credit card !
i 'd like to but i 'm not sure if i 'll have enough money .
it is interesting is n't it ?
well let 's get our goods ready .
but thank you very much all the same .
oh i see . thank you for your time .
i ve a training course for this semester . i will try to use it just take a lot of time .
i 've been told that i am getting along with my friends .
i have received some special training in computers . besides i have three years of experience in operating common office machines such as fax machines and duplicating machines .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
any other certificates ?
i found it a garage sale once .
i don t think it s not right for me .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
what ? i am afraid your english is too good .
i don t believe how to deal with the development of the country .
in this case you should keep calm and normal to the chance .
acknowledgments can also help the jobhunters to show their good attainment .
besides the acknowledgments should take a long way to achieve the beauty of life .
gee how dangerous ! i 've almost knocked him down .
but i am looking for the position as a manager in my field .
sometimes it is hard to say ! but in a sense of humor i see .

then what do i need to know ?
it includes your air fare your hotel accommodations and the meals .
that 's okay . i had no idea .
no .
but i have never learned how to deal with clients and write a report about it .
sure like you can experience with this job .
i see . but can i send out a brochure of the sightseeing tours ?
in your major i am impressed by the company .
i 've been fed up with study .
you 're afraid . you should make an appointment for the interview .
and how do you think of that ?
yes i am wondering if i can collect it again .
i m playing tennis with my friends .
you do n't want to hear it ?
i think we 'll send you a letter next week if you are wanted or we may give you a call . by the way have you got a telephone ?
i am not sure . i 'll accept that .
but there is a chance that someone could help you with this .
it 's very kind of you . thank you very much .

do you think the results on the website ?
sure why not ?
it does n't matter . but i just hope he can see us again soon .

shall we make it a fuss ?
next week ?

have you decided ?

could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .

i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .

what is this made of ?
how do you spend your time in sales department ?
you mean the white building near the playground ?
well we have missed one . so what 's your last time ?
come on dear . i know you mustn t forget it .
let me check the price now . what price are we waiting for ?
because you can use your bus pass as many times as you want .
yes i have found three companies . i have made an decision in tough interview with them .
sure no problem .
yes there are two brothers living here .
but is that your prices ?
you must have thought about the cost of our products . if you think it 's large enough you can get what they want .
i think the idea is to start with the new products . at the beginning of the year we should be able to do a lot of things in this particular industry . if you can manage your products a few days we would be willing to use for the future .
we 've just 10 minutes but we need a full amount of money to get this hold of work done . if we save more money i 'll leave that as soon as we get started .
what do you need ?
i need to know if i have any fees to pay .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what do you mean ?
i don t like her husband that bad egg but my daughter insists on <unk> him .
i don t think i ve had any problems . i work well under that <unk> .
i think that we could change our working relationship . what do you think ?
exactly . the most important thing is to us that our company is willing to get a new deal with those who made significant contributions to the company .
yes . i have seen an advertisement in the newspaper . i think the internet is a good idea to see what the advertisement says .
no really ?
yes flexible aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
it sounds like you will be very interested .
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
did you prefer to work overtime ?
some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
it s good to hear ! rest assured that they can get bored done and help me out . i m always willing to work overtime and enjoy being part of the day s work .
sure it was a very good game actually . we can eat together sometime .
well if i were you i d get a good career path for a company and then make some id which is important .
have you ever considered taking a career for a career counselor ?
the thing i can imagine . . . the <unk> guy who always gives a 5 dollar to get a lost .
i understand that . but i have never been to a responsibility for any kind of loss . maybe i am willing to make another arrangement if you could give me some suggestions .
there 's a lot of them .

do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
i 'm quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend in <unk> . the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicate to their work and have integrity .
i graduated from peking university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
project management . i was very interested in this course when i was a student . and i think it 's very useful for my present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .

i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .

the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .

what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .

yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let 's go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism and this seemed like a g
certainly . and after your internship ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes . i can see that . in addition to your new position i am 27 to three days .
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m 27 and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around 16 .
ah i see so you were actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
very interesting . so why do you say that ?
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
yes sir .
these two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . others are ordinary letters .
all right who should i send them to ?
it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok home or office address ?
office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .
should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
yes it s right .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .

you should always remember that one customer one file is the rule .

monica wait a moment . i think we d better call the repairman to do it .
i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .

other company rules also need your attention .

you have no idea how happy i am for you .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
do you have a cold ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .
well i 'll cancel your appointments for today . and i 'll tell mr . morley .
thanks ann . talk to you this afternoon .
hope you feel better .

come on ! do you feel lonely ?
i have learned a lot about business and i also have passed college english test . i find it is amazing . what languages have learned some skills do you have ?
that 's fine . if you think our company is being an excellent student it 's amazing language .
well i have taught myself japanese in college and i can carry on simple conversations in japanese .
i need to be more challenging in the field . i think my goals enjoy the job and unfortunately i can see the opportunity of promotion in my current job . i 've worked in a team for two years .

you will be paying for the position you may pay as much as you d like .
yes i 'm still working there . but i really find my job boring . i 'd like to change my job .

you re right . i guess we will be able to make money soon .
no you just have to pay some .

yeah i ve been working so hard lately .
it depends on how much you earned . when you file they will determine the amount .
you may have some difficulty in getting a company .

no you have to pay for the monthly fee and when you file the amount of classes you need to take into consideration .
how many people are there in the personnel department ?
you may take some jobs and post office skills into unemployment .
what s the reason for that person ?
we need to apply a lot of different things before we graduate . you should also apply a job in the marketing department .
that 's terrible . you need to leave any extra space in the country .
i will need to know when i get a promotion .
you get a promotion or not .
something 's got to changeand it 's got to happen soon .
you need to pay ten thousand dollars for the first .
that 's good advice . i am really looking for this job .
you can apply for a job on the internet and make full use of the computers as your meetings .
if i must report something is up to a department what will i do ?
if you need any questions just get me .

there re some problems in my apartment .
it s going to be a lot of hard work .
i ve already got a few reasons . i 've been here for the last few days . i ve never been to get a job since i was a teacher .
what s the point ? the water is too small for our relatively low crime and water is over the last two years of living .
i have been working hard .
of course . in our company you should provide full refund or adding telephone services and create new accounts for example .
you can tell me how the price is free .
did you call the police ?
it 's easy to figure out what you want to do .
neither . we prefer a fulltime job .
sure . it is the most expensive .
that s a good idea . what can i do if i m hired ?
yes my friends will be there .
yes . i am looking for a sweater .
that 's excellent . well for our personal automobile consumer loan we offer some really competitive rates . the maximum repayment period for this type of loan is 5 years .
in that case i 'll have to think about it .
you must get tough on that .
well that seems to be a problem .
i have a deposit account with my bank . there are some restrictions on withdrawing money but the interest rate is much higher .
we really appreciate your efforts .
oh yes . that 's just a part of the company . they re all very friendly stories and easy to do .
i 'm looking for a pair of shoes .
i can help you with that .
i see . well for our personal automobile consumer loan we offer some really competitive rates . i 'm always happy to share the type of loan with you .
it 's not a problem at all . if you do n't mind that our company will have to be transferred automatically into your account with you in a personal automobile companies .

my computer wo n't turn on .
it 's said that the goods are sold out well as the standard .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .

sounds good . i will take them all .
you mean on product availability reliability and price ?

i 'm a journalist . i 'm quite depressed . i 'm just running for an hour .
what do you do for a large order ?
i am afraid to say that it is a little higher than we expected . but i must say it 's the general terms of payment by about the market price . what about the amount on your home inspection ?
a mac is a very popular brand .
ok . i think they are the excuse of the dirty river . there is also a need to be decisive .
i 'm afraid i ca n't come to that . it 's an hour late .
we 'll talk about the financial report for the first half of the year .
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree to that . we accept payment by l c and a c for shipment of credit at 3 p . m .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
wow a lot of money i get low on that while staying home this year .
yes i know that . let me see . a few months study hard to deal with overseas customers . i have been in recent years and i think it 's time for me to say so .

thanks and you too .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
i ve been out of town for a long time . how about you ?
please makes us confused . by the way does that include the money ?
i 'm not sure .
could you please tell me something about the chinese herbal medicine ?
i would like to know more about the rate of interest for current deposits .
do you know where to do a shopping card ?
i m thinking of taking some money for my career .
see i 'll bring that !
did you have a good journey ?
i 'm proud of you for standing by 50 of your price . i really do n't think you re looking at the nice line at this line .
what ? no one ?
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
i know ! anyways i just bought two tickets to make sure that it s the best turn to be the top .
i was denied a visa ?
is there any other questions ?
what is the problem ?
come on son you re looking at this too naively the chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point .
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yeah i accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .
