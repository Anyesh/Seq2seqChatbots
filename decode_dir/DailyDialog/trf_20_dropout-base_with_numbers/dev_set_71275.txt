i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
and that 's good advice .
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
all right but you 're going to love it .
please . thank you .
now i see . thank you .
hi .
certainly . come on in please .
how about some fish ?
put your job experience first if that 's the case .
thank you . i 'll be sure to take a look .
if you agree to pay more money i can think about it .

i need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks . can you deliver ?
why not ?

can i pay by card ?
no problem . we can offer you on the internet .
all right but you 're going to love it .

health monitor ? i read an article about that racket . they re overpriced to begin with ! listen if i were you i 'd let them take back their monitor and spend my money on something more practical .
hmm . i think it would be appropriate to take it a few days to make a sense of fifty dollars .
yes .

i 'm not sure what 's wrong with it .
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .

i 'm not sure if it 's your fault .

what shall i do with it ?
no . it 's only a few minutes walk .
how far is it ?
you 're welcome .
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?

my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .
i see . well i can help with the chores while i m here . you two could probably use my help .

that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that 's a lot of money . we ll have to take it back in about 2 weeks .
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing .
that s even better than the real thing .
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than 100 you get a 50 voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
of course . the fitting room is right over there .

i think we have a very good choice . this will definitely come to our room .
it tastes great .
enjoy yourself .
yeah .
no just a little steak .
i agree . i do n't like its taste . what do you recommend ?
it 's a hotel but cheaper and offers free parking .
i agree . there are a lot of options . what do you have ?

you 're welcome .
it 's excellent .
well . you know i heard that if you like i 'll go and have a look at the menu .
how much is it ?
i 'm sure everyone 's here . on a business trip is a little special . we do n't have any other questions .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
i 'm here for the backpack you announced several minutes ago .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
so she is n't causing you any problems ?
well there is something wrong with her .
what did you do ?
do n't worry . you 've got your passport and the id card .

may i know what you do ?
how much do you want to spend ?
would you like to reserve a private dining room ?
i hear that in a really good shape .
oh a shame . i do n't know what to do .
it 's a total ripoff of an american reality show but the imitation is unbearably clumsy .
you 're right . i should have a good rest and do it tomorrow .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
if i were you i 'd like to stay home .

the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
about 20 minutes .
i see . thanks a lot .
not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
hello this is smith from 1308 can you add something to my room ?

can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .

no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
since everyone is different your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . then you 'llbe taught all the necessary techniques to us
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
you know i really do n't want to tell me .
well . i 've got a lot of cereal .
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the seed ?

let s rock and roll band probably .

the officer says there is no other way .

they re really nice you know .
yes but i do n't think they are right .
are you a hurry sir ?
how come ?
do you have any idea where your bedroom is ?
i m a nurse .
how about this red dress ? i think it would really suit you .
ok . i 'll find it .
what day would you like to reserve a room ?
what do you mean ?
can i try it on ?
well the company has a lot of experience and i also think that s good .
where to ?
wangfujing please !
do you have any rooms available ?
i have to be there before <unk> .
sure .
that 's fine . would you please arrange it for me ?
i 'll do my best .
here 's twenty dollars .
it 's about 5 .
oh i am sorry .
please fill out the exchange form and we need to see your passport .
yeah here you go .
hello madam . where to ?
a oneway ticket to chicago please .
very well . thank you .
i 'm completely lost .
we do n't have to do that . how would you like to pay for the registration ?
here is ten dollars .
it is at the north of forbidden city on the central axis of beijing .
will you be able to get a taxi ?
thank you . can i have the bill now ?
why do you ask ?
thank you .
hello . is there anything i can do for you ?
yes speaking .
thank you . and what is the price of your <unk> ?
i 'm sorry i 've got plans .
i got the message . i 'm quiting .
no problem .
see you .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time will he be back ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i will call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
does that include hotels and meals ?
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you have to pay it all by yourself .
do you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
he should n't be able to get any sleep on the weekend .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello !
hi linda . i have two concert complimentary tickets . will you be joining us on saturday ?
it 's probably true but i 'm trying to call my boss . i was having an important meeting with my boss .
i 'm very well thank you .
i 've been working too .
well then what 's your new title ?
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
well i think you 'd better get used to the job . but now you will have to fill me in .
what time do i need to make an appointment ?
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
for about two years .
quite right .
she 's pretty outgoing . i 've heard that the people treat as a stock analyst .
what does she look like ?
well i 'm afraid not . the watch says it 's going to be a blast !
that 's a great idea . he used to be very <unk> though .
what happened ?
thank you .
i 'll be there .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
no you do n't ! the first thing is to be finished . i want your hair to be dyed . if you take it to the initiative and it will be ready for you to put your lipstick into the pan .
you certainly have a good career path down my side of the hill .
yeah we can make it . it looks like you re gonna have a great time !
what 's the cause of gas ?
we can t do it ! we can t just sit there and go !
just soso . you should do some jogging . are you sure ?
oh peter ! come on !
i m afraid not . i don t have a car . i think my husband had a bad cold .
yes . i m looking for a job as a clerk typist in english .
well you can buy several postcards from here . are you looking for a particular brand ?
i m not sure . i ll take a look at the newest 10 .
what s your camera ?
quite right . now i have an 8 additional credits this time for should be open and 6 .
do you have a pen that i do ?
thank you very much .
really ? that s amazing .
how about a picnic set ?
i m sorry . we don t have any sympathy for people . we can buy through them .
any other ?
i don t think we can afford that . he s a millionaire .
what is it like living in this city ?
i 'm not sure .
my car is still on the broken side .
ah thank you so much !
i think so too .
how are you finding your new boss ?
i 'd like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
no .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
what s the weather like in your country ?
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i want to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hello i would like a room please .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes . i 've got a few pictures of the company .
is anyone else wrong with it ?
it s a good spot . this is basically your card . what s your name ?
yes i am glad it did n't rain . the wall keeps coming back in .
good news !
it is a little more expensive sir .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
how about winter ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
what size do you wear ? these dresses are on sale .
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's no hot water after 10 at night . sometimes i like to have a hot shower before bed . especially in the winter . it feels good .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s a very good idea to have a large face in the kitchen .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
i m not sure . perhaps we could find a solution to the community .
i have n't thought of that .
thank you . my wife would be very happy to hear this .
how s your job going ?
it s only 725 a month .
that s way too much .
what s the most important thing to be nosey .
what do you mean ?
that s 25 dollars not a bonus .
thank you .
would you please reconsider ?
thanks for saying that .
i m not sure but i just don t know anyone .
i love it . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . it gives me a real sense of satisfaction . do you enjoy cooking ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah . i like the way that the food is so delicious . i love it .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
are you sure ?
our house special is a bit tight . i think you should have a bigger one .
i am afraid it 's a bit too heavy . i would like to get a bigger one .
you might want to tell me about the price of yours .
there s a department store on grant street . there are other options on the internet too .
hey i just started a little more today .
i see . how much is that ?
they 're both fine . can i try them on ?
what else ?
the brown one you have on looks fabulous especially with your hair like that .
thank you for your reminding . i 'll be back at the coffee shop a little later .
i m going to put it on your list .
i 'm afraid you have the wrong number . you may have the wrong number .
do i need to pay any extra change for the whole accounts ?
yes it 's still vacant . i 'm looking for a onebedroom apartment .
i am not sure . i think i could afford that apartment .
all you 're right . i love it very much .
good . i will see you then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
maybe we could go to the city centre and have a look at .
yes but do n't forget to call me .
ok .
no but if you 'd like to bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ?
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
but the price has been reduced by 50 . it 's a real bargain .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes . we have a very good reputation in the neighborhood .
let s rock and roll band 6 o 'clock .
in the meantime do you work out the website for me ?
with so few windows how can you even see what the problems are ?
do you have a balcony ?
i really like it here so far .
the best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom .
i do n't think it will .
three . two boys and a girl .
come on ! it is an amazing curry and a good one ! they are very cheap but very cheap .
it looks like it should be on your way to catch a dragon boat .
in the early 70s . we ll soon be celebrating the 30th anniversary .
which antivirus program would you recommend ?
it 's a perfect fit for me . let 's see if there 's a small wooden dress in here .
wow this place is so beautiful . i love the design and flowers .
i love this place !
thank you .
that s what i said .
i 'm the apartment manager . how can i help you ?
hello i m calling to see if you have made your decision . you are the right person we are seeking for .
oh really ? which apartment is that ?
i am not sure .
who is your favorite singer ?
i appreciate it .
when will you be convenient ?
ok . i 'll call you when i get there .
we have a deal then .
do i have to pay to use the whole accounts department ?
no but if you 're hungry you can bring some foldup chairs for people .
yes i 'd like to change some money to cover my expenses here . what 's today 's rate of us dollar against the rib yuan ?
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it only goes
well . good for you .
yes .
i got the message . i 'm quiting .
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want to waste waste a pc . but i do n't think it 's just a waste of money .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
i m not sure .
i got the message . i 'm quiting .
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
oh i 'm from taiwan .
i 'm sure you 'll enjoy yourselves .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
do you prefer an appetizer ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
i 'm planning on doing my job . it 's about time to move on .
the working department i d like to use my visa .
i 'm sorry . we do n't know the rules you want to do .
yes . i think it 's a good idea .
what color do you want ?
i 'm afraid i do n't agree with you . i 'm not a very light sleeper but i 'd like to get a new one .
i have the known in that area is something i can do for you . it is my first time to do the job of a company .
no we do n't need a maid . we 'll give you an injection of anaesthesia about 30 to 45 minutes in advance . if you do n't want to put you up with a fire before you can go .
it 's time to go . bye ella . hope to see you soon
yes . the one i have a few different color .
i got the message . i 'm quiting .
no longer . i ca n't imagine how stupid you are .
i bet you eat a lot of water . what 's your favorite ?
oh i see .
it 's <unk> . it was actually a friend in need of mine .
oh i 'll try .
yes sir . we have an hour appointment at eight .
the <unk> is excellent . you can make it many pictures .
all right . you 're all set . if you do n't mind i 'll show you the receipt .
have you ever seen a hurricane ?
well i know what you mean . i 've been thinking of a quiet apartment but i need to find a place in the suburbs .
what do you mean ?
the house is ok . let s go check out the kitchen next .
i like the house too .
i want a different hair style .
let s also check out the kitchen next .
yes it does . we usually do it too . we usually use the whole house for a few days .
yes they are .
where is it ?
how long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?
sure that would be wonderful .
it s a good idea . it would be very expensive .
where is that ?
why did you ask me ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
where is it ?
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
no it 's not . if you 're hungry then cook something .
fine . i would like to see what is it like .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
would you like some more rice ?
i prefer sea food .
do you know what you mean ?
i 'm not sure .
well it looks very nice .
i like spaghetti .
ok ! would you like some rice or noodles with that ?
not really . i do n't mind eating carrots but i 'm a vegetarian . i like to try out a vegetarian .
do you like some soup ?
thank you .
well have you ever had lunch ?
it 's the secret . i 'd like to try that .
hmm . . . it 's good that you 'll share the taxi with me .
all right sir . what about a space ?
oh there are many things i need to do . i can help my family family family family on a trip . how about you ?
where is the new milk shop ?
i guess that 's what i 'm looking for . i 'll leave my message .
sorry . you have to go to the other counter .
alright . and what is your name ?
you 're welcome .
no nothing in particular .
i want a different hair style .
the difference in your opinion is a bit high quality . you know we have to establish a credit card with you .
you mean i should be careful with the dress ?
what time do you begin ?
so are you planning to buy some clothes and food ?
i was hoping to get a few new apartment .
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
i want to get a few months trial .
i 'm not sure of it .
it 's a great idea . let 's do it .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
that 's strange . i heard that they are looking at people in the tv and are lower than their home .
yes . her company is a very famous one for its beautiful clients .
good . i am here visiting my girlfriend . i want her to have a good time .
the late fee is 25 cents a day .
how much do you think we should spend on a bus ?
ok . i ll get them for you .
yes . i would like to go to new york for my christmas vacation .
do you need anything else ?
i lost it .
what is the difference ?
i would like to return it to one .
go and try it on .
okay i 'll take the yellow ones .
oh i 'm going to go down to new york .
is there any other price ?
i see . would you mind telling me then what you think of all your money ?
oh . i see .
i 'm glad to hear that . you are everything i 've been travelling on business .
i hope they re not too hard !
i 'm glad to hear that . you see i 'm fed up with those shipping documents .
here you are .
thank you .
well . . . to be honest i ca n't afford that .
if you wait here 's your bus pass .
sure go ahead .
i think you can give me some advice . you have worked here longer and i just want to know what you think .
do i have any other choices ?
is anyone else sick in your home ?
anything else ?
have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?
i do n't think they are right but they will have to cut out their <unk> to make sure they are in the right direction .
i 've never had a pet that i do n't really know .
my second ! this tea towel s a little ragged . do you have another one ?
what ?
how about the umbrella ? it 's very beautiful .
haha i 'm not that bad at all .
i did n't know that .
no i did n't . i 'm a thief .
yes i do it a lot .
that 's it ! that 's a great little hightech for one and you have really good taste . it 's a very reliable . i 'll show you some <unk> that are a little too small for you .
once a week .
yeah i m going to have to cut down on your sugar to caffeine .
saving money ? how much money can you save by taking it ?
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like .
well i add some eggs and bread .
basically we have a few coffees while we have a wide selection of vanilla ice and get them !
not at all . we usually eat mutton .
do you have any idea what we need ?
i 've never tasted anything like that .
yes . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i am pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
i like fish .
oh i see . take it easy . i have an appointment with the dentist .

black is good . but a little more powerful vehicle . it wo n't work without caffeine .
hmm . . . i 'm told my friend 's birthday is a real thing .
sounds good . i 'll try that .
it would be a good idea to have such a good time !
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i think you are right .
yeah why not . do you want to eat all the things i want to eat ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
yes . i have to go to the cinema with my friend .
i do n't know what to say .
you 're going to cook it .
i do n't know what to make .
what do you feel like having ?
i was thinking of pizza .
that sounds really good .
okay i 'll grill some corn then .
i have no idea . i like cooking by myself .
do n't worry . i 'm sure you 'll enjoy cooking .
do you know what to do ?
would you like tea or coffee ?
good idea .

apple pie is my favorite .
that will be fine .
red cooked carp and <unk> with sugar and so on .

well it does n't matter .
i have to get a flat on the fifth floor .
did you see anyone come into the block flats ?
i believe it can catch a bus .
what 's the problem ?
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials materials materials materials . the materials ignite it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .
but i prefer summer especially in the winter .
well our sales are very different . we know they know .
here 's your number .
not good . i lost my wallet .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
what can i do for you today ?
i have n't taken a taxi .
what time should i come and do something ?
no . but i 'll have to pay by bus .
you have your own vehicle ?

oh i have no idea . what 's the problem ?
that 's wonderful !
that 's right .
my name is sam . it was the first time i was the little boy .
i won 200 to spend on any books of my choice .
you like panda express ?
no not really .
well i 'm afraid it is is sir . but i can t guarantee it will be a lot more than 200 yuan .
if i do n't have time to tip it would n't be too expensive .
oh ! thank you .
could you do me a favor ?
it 's me . i am working on this . why do n't you join me for a walk ?
my boss is going to send me an email to inform you that i am happy to go with my colleagues .
we can go to the park in the city this afternoon . i will help you prepare for the zoo .

it s the same as michael jordan .
i think you 're right .
i think i want to try a new style .
but you what if i were you i would n't have done .
i have to study every day .

the doctor will be back on in a few days .
i want to study german .
what 's your favorite kind of sport ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no i do n't .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
well there s one thing .
what ?
i have a high fever and a bad headache .
how about a good idea ?
i bought one size up by mistake .
well i think you 're a good cook . but when you are chinese you will learn english very well .
can you tell me how to use them ?
fine . how are you doing these days ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
i 'm going to try to quit my job . i 'm an it .
i 'd love to but i am not sure if i can do it .
well we have several apartment available . you can get a lot of information about your new apartment .
it 's just that you have to be patient .
see you .
what if i leave little late i 'll try to get him something done .
it 's a total ripoff of an american reality show but the imitation is unbearably clumsy .
honestly speaking i am very pleased with it .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i have been doing the same . i just hope to learn the language well .
if you are n't too busy i would like to take a course .
i think so .
it is my favorite .
i want to talk to you about the first course .
do you have any experience in this field ?
i see .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i see . well where can i get the money from ?
well i think you should decide for yourself . you can collect the same as other language as a manager .
i really do n't know . i guess i could n't find a way to figure out what the pay for .
i 'll call the bus charter later . and have you heard of our city ?
how long will the tour take me to get my things back ?
ok . let 's go and find some fun .
that must be very interesting . they must have a lot of fun .
i know . but i m a little worried about my english . i do n't know why a lot of english is n't so boring .
i 'll have to study .
you re going to take courses ?
yes i am . i 'll be studying chinese .
sounds hard .
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
i think i 'll buy one too .
of course i do . i 'm too excited to learn something about it .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
of course . it 's on memorial avenue .
ok . thank you very much .
you can check out two books at a time .
got it . thank you very much .
for two weeks . after that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer .
ok . thank you very much .
there are many universities for you to choose from . some famous universities such as harvard yale the university of michigan and massachusetts institute of technology are really wonderful places to study but they are very competitive and expensive .
i 'll take the tapestry the set of table wear and the vase .
you 're welcome .
my name is sam .
my name is james .
nice to meet you too .
yes it is . i 'm going to be a student .
can i help you ?
how did you like the show ?
hmm . . . i think it s a good idea to get a good team player .
is that right ? wonderful wonderful . i 've been in king dao for two years now . a great place . nice people and great beer ! well i guess we d better get started .
why ?
i am going to visit my sister in the city .

it 's my pleasure .
no but i did n't .
yes .
i want to take a driver 's course .
what about the one ?
it 's hard to say . now you can start with the one .
i 'm going to send you a copy of the haunted house . will you be able to get any luggage on ?
i 'm going to need a driver 's license .
all right madam . what kind of drink do you want ?
i see . well in fact i 'm going to miss you .
well i believe you sir . but the other choices are actually quite different from what you are talking about !
are you serious ?
i think so . he is a fairly good friend .
he is surely a hard nut nobody likes approaching him .
you are free .
do you have any other questions ?
i took a parttime job last semester in translating and doing reception work for an exhibition . my work included hosting the visiting foreign exhibitors communicating with them arranging their agenda and translating several materials . i think this activity well demonstrated my ability in english . and i will be glad to take any form of english test you arrange for me to prove my ability .
you speak really well .
oh yes i do n't know why i need to learn english .
i do n't think you 'd like that . i do n't think i 'd like it .
i got a business degree in english in a training school .
let 's plan a little bit of a detective film .
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind .

yeah he s been like this for two weeks .
i 've noticed you 've been working overtime a lot .
i do n't know .
well i 'm really glad we did n't have so many chance to attend .
it 's not too bad . it was a bit pricey . . . i 'm sure our customers will have to think about it .

it was n't as high as i would have liked . it was 2 .
she 's really a healthy boy .
i do n't know . i just found a little funny .

what should we do with jack out of the game ?
ok well let 's take a look at the final review .
sure well first of all it 's easy . first of all the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple . people are listening and they usually do n't have a long attention <unk> .

why ? you mean i m planning to quit ?

oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
you can transfer to the student office over there .
oh you are kidding . that 's the sort of thing .
it 's on the fifth avenue .
well he is a hard case . everyone would feel headache about him .
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i am worried .
what about ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
oh is that all ?
i just need the problem fixed .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i suppose i 'm going to drive to the university of hawaii .
i understand .
do you have any experience as a tourist guide ?
i remember a case that was filled with obstacles . the first thing i did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . i assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . i was able to get some input from another lawyer i happened to see at lunch . through some recommendations which she had done . i was able to see at lunch . i had done . through
what ? what do you mean by that ?
i think we can make it .
what ? what do you mean ?
that s good service . do i have to pay extra money to check these against charges ?
i think you re right . i m thinking about making a new one .
very serious . just take it easy .
great . thank you .
what can i do for you today ?
i need to get a passport .
what do you need ?
i need to use the internet .
did you check the periodicals ?
i didn t even bother to think of that .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
i believe they are a local delicacy in the south .
are you sure you have the time ?
thank you very much .
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
this is the same size . two for the design and the design of the design .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
why do you say so ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i need to make a deposit .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
thank you . can i have your original id card back ?
i don t understand how to make a statement .
yes .

i think we are all right . anyway what are you going to do ?
how do you know there was a breakin ?

no i am not sure .
i want to make a sandwich for you to get some eggs and bread for breakfast .
i 'll go and get it .
they 're due to be kind of wife who can be out of a drink .
i guess the other team won the first .
should we walk ?
in that case i 'll go through the materials that you get with me and draw some <unk> .
i want justice .
no . i 'm not sure . you know my favorite groups are a big fan of keeping fit in this region .
all right . what are the gifts attaching ?
i got a <unk> .
i 'm not sure . maybe we 'll come back to join you .
it 's a quarter to 12 . could you drive a little faster ?
me too . i 'll probably go out to the gym to open a new year . it 's good for them to do any exercise .
how about a china vase ?
that would be great . when would you be returning ?
we will get a promotion on our own .
i 'm a student .
do n't worry . i will study hard tomorrow .
no .
thanks a lot .
i get well with people and they get along with each other .

when i talk to you i want to know i always consider what i should do .
have you taken your driving test ?
yeah i think it s great . where are you going ?

what are you going to major in ?
do n't worry . i 'm going to have a good day . i can do my homework now .
but why ?
i need to return a book .
what s the problem ?
yes i have it .
what ?
when would you deliver my resume ?
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
do you have your library card ?
now i want you to look some pictures .
here you go .
you re a real pal ! i ll call now to set up an interview .
i appreciate it .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
you should ve more money .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
his parents must feel very happy .
i don t want to leave .
i will .
maybe you are right . but if you like it he has a good husband and he doesn t have a fever .
but i like its color .
anyway it 's my ideal coat . i 'll take it .
i 'll take one too .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to my liking too .
say how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
tell me what you eat .
it 's said that the cowherd and the spinster the lover stars in heaven can only meet on the seventh eve so this day has become the lover 's day .
but what ?
why ?
i m not good at it . i just hope i can recover from the failure .
wow ! that s great ! i know a lot about the kids . where is your parents ?
yes it is .
have you been under a lot of stress lately ?
have you had a slight fever ?
could you do that ?
these are the new figures for years . what are you going to do with us ?
that 's interesting . bet my love story when she was young .
i have been playing football since high school . at present i m a member of a community football club .
it s a good idea . but i want to know if you are going to take it seriously .
great . then it must be a good thing to do . then i can go back together with the <unk> .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes ?
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
who won ?
look at my eyes .
sounds like you 've done a lot of homework .
my blood pressure broke down .
oh my god . we 'll try it .
what 's up ?
me too . i know you work for a company .
it said that the book is on the shelf but it isn t .
and you did n't get any sleep ?
thank you but i do n't have any time to check out the camping gear .
that 's all right .
you know what ? why do n't you say about that ?
no .
it looks like it was made just for you .
your dream will have a pleasant stay .
a dozen will be fine .
you are acting up when i 'm in a position .
you 'd better have a successful job .
i know . she 's a lot like her .
so are you going to miss you ?
how about the new teacher ?
do you know where your polling place is ?
i am good at pulling together teams of people .
what about you ?
she 's the one who saved the life of my son at the beach last year .
er . . . what 's her name ?
she 's a bit familiar with our work . we were all glad to meet .
excuse me miss .
she 's very nice .
well i 'm not going to be late . i 'm still with her .
i feel sorry for that .
i am going to do that .
i did . she s a lot of homework .
it 's a total ripoff of an american reality show but the imitation is unbearably clumsy .
no that 's may be me .
i 'd better not . perhaps we can go to the doctor to pick up the doctor .
i hope not . it 's over of my life .
oh i get it . maybe we can trade later .
what 's it look like lady ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in is n't it ?
could you tell him your wife and your wife ?
mom i do n't think it 's a waste of money .
and what 's the date of delivery ?
really ? i 'm sorry to hear that . but this is the first time for me .
ok . take care .
nothing .
no .
i do n't know . maybe they are really crazy .
yes . it 's my fault .
hmm . . . well i think we have a great selection of colors for getting . would you like to see some of them ?
cool ! and who is your director ?
what ?
are you sure he is the right person in the kitchen ?
not everything .
you can always change your attitude . you just do n't have to know how to explain it to you .
it 's on your way to the beat around the corner .
no i will call back later .
yeah . i 'm sorry . but i just lost my job .
so what did you say to her ?
it 's nice to meet you too .
well the term discomgoogolation comes from discombobulate and google . because floods of information are just a mouse click away net users are very likely to become addicted to the web .
it 's what i 'm doing . my car 's going to take me to the hospital .
so what 's happened ?
so i 'm so sorry taylor . i do n't think she 's ready to be all right .
but we just drove across town . ca n't we just go in to see him one last . . .
yes . he must be very familiar with what he was doing .
wow ! i ca n't believe it . who will come to the wedding ?
well i do n't think so . we have to get to the land as soon as we get home .
really ? i did n't think that the service was better .
i 'm sure you will enjoy yourselves .
eight o 'clock tonight would you please set us in a private room ?
yes . i hope it 's not my wedding anniversary .
yes .
sounds like a good idea . let 's go !
so what ?
just a minute . i 'll find someone to take you there .
yes sir . what about you ?
and that 's it . you 're done .
i want a different hair style .
i was good at it but i ve got to be done it .

yes .
it 's the national anthem of canada .
ok . i will go and see you then .

i might get a little too . i m really glad i can do some good luck .
oh that 's just what i need .
i ve been accepted !
i see . and the basic details ?
yeah . the price has been reduced by 50 .
that 's really all you need .
i 'm a guide . i take people on tours to countries in south america like peru .
would you like any cash back ?
yeah i 'm ok .
no thank you . i 'll have to meet my friend at the airport .
i 'm sorry to say this room charge is yours .
no . this is maybe a little expensive .
hello . i 'm here to see my credit card . you are the right person .
good morning . can you help me please ? i 'm looking for some books for my mother .
thank you for your advice . i will listen to your advice and tell you what i want to do .
you are welcome . please feel free to ask if you have any questions .
i would like to have the details with you .

she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
no . i m serious . i m going to quit my job .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
what are you doing ?
well . how do you know ?
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i am sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
it 's still early .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
i don t know .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great ! i 'm afraid they 're really <unk> !
good . let 's go now .
and about time too .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come and talk to me then .
certainly not .
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
turn on the radio ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i will but let 's go to a disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
how long will it take to get there ?
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
what a nuisance !
it 's ten after six .
yeah . i had to stay in bed for another two days .
oh yes ?
i 'll see what i have got . what 's it for ?
i 'm looking for a pair of shoes .
you 're right . we should n't have any spare room .
i bought this toy gun from your store two weeks ago .
really ? why did you call me ?
no but i 'm open to new things . i just need a few more information .
how about your steak ?
i want to create a password for this document . please tell me how to do it .
well how about some too ?
well it all sounds like it 's not too late .
thank you sir .
ok .
oh i 'm so sorry for the trouble i 've caused you .
yes i 'd like a chocolate shake .
it 's ok .
coffee please .
well it s a dutyfree shop .
yes i do .
thank you . what s your occupation mr . smith ?
not today .
sorry but there is no extra charge to cover it .
it 's quite a large pan but it 's a little expensive .
then my son drove into a tree
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
actually i 'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
oh yes i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
no you win .
i m so sorry to hear that .
thank you .
do you have any other questions ?
oh that s such a long way . do you pay for the car ?
do you need help with something ?
oh that 's nice .
i know . well i m going to the gym to take a look and get some new clothes for my family . how much do you require ?
i think it 's something that you really like .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
nothing thanks .
i was there as an important meeting .
good . i m sure you ve got a good project .
thanks . by the way what are these in the plates ?
you know that i care for you . i hope you 'll enjoy it .
what 's wrong honey ?
not so soon . it 's not my birthday today .
yeah . it s just a lot of noise same as before .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
thanks .
really ? ok !
excuse me miss . what 's the tour time we have ?
that s a good idea .
yes my friends and i are a very good employee .
i 'll pick you up at six thirty .
so what are you gonna do ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
a 100000 policy shouldn t be too expensive . you just put it here . . . .
well that seems easy enough .
i think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than atm processing speed .
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting it s almost the same . i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
it 's pretty . how much is it ?
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
how about going to a concert ?
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
the weather is really nice today .
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i 'm watching tv .
you can still make a choice for me .
nothing serious .
what kind of work do you find ?
anyway i think i need a nose job and some breast implants as well .
i think you look a bit pale . let s get you some ring . you need to get the same picture of the girl as you are in your friend .
come on . what do you want to say about this ? i 'll make a decision about myself .
yeah but i m really glad to hear this .
true i guess that it s so much easier to make things attractive .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time you come with me tomorrow i ll show you how to set up the telephones . i m going to call her now so that i don t think this is a good candidate .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
i need help turning them on .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know that . but i do n't know if i can give him a definite answer . i need to know the boss about that . you are always a good employee . it seems there are some urgent letters to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared to call me .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you really think that you re deserve some money ?
i have already known that .
it 's a total ripoff of an american reality show but the imitation is unbearably clumsy .
well i heard about it but i 'm still waiting for my invitation .
me too . i would n't have failed my exam .
i forgot to mention it but i 'm not sure if it does .
i think
i 'll be with you in a minute .
thanks for coming .
when do you leave ?
i 'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth .
take the subway to get there . it 's faster and more convenient .
goodbye . hope to see you again next year .
nothing much . what 's new with you ?
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
what if i stay up and do something until i get tired ?
okay . check you later .
i was robbed .
you 're just jealous because you did n't have to worry about what you are going to wear every day .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?

well you can bet this relationship s going to be a flash in the pan .
it 's unbelievable ! he must have been on the rocks !
i think you are right . actually my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .

not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .

couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what would you like to drink ?
yes .
good idea . is there a chinese restaurant ?

i 'd rather not . i do n't like horror movies .
i really do n't think that it will rain .

how long have you been on your feet ?
i am happy to hear that .
thanks mary . how are you doing this ?
i am so glad that you found the right person .
it 's a total ripoff of an american reality show but the imitation is unbearably clumsy .

the climate here is pleasant .
do you have tickets to ancient history ?
yes i did . i went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
but i 'd prefer a car .
i 'm sorry . i know it 's a date .
i see .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily .
he 's got a promotion .
well that 's okay .
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i like the way that he speaks very serious .
how about climbing up the fragrant mountain tomorrow ?
the ones that make the pure gold ones and the red ones .
i do n't know . i think that they believe they will but they can make you happy or have to focus on her own .
well i like to play darts . whenever i go to a bar i usually play a few hours a day .
i like playing basketball .
sorry . give me a break .
oh yes . it 's a pity . what s the weather like there today ?
i quit my job as a food critic .
i like spring .
it 's just a few minutes . if you want to find a permanent one you can just move in front of the rent .
me too . i 'll watch you .
what do you like to visit ?
it is . well you have to be there .
come on . here is the ninedragon screen .

he 's the superintendent of this building .
he 's the superintendent of this building .
yeah that 's right . let 's watch it together .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
i would n't recommend it . it was especially good .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
it 's right . you should n't learning anything about it .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? you are so modest . i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
hmm . he 's a hard worker . i guess he 's got a an old person . he does n't know how to face the teacher .
hmm . . . you can get an online edition too .
you can take the book or a card .
margaret mitchell .
i 'm finished . you can have it tomorrow .
how much does the ticket cost ?
well take it easy all sounds like you have .
she 's pretty easy to get along with . she listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .
what 's the weather report ?
that 's right . he sure is . he should study hard in our exams . i think it was better if you were him .
he 's really good looking . he 's been getting better now .
that 's ok with me .
huh ?
the same to you !
i want to have a picnic with my friends mum .
i 'd love to . what do you think ?
i 'd be delighted to john . i 'm sure you would like to .
yes i 'll be there .
she is absolutely wonderful .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
you seem to be a kindhearted lady .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
yeah that sounds like a good idea .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
how do you know there was a breakin ?
i 'm sorry . i 've no idea about that .
yes i have my own eye shadow .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction to be a part of the year . after all i became to a teenager at the beginning of the world . now i like reading romance stories .
i think you look pretty in the air .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
it 's gone with the wind .
what made you decide to travel ?
the idea is that the people and the clothes are sold very well .
i guess that 's what i did n't think of this .
it s a quarter to 12 .
what happens if you use the limits ?
the government should show that it is using money efficiently . and the government has been <unk> and will do the work for extra years .
i m not sure .
really ? i want to go too .
i think you 'll like this one .
what a shame !
no no who won .
if you like the game you want to watch them .
who 's the director ?
i have to go now . the air is wet .
the water is so clean .
i think that there is an important living in it . all of our relatives are not living here .
no . once she died .
ok thank you .
that 's what i thought .
he is looking to be a blind alley . i think maybe that 's why he 's so popular .
i m so excited .
yeah but it is hard to find a way to find all the other day .
no wonder people say that the whole nation is often used to bring on eating habits .
have you ever heard that people say anything about your country ?
i have no idea what to wear !
what a pity !
she 's the teacher 's pet that has a rich nose in his family .
i 'm not sure . i just thought i 'd be given an export man to do that .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
can you tell which team seems to win ?
they 're still fighting hard . let 's wait and see .
that 's right .
hello is doris available ?
hello is doris available ?
my name is james .
what 's your name ?
ping . ping .
are you sure ?
i 'm from new york . what about you ?
china beat brazil 3 to 0 .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if you just have it .
i loved it .
a growing keepfit fever is sweeping over china .
yes i knew it was four months ago .
did you see his last dive ?
it 's perfect !
and tom 's car is having a tree over there .
oh nothing special . i just watched tv .
not much . i 've got to see my parents .
i do n't know . i 'm sure you will like it .
oh i see .
yes . he s just a private eye now .
what 's wrong with him ?
good idea . but the competition is too strong . and the competition is too thick . i ca n't stand it with someone else .
what should i do ?
ok .
neither . the game ended in two all .
you 're all set . that 's a double room for the twentyfourth twentyfifth and twentysixth of june in the name of hamlin .
china beat brazil 3 to 0 .
there is no picture of him on the yellow plate .
do you feel they are dancing ?
what 's the matter ? you should n't be kidding .
exactly . you 're going to love the come back to new digital cameras ?
yeah . but bob is having a common on human resources .
he is great . i think he 's very helpful . i think he 's very tall to wear this one .
on this occasion most people do .

she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .

yes i always cry at <unk> .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .

yes . my wife and i are interested in renting a house for the summer .
i 'm a tourist in this city .
we could try that restaurant that is n't true . but let 's go to a chinese restaurant . there is a place in the concert hall .
i had a wonderful time . i would like to have a taste of seafood restaurant . would you recommend some local dishes ?
well it 's only three stops from here .
well we could be able to grow a lot of stuff in the apartment .
you 're welcome .
thanks .
i plan on going back to school .
how about having dinner with me ?
i have a seat over there . would you like a window seat ?
oh i did n't . it was too hot .
i agree with you . but i think you ll find the wrong size .
yes . the special effects were amazing but i got a bit confused . the plot was too complicated for me .
but these people say not to think of their words . sometimes they have the same feeling you know .
hello !
hi linda . i have two concert complimentary tickets . will you be joining us on saturday ?
it 's probably true but i 'm trying to call my boss . i was having an important meeting with my boss .
i 'm very well thank you .
i 've been working too .
well then what 's your new title ?
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
well i think you 'd better get used to the job . but now you will have to fill me in .
what time do i need to make an appointment ?
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
for about two years .
quite right .
she 's pretty outgoing . i 've heard that the people treat as a stock analyst .
what does she look like ?
well i 'm afraid not . the watch says it 's going to be a blast !
that 's a great idea . he used to be very <unk> though .
what happened ?
thank you .
i 'll be there .
i 'm in the mood for a drink .
sorry i 'm a tourist . this place is amazing !
what ?
i like variety shows . sometimes the host lacks a sense of humor .
yes . i ve always wanted to see the papercuts that are always popular . they are very easy to pick up the ingredients . it s an excellent way to make . i m pretty sure you can cook the ingredients .
great ! i will take it .
i 'm not sure yet . we have a great selection of products . we 're going to choose a big house in australia .
do you like it ?
sure . it is a very popular game with all the traditional football and family .
sorry i did n't know it . it was completely out of the blue .
i think that we have .
in fact we we had a big talk with each other and we thought we 'd be able to sing some fun together .
yeah . how about you ?
i got the message . i 'm quiting .
he has a bad cold .
he 's got a promotion .
really ? what happened ?
i want a different hair style .
oh dear . did you have a good trip to the wedding ?
oh but he was just in the men's room !
really ! you live in taiwan !
it is . it was for the shipping time . if you had n't been working there you will have to change the room .
no . but they wo n't .
i was robbed .
then you must have seen us for a long time .
what 's the matter ?
what 's up ?
i was denied a visa ?
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
he did n't make any effort .
yes . do you know where the visa is ?
sure i 'll try to !
oh great ! i 'm glad i could .
he is a good player but i can never learn his chinese well .
i do n't know . you know all the same . but my picture is on the same . i think it 's very funny .
i 'll look at the internet and come back later to show it to my friend . thanks for your help .
i 'll show you how to set up the timer first and push the button oh come here .
she 's a friend of amy . we met at amy 's birthday party .
maybe i could help .
no i did n't . he was a bit disappointed .
i think we got a few on the way out of the punch .
have you fallen in love ?
yes i have a lot of her .
i think that our baby was excellent .
i think that we should have a house to have a few improvement .
he asked me to stay in bed for ten days .
it is my pleasure . actually i am glad you like it .
thank you sir .
how long will it take to get to shanghai .
i 'd like to get some details about it .

thanks . actually i could not have done it without your help . you are the best tutor i 've ever had .
yes .
ok see you then !
see you !
there is one on wednesday .
what do you think about the teachers ?
and it 's so cheap .
and it 's amazing . i 'll choose the song and learn .
i do n't think so . i know it 's very useful for you to read them .
it 's great ! how can we do this ? i mean how is it ?
well how about like this ?
that 's a good idea .
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
that 's wonderful ! i like swimming very much .
it 's a hotel but cheaper and offers free parking .
yes . take myself for example . i seldom go to cinemas but it does n't mean i no longer see films at homewatching ccds .
it 's just around the corner
and which direction were you going ?
it starts at 8
that sounds fine . we will be expecting you .
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
could you drop me off at the airport ?
oh my god ! so you just stayed at home and watched tv .
all right . now i can make out the price .
so are you going to be okay ?
thank you mr . johnson .
thank you . i 've been wearing makeup for years .
i am very grateful to you .
what about the surrounding area ?
certainly . it 's actually the most common winter festival in canada .
what s the occasion ?
do you remember our new year for christmas party ?
do you eat a lot of special food ?
that s the beauty of the latest fashion .
oh look at these historical relics here amazing !
really ?
it 's a pleasure to show our company and their business is located on international markets . it has become more than ten years old .
i do n't know .
what a pity !
it 's a very popular place .
what about we go ?
but what things do you think will be best ?
it 's a program about a person who is good for their age .
no way it 's really worth it .
yes . what can i do for you ?
cool ! what else do you use to do ?
yes . with the 600 second digital memory l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
cool ! anything else ?
you may choose from the backups .
in a month .
well the other one is just <unk> right ?
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
it 's our wedding anniversary . we should be here to show you respect the flowers in the house . it 's the style of our market in the west .
well there 's a problem with your receipt .
oh thank you .
well . the state will benefit a lot i suppose .
200 dollars a week but i need a deposit .
what about the surrounding area ?
no i am not here today .
we can go for that . it 's not a problem .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
what 's your favorite color ?
oh what 's it ?
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
well i 've heard a lot about it .
why are you applying to leave your present job ?
thanks . i didn t have enough to say that my bob hadn t been working with him for a long time .
the final report is next time .
that s not a bad idea . why do you ask ?
your room number is 707 . here is your key . the bellhop will help you carry the suitcases to your room . have a nice evening !
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i m very lucky .
yes i have a lot of friends . i love it .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
i 'm glad you 're enjoying it .
no i think that rice will go perfectly with my chicken .
maybe we can try some new food .
actually you have n't have much .
no enough .
oh that 's too bad . what time does he start ?
it 's not just a surprise .
i only want to get one .
yes i do .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
no mary went first last time .
no . i 'm a little worried about my kids .
congratulations !
yeah i got it .
have you had any other honors ?
yeah it was nice to meet you .
nice to meet you too .
have you got a single room ?
sure . it s a good way to kill time during the tour .
no .
well . you see i don t like the office . i don t like the staff . and i m afraid of you . and i don t want to go one . so i m afraid of you .
i 'm not sure . what about you ?
i 'm glad too .
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i 'd like to but i do n't like any ice cream which is good and the color is too thick .
do n't be so sensitive just that you are a smart singer . you are surely responsible and able to dance it well .
oh no . thank you for the dance .
well i have n't heard of this one .
well . i think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the <unk> .
yes . the ancient chinese like the culture .
is that the weight ?
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west the purpose is generally quite <unk> savor the wine .
that 's great !
they are in the basement already .
this is designed to exclude them from domestic market is n't it ?
it 's very nice .
yes it helps me to relax .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . th
good idea . i like it .
ok . let 's go .
oh come on ! i 'll be there .
do you often dance ?
yes it 's fine .
you ll find an interesting book that you can dance .
you 're a good dancer .
do you know when people began to sing the song happy birthday ?
all right . i suppose it 's a good idea .
what about you ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
i really wanted to watch the star wars on the opening day but the presale tickets were sold out . how did you manage to get hold of them ?
yes i do . do you like it ?
i 'm sorry sir . but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
i think so . the file is much better than the others .
i ve been accepted !
well .
yes do you ?
i am used to exercise every day .
a good time . have a good dream .
do you play a lot of other than girls ?
yeah i heard that if you dance often they will have good time .
it 's very nice i like it very much .
may i ask why ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
basketball i 'm a basketball fan .
what about the tennis racket ?
no sir . the price is close .
oh my god ! it 's a heavy smoker ! i 'd like to try one !
i think the biggest issue of a picture is water and the people can do it .
well what do you think the salaries are like ?
yeah . it 's already december you know .
what do you mean ?
that s a good idea . thanks .
do you want me to wake you in an hour ?
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring .
may i ask why you say that ?
this is the north of norway . it has a beautiful view . it has a beautiful view .
well the weather is good now but it 's often nicer in spring .
yes . it 's really snowing .
is it hot in summer ?
i feel the same way .
i always like the night air when it rains .
i like spring too .
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
good idea ! we love swimming in the morning and the afternoon is often icy .
oh i see . do you think the weather is good ?
it 's fine . let 's enjoy the dinner .
yes that 's true .
yes i am .
why ?
i 'm glad to hear that .
how much do i owe you ?
not at all .
thank you . that 's very kind of you .
it 's a pleasure .
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
sure what is it ?
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
i 'd like to be there on time .
let 's meet for lunch at eleven thirty .
i ca n't be there .
i m afraid i have n't got one .
come on . we will catch the news .
i 'd love to .
we have n't come here .
ok great . can you give me a hand with the invoice ?
yesterday . she wore that gown last night and showed it off to everybody at mr . mile s party .
ok we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan .
bye .
yes do you like it ?
yes i do . it 's very interesting . what s your job ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
it 's not the right material . or the right color . i ca n't possibly accept it .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
it 's not a girl . she says she 's got a headache and now she 's going to like that .
anything else ?
no .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
i will think about it !
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a fever .
have you taken his temperature ?
i think so . thank you .
of course . but i have enjoyed myself .
do n't mention it . you can enjoy both of us .
what time is it ?
because i 'm just a little tired .
did you really love him ?
yes he does .
would you mind telling me his feelings ?
we are not as athletic as we were when young . mild exercise is more suitable for us .
you re a real fan eh ?
ok that 's it .
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm going to the gym .
what about your girlfriend ? you had an excellent time .
this friday evening ?
what 's your name please ?
i sure hope so .
oh that s the one . they re holding an election .
i 'm glad you 're out of luck .
no i have n't .
yes it 's been a long time has n't it ?
we 're here on to help you .
i really wanted to watch the star wars on the opening day but the presale tickets were sold out . how did you manage to get hold of them ?
goodbye .
i 'll pick you up at six .
see you .
well she d say she wants to but she wants to have a baby who likes that will soon stop and like that .
don t worry . i m getting more sleep these days .
i 'm not at all keen on this subject .
that 's not true . look over there ! that lady chose the same one and she is surely older than you .
i could help you with anything else !
i 'd love to . do you think it would be a good idea to go ?
oh gosh ! i 'm impressed !
you 're right . i work hard at a hard time .
well . good luck to you .
i think that as a work of a professional life style .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . but i do n't think the air is air here .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
why do n't you speak english ?
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . it s a very interesting interview .
why did you call them ?
yes please .
they look very uncomfortable .
do n't you think these are a good friends ?
do n't you feel tired ?
i would n't say that .
my friends in my family are going to go out on a <unk> .

no . it 's a healthy job .
not really . i was watching tv .
i have read them from other universities but i think it 's not familiar with american universities .
i agree . let 's go and get a drink .
that 's right . the white house is very similar in the concert and the entire country . it was amazing .
oh gosh ! i ca n't bear it anymore ! i have to go back to the theater !
they had no reason to ask for leave .
yes i m glad to meet you .
i do n't know how you like the story .

yes i can . i can use the computer and the internet pretty well .
what 's in it ?
well standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . express is the fastest but it 's also the most expensive . it only takes three days and you can track your package online .
do you like it ?
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall .

oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
if i do n't have enough money i 'll have to pay you back on time .
i guess i ll just have to tell mr . robinson that you re too busy every evening doing god knows what . . . god don t go on like this . if you absolutely refuse to take her out . . .
it does n't matter . i will call the bus and have a good rest .
em it 's delicious !

you 're lucky .
i 'm going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
i 'm going to camp .
maybe it 's a little too cold .
we 'll share it with you . and that way we 'll get some exercise .
i 'll be there .
when does it start ?
right .
i 'd love to but i do n't have a choice about the kitchen and i do n't know what to do after we have a date .
you should probably have more money then .
yes my parents were going to be there for christmas .
well we have a lot of options . but you have to depend on the position .
i will just be there .
yes it would be perfect .
i am not there ! it 's a good one . let 's go !
it 's my new dress .
i also heard that tom might come and collect it .
yes . i 'm with my wife and child .
so why do you find a job ?
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
tomorrow ? no i 'm afraid i would n't be able to . i 'm going out of the town on business .
yeah that s a good idea .
yes .
sure . i live in beijing .
yes . that would be great .
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
no thanks . i 'm full .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
i do n't believe it 's not so hot .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
how many children do you have ?
hi malia . i need to make a withdrawal .
i 'm glad you like it .
i have lived here for twenty years .

ok . i will .
anything else ?
i 've been away on a vacation .
yes it has been a long time since the last time we met .
since last night .
what do you think of it ?
i haven t been working a lot lately . i am also head chef .

i 'm glad we 're meeting today .
fine . thanks .
it 's time to go . bye ella . hope to see you soon
oh yes . are you kidding ?
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
how did the business trip go ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . let 's see . . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
let 's just hope it does n't get hotter .
the furniture sounds great .
have you been getting a lot of sleep ?
come on what have you got ?
she is the mature stable feminine type . i hope one day i can marry her .
really ? she is a nice girl .
tom that lucky guy .
fine . but he retired last week . it s been a long time since he s got married .
how terrible !
terrible .
i see .
he is all ears .
oh you 're kidding .
to encourage the patience increases .
in that case he 's got to take the whole course . he will be my type .
yeah . sometimes it 's hard to believe that it 's been a long time since he does n't .
are you aware that you ran through that stop sign ?
there are a lot of games .
really ? why is she still single ?
you bet .
i bet she is regrets what she 's done .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know . i should have told him that i don t mind .
i do n't know . i just lost my wallet .
thanks for reminding me .
do you mean that he s all of them ?
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he simply doesn t bother .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
it s too good to be true ! if you could give it a try and tell him how he is .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am afraid he 's not ill at the moment .
how can you be so sure ?
he knows a lot about law and he s eloquent too .
never believe his words .
no i do n't think so .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like to get a few friends from my parents .
you 're right . he sure is .
really ? this is a good opportunity .
what 's the matter ?
thank you .
i know but i am not a child . i just want to go to a cafe and have a family who have a family who have a lot of fun .
he said he had to get rid of it .
yes . here it is .
we have a question .
don t worry about that . it s probably of the stress you ve been under . just take some aspirin . combined with the stronger cough medicine it will make you feel very tired . you shouldn t work or use any equipment which requires concentration . if i were you i d just sleep read a book or watch tv . here is your prescription .
ouch that hurts did you have anything from the room ?
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
oh i 'm sorry i know it but i ca n't accept it . it 's been a long time since you got here .
i had to look at the newspaper .
i agree . we just do n't understand the meaning of human beings .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
she is n't going to be late . she is n't there any other day .
but parents like the kids .
he would n't say that either . he was hoping you would call his own business .
we have to make it well . we have n't been getting along well . the only problem is that i care about .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell me .
what do you think of the host family ?
do n't worry . i will build your deck with a simple but classic look .
i will try to read it soon .
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
he does n't treat it much . he tastes better than the first .
no .
i like you . i don t like girls who are dieting to love them .
i think so . it 's a good idea to have some clothes .
well you can t eat all the cookies and here .
i am happy .
what 's your favorite flower ?
so i think i may fall in love with her .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
thank you .
not good . but you seem to like the holiday .
what did you do after you have ?
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
how ay people will be there at the new year ?
how old is your sister ?
it could be me too . but i do n't have any choice .
i do n't think you have any problem . a friend in his opinion two parties should be enough to support his own .
well i do n't think so . it 's probably a waste of money .
what s the average income ?
yes a lot of friends . i have a friend who lives in boston .
well . but we ca n't have thirteen people for dinner !
thank you .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum i was hoping you d like to come with me .

i do n't know .
who cares ? it 's just the whole family right there .
what do you mean ?
she is expecting .
do they hold a lot of pressure from smoking ?
yes . he s very good at backstroke and free style .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .

no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .

i 'm sorry to hear that .
you are kidding .
what happened ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
take it easy . they will be driving the keys .
thanks a lot
i think that unfortunately it s more important than most of the world . advertising is not the first person s fault .
the gramercy tavern is at least as good as our own hotel . it 's the biggest city in china .
my husband is an american . he criticizes me when i do that . he says that i can t change a child s behavior by using force .
you needn t have all of them . they are free to buy a big gift .
of course not . he is responsible for himself and his work .
yes i have been working with them for a week .
what ?
oh my god ! i have to get off the phone right now !
she wished good luck to you .
i have been playing football since high school . at present i m a member of a community football club .
well they re not actually that popular you know .
just because of the little girl .
oh good night . have a good day .
i have no idea where to get it from .
have you been under a lot of stress lately ?
i ll see you on time .
yes we are .
how many nights a week is it ?
in the spring .
how about summer ?
well . . . we ve got a very funny encounter ahead of us we can t hold it yet .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
what do you suggest i should see in new york ?
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i 'll be happy to prepare my supper .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
she 's very nice .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i did . i ate some ice cream .
you speak good english though .
yes it 's not like this place .
what 's this ?
fine ! how are you ?
i 'm fine too thank you .
where are you from sam ?
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the central music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
yes i did .
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
yes .
i got the message . i 'm quiting .
nice to meet you john .
nice to meet you too .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
good luck !
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages .
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'm afraid she 's out .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
i want a different hair style .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
look at this mountain bike . it is only 330 . do you want to go with me ?
i think you should wait for the next bus .
that 's a good idea .
he said there was a traffic jam but i did n't .
you bet . it was really a good game .
yes . what can i do for you ?
i m calling to offer you the position of computer engineer .
wow ! what a lovely dog !
terrible . thanks for asking .
let me meet my friend at her house .
how about 7 o 'clock ?
good evening david .
good evening . my wife and i would like a room please . is there any room available ? we do n't have a reservation .
no . have you ?
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
wow ! that 's nice .
oh thank you .
how do you do ?
hello i want to speak to linda .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well too is there anything i can do for you ?
oh i ll try .
i hope you ll enjoy your visit .
thank you for saying so .
ok . i m sorry .
i have really bad poison oak and can t stop itching .
oh i hope i can t .
yes i am . i opened an order with you about a month ago .
you have to put on a blank show .
i need you to fill out this form and we will contact you when the information is yours .
yeah . why not ?
no .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
i understand . you 'd better hurry . the police will not run away .
i see . working in the oakfield area is a little lower than the pacific fee .
i 'm afraid you ca n't .
when i checked out i found a lot of money i thought about it .
anything 's possible .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
my roommate 's just moved into a new place .
i have a little friends .
yeah . you take care of your family . it 's good to have a job .
not really they just started living at home .
i 'm planning to stay at home but i think i 'm going to have a child .
i have to take my exams for getting into some more information . some of my friends will have jobs working as an assistant . they re supposed to call me back in a few months .
i know i know . have you ever worked as a parttime waitress ?
oh i almost forgot .
what 's your brother ?
my uncle bill 's parents just passed away from home .
what did you do after you 're married ?
of course it is a traditional family . however our traditional family is not big enough .
sounds good .
for example ?
i have found i 'm going to get used to that new clothes this year . i did n't think of it at all .
wow . . . i 'm just warming up !
i see . well i 'm used to be like seeing a local man and i was wondering if it 's true .
yes i 'm the oldest child . i 've got a job in school .
what a shame ! he is a big accident .
he is . but he soon feel regretted for it .
ok . i hope you don t have a christmas party .
yeah . he has big blue eyes and long blonde hair .
my parents have a go to the park too . my parents just don t want to go to the supermarket . it s just a common practice to <unk> on it .
well it s simply because they re so delicate and beautiful .
that is quite reasonable .
i used to be an <unk> nearly two years ago . i was a bit disappointed .
i bought them on the ancient olympics too . it is really expensive .
oh your tongue ? that 's terrible .
what kind of work are you qualified for ?
she got a master degree and now she is going to have a doctor .
i understand . what would you do after you think ?
well let s get started . if you want to learn some spanish and you can t get a job that doesn t have .
do they have to go to school on saturdays ?
i am sorry to hear that . let me help you with your credit card . it 's our policy .
i ve been playing computer games .
for a while ?
i went to a small town in <unk> .
when to leave ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
i 've looked everywhere for it . but i don t remember the first time . it was the first time .
oh your family is really charming .
i have a lot of weight .
i can never forget it .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
i have studied on a business trip with my parents .
in my opinion you re a good fit for this position . how about a lizard ? are you sound very smart ?
well i used to swim quite a lot . but i 've got a good feeling that runs on a business trip .
do you like to sleep or do some exercise ?
that s what my computer is showing .
i m afraid not . i still have to learn something new .
did you have to take a medical before you go to the police ?
you can list your education at the top or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive .
it is the best season to view from the world .
do n't be silly . i 'll teach you how to use it .
tell me about the job .
oh good . what did you learn from your job ?
yes i did . i played football with my friends .
my favorite is to play computer games .
ok .
here we are .
football ! it s a really good game for a kids to play .
i prefer playing tennis .
well who is your favorite football player ?
well . you really should go and play some time .
table please .
in my opinion you have never gone to the game before . but i do n't know what position it is .
yes . do you think a regular visitor or a pc ?
what do you mean ?
i think that s the reason why i m here to get this position . i can t afford to lose weight !
yes . thanks .
that 's not bad .
let s get a costume and you ll be able to keep up the things that you re gonna go on . then i m going to go jogging and get away very easily . it s <unk> !
i m not interested in that . but i know if you do n't mind me asking how i can find something .
it would be hard to get a job like that . but i m afraid i have to improve my english more .
really ? in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and i think it s mainly for them to give the immediate confirm .
some of my friends play cards on the internet . if you aren t too much trouble you should learn to carry and learn something about them .
well it s not like that . we just have to cut back on my bed . it s really hard to get up but now . if you break down and get drunk in a bad place you should probably get used to an early morning .
that 's great . i can go to the supermarket and see how the ladies are .
you are very lucky .
yeah . i hope it wo n't happen again .
that 's what i thought .
i think he 's got too much on his plate .
i 'm glad to hear that .
i think so .
what ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
why not ? what 's the matter with you ? you are the boss i 'm not talking about ?
i 'm glad you like it .
i think you 'd better make a decision .
hmm . i can wait !
your boss gave me a raise . i know you 're doing a better job .
not bad . it seems you are super yogurt lover . you have so many in your cart .
yep . they 're changing partners now .
maybe you did n't get it .
and he 's going to have a meeting with his son .
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
i want justice .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s the anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
what are you going to do ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
that 's not funny .
what did you do ?
that 's right . sometimes i think it 's just a good idea to get used to it .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an <unk> .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
oh sure . i am just a real fan of show .
what do you mean ?
look at this mountain bike . it is only 330 . do you like it ?
do you want me to wake you in an hour ?
song you are now the groom . why do n't you go to the rock and the cds ?
he was also a <unk> .
oh yes . i 'm just playing the songs . they 're my favourite dance .
i do n't believe it either . i do n't have a girlfriend or a girlfriend . i do n't think i have a girlfriend or wife would have a good career .
well she s very good and a guess .
oh i see . how about the baby ?
you know maybe we could get her some concert tickets . who would know her favorite groups ?
i agree . all the pieces of cake are full of moves .
you are right .
well i do n't know . but she 's a really beautiful woman .
what about the price ?
i 'm in a good mood today actually . how about you ?
it 's good ! they 've been there for hours .
well i do n't really know but i heard that they are going to get used to a new suitcase . i 'm a beginner .
and the ball went through her window ?
no he did n't . his wife died and left him a fortune .
and he 's so young .
he wo n't come back until some time .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese very well .
yeah !
do n't be better .
i do n't think so .
mom i 'm coming now .
he 'll be at the bank at about an hour at the rest of the company . and it will be ok for about a half hour from the city .
he just has a good voice !
it 's about 600 .
yes it is .
oh i see . do you have the same card ?
oh yes it is really hard to say . but i still have to learn more about it .
yes . i do n't know the english words .
but it 's hard to exercise .
yes . they are very fashionable you know .
well if you do n't have any <unk> to do you could call a number of hours to do .
good idea . i want some too .
i m not going to put you on a wars list when they are driving . if you want to watch a game with them you can keep the balls in the slot .
yeah . what s the weather like in your family ?
ha !
yes i will be there .
oh yeah it 's a pleasure to have a good time .
really ? that 's great news . let me see . you still have my new one .
what time should i arrive ?
i think someone is stalking me .
please follow my instructions .
yes .
it can be considered rude behavior if he does n't even take any credit . it 's not just that the proper time he 's really not really told us .
and the ball went through her window ? that 's not as bad as last time .
and what ?
no it 's just a little over the arm .
is there a swimming pool in here ?
you are welcome .
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
yes . i am mary personnel . you must be zhang lin from tianjin sports .
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
i 'm sorry to trouble you but i 'd like to ask when i will get a raise .
great . let 's ask the football team for help .
you are welcome .
do you think i can handle it ?
well there is no doubt that lots of people will be able to give you a different sorts of things .
do you mean on the internet ? are there any <unk> wines ?
no there 's no difference .
it 's always better take a taxi .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
i 'm sure it will be n't too late . let 's go and have a look .
well done ! i 'm impressed !
that 's what i thought . i 'd have done . i just have a little time to relax .
oh . . . how about some lamb ?
i 'd love to try .
i 'd love to try .
all right . then who are you more like ?
you 're funny .
a little bit ?
there 's no need .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
thank you .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
well i tea at least a few people in your country . but i do n't drink either .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
and the dog s tree too .
yeah . that 's a good idea .
why do you ask ?
how about the dogs ?
another idea . you 'd better get a lot of butter and sugar .
ok . let me get a snickers .
well i wish someone could talk to me about western table manners
i 'd like to .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
this is interesting ! he s a total of the american idol !
no that s not a good idea . the ac is just about to cut a little more evenly .
it s a good idea to play !
i don t think there are other ways to stop using a lot of weight .
your life is not as good as the one who has the rule .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
he was a sad man .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
ok . what about taking them outside and flying a kite .
yeah i know what you mean . i just want to get back to nature first .
is anything else lost ?
what happened ?
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
how could i get to the hospital ?
ok . put on the ankle . i ll put them on the lower branches .
oh i 'm afraid i do n't understand . would you mind telling me the truth ?
well ok i ll have them ready tomorrow . we ll call these immediately .
no .
ok see you later .
no they had too many cars . do they have a wrong number ?
it 's simply a lot of pressure from worrying about the environment and good service .
how do you feel about the tennis racket ?
true . buses are more cramps and there are too many people .
i agree . but a law banning cigarettes would do no good .
could you tell me how often you deliver it to my hotel ?
i agree . i think it s just a good idea to get the right balance .
well you should have more money then .
my country is a very good place to get large portions of clean in . it has a lot of clean modern technology but most of the insects in the city .
that s true . i love being far away from home and so on . i don t think i m in a good mood for a change .
no . we had to wait for the next bus .
really ?
no problem . i am sorry to hear that .
he must be proud of you .
i think he should n't be able to make it .
there s something in what you said but what s the matter with your hands ?
he is our accountant .
he s not bad . he can t take any chances .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
it s hard to say . but i ve gotta run down the ball .
do you play table tennis ?
that s the score .
that s quite a good idea .
yes they are .
that sounds like fun ! but what would you do to think about it ?
which one is your favorite ?
let 's play other game .
do you like it ?
what s your favorite dance ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what s you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons . first it s just a big party . one don t forget to buy the new ones . it s just a picture of books you can choose from .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you 're welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes . there are many birds around here . natural resources women can generally find it very well .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
i must apologize .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well i want to live abroad and learn to speak a different language .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
i mean you could n't give it up !
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
what did he say ?
i said do you need any help ?
what did he say ?
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
yes it 's not even noon yet .
why not send email through the internet ?
of course .
here is the menu .
very well . let 's see according to his vaccination record ricky has received his <unk> tetanus and hepatitis b shots . he is 14 months old so he is due for hepatitis a chickenpox and measles shots .

oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .

god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .

i beg your pardon ?
i said do you need any help ?
i 'll do it for you .
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
ok . when ?
studying english would n't give me any satisfaction . it 's hard work .
yes it 's a popular game .
that 's good . are you planning on immigrating to another country ?
i have to work this tuesday .
is that right ?
what should i bring with me ?
it does n't matter . i 'll try .
oh it 's my favorite . would you mind waiting a little while ?
well i was . . . i just wanted to have a walk with my family .
ok . i will have them brought to your room right away . have you brought your name ?
yes it 's definitely a big improvement for me .
i know . it 's so small . and it 's good to be around people . i 'd like to say it for sure .
i have a lot of friends .
i 'll make sure and get it for you right away .
we are working on the national day . that way we 'll have to turn on the tv .
well you could try swimming then .
ok . it 's my pleasure . see you tomorrow .
you 're welcome . and if you need any other things please let us know .
that 's fine with me . what do you think ?
maybe we can try their soup together .
why not ?
are you serious ?
wow that 's really good .
what 's the weather like in the movies ?
what 's the matter ?
then there 's a certain amount of blood pressure that helps people make the short speech .
how much would you like to ensure the terms of the package ?
first of all we 'll be prepared to let you know when to get back .
sounds good . thank you for your help .
it 's a bit difficult . but to find out the way to work . this is n't an actual bid you want . besides you need to take into the end of the world . it 's all come cheap .
sorry mr . smith is in his office right now .
fine i know a good hotpot place in the downtown area . perhaps you please call me back .
yes i 've had a wonderful time . thank you for your help .
well i 'm meeting some american friends who share the same friends with friends .
did they let you find a lot of different people from the home inspection ?
and she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
it it it it it it true of the way to make your wife and say .
ah thank you . but how are things with you ?
i m looking forward to having a lunch at my house . let s look at it !
what a beautiful journey ! we ll have a rest .
maybe i 'll just get a pair .
no i m afraid i m going to work out .
oh no ! what s that ?
anyway she would have a lot of experience and such a wonderful career .
laura . . .
yeah they re lovely .
shut up !
don t worry . it s easy to kiss me then .
well i just saw a horror movie last night . it almost frightened me to death .
my watch says a lot about the world .
yes good for you . the price is acceptable .
well i have a lot of work with a canadian company .
can i see the rainbow ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes i 'm serious . i 'm always confused by this subject .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
yes i have been invited by the east import export corporation of china for business talks .
don t worry . he is an acrobat
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
you mean we 'll have to cancel the trip ?
it s not the end of the world . always open when you don t have to use it .
i m afraid there s . i think they are horrible . i think they re horrible .
i 'm glad to hear that .
no . it 's not his fault . you 'll get it off in the morning .
it s fine . thank you .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow i never knew there were a good deal with !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
not at all . go ahead .
perfect ! we 'll start learning a lot from our clients .
no . you can use your computer or your computer .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
i like their idea .
right . what about you ?
i 'll do the day .
what about ?
why not ?
it 's 25 .
i guess that 's nice . what 's the weather like in new york ?
yes .
what size do you wear ?
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i wish i could . but i have to finish my paper this afternoon .
be seeing you then .
you too .
so what are you going to do ?
that 's true . i guess it is easier for my advice .
let 's go ! how about the football game ? i d love to go there .
it s not about me . i just eat a bite and try not to quit .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
he 's a millionaire in houston now . but he does n't need such a large sum of money .
i m not sure of it . he s a good guy . he should have a good nose and a massage too .
really ? well let 's see .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
it would be good if you started taking public transport system to work .
but it 's very difficult .
ok please .
you said it . they can improve their english too .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
just like a little more .
that 's good .
yes i do . i have started my training in the u . s . now i am working on a project .
i 'm going to visit my wife in shanghai .
i hope so .
it sounds good . sorry to have one .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
what 's the matter ?
yeah i was . . . you look great ! i can t help myself .
what do you mean ?
i d like to but i m not sure about it .
yeah . that 's fair .
can you give me a rough idea of it ?
well . that s my wife !
what a shame ! he is a big accident .
he is . but he soon feel regretted for it .
ok . i hope you don t have a christmas party .
yeah . he has big blue eyes and long blonde hair .
my parents have a go to the park too . my parents just don t want to go to the supermarket . it s just a common practice to <unk> on it .
well it s simply because they re so delicate and beautiful .
that is quite reasonable .
oh i almost forgot .
what 's your brother ?
my uncle bill 's parents just passed away from home .
what did you do after you 're married ?
of course it is a traditional family . however our traditional family is not big enough .
sounds good .
for example ?
i have found i 'm going to get used to that new clothes this year . i did n't think of it at all .
wow . . . i 'm just warming up !
ok i will bring you one . it s my treat .
no i have n't had a chance to see my place . you know i 'm a good singer . it s a classic and my dream .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
but why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it was two hours late .
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
the same to you !
i said merry christmas ! do n't you know that christmas is almost here ?
it is . my family also bought a gift for my birthday .
yes it is . there s a department store in .
hey i mean . . .
forgotten about it ? how could you ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i m sorry .
that s all right . thank you all the same .
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well i ll be glad to help you out . my parents always seem to be very careful about getting more casual in more than ten years .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
i have been playing football since high school . at present i m a member of a community football club .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well i believe it but i can t accept any believe that our financial promotion is as big as it is .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been playing computer games .
for a while ?
i went to a small town in <unk> .
when to leave ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
i 've looked everywhere for it . but i don t remember the first time . it was the first time .
my name is zhang ming .
i said bonjour !
this is my first i ve met with you about my new boss .
yes . and your passport please .
no . i only do that .
certainly . it s a good idea . but there s a lot of noise outside .
no . we go back to the nature of china .
it 's all about me . i 'm glad we 're getting started .
yeah .
no i do n't . i go on a winter holiday instead .
thank you .
what 's your favorite dish or dishes ?
how often do you go to university ?
thanks . that would be very nice of you .
i really don t know what she s going to wear .
good . that is why i usually recommend you taking the course with me .
i have spoken my mind and do some homework .
that s true . i m going to go and see how you can do things and visit . the great wall is a good one but i think it s too expensive .
i used to be an <unk> nearly two years ago . i was a bit disappointed .
i bought them on the ancient olympics too . it is really expensive .
oh your tongue ? that 's terrible .
what kind of work are you qualified for ?
she got a master degree and now she is going to have a doctor .
i understand . what would you do after you think ?
well let s get started . if you want to learn some spanish and you can t get a job that doesn t have .
do they have to go to school on saturdays ?
i am sorry to hear that . let me help you with your credit card . it 's our policy .
how much is it ? is three hundred dollars enough ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
you re right . we are having a hard time finding a home .
but you re in china .
i have no idea .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet .
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of my friends play cards on the internet .
well i like others very much but i do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
yes i love it . i think it 's a good thing for me .
it 's a reserved opera named the monkey creates havoc in heaven .
i do n't like the story . i always enjoy watching tv .
tell me what you eat .
it 's said that the cowherd and the spinster the lover stars in heaven can only meet on the seventh eve so this day has become the lover 's day .
but what ?
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i have .
oh that s terrible . you re probably going to take the course .
how much is the ticket ?
ok . i 'll get to go . what 's your plan ?
yes .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
well it 's just a lot of work . the government is working on it .
you really have a good point .
they are fashionable and shiny clothes .
i don t have the problem with my bank . there are several charity shops that we can give you a lot of money .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i 'm pretty tired .
oh i am sorry to hear that . i think you are n't a good accountant .
the teacher asked me to make a speech in english class and i was n't prepared . he punished me by making me stand in front of the whole class . it was so embarrassing .
me too .
i 'm sorry . i 'm already doing something .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
do you think we will go in the church ?
me too .
yeah . i just want to watch football games and mountain climbing .
you re right .
i do n't like it very much . it s very nice .
i know . i 'm going to the winter .
at nine thirty .
i like spring too .
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
well let me see . well in the morning we still have some points to put on some points .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
why is that ?
i 'm not sure yet . it 's a good thing i 've been looking for .
oh yes . it is
anything else ?
yes i think so .
yes i am .
really ?
what s wrong with it ?
i am glad you like it .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
that 's all right .
may i ask you to take a credit card ?
but there is a big car park nearby .
why is it ?
but you mustn t leave it too long . did you report it the police ?
i will .
what would you like to call ?
thank you very much .
i hope you like it .
the same to you !
are you doing anything special ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
fine . we will be expecting you .
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to meet you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i can t decide right now .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
it s about the new situation .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
that 's too bad .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
i 'm sorry . what s the matter ?
it certainly is .
what 's the national anthem ?
very good . she 's almost married .
you 're right . but he 's going to have to start looking at her now .
what does she look like ?
she 'd be happy to be .
i 'm afraid it 's still a mistake . the nights are lower than the ground .
because you do n't want to smell bad .
can you print out his email address ?
yeah . it 's a good thing . you know it 's hard to keep a distance between him and his parents .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no . but i may have told you a couple of months .
i shall have done it this afternoon .
i 'm sorry i 'm late . i 'm going to meet some friends tomorrow .
you re kidding .
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
who 's that ?
what about some mascara ?
you know what i mean . i don t think she s got a nasty bruise on her face .
yeah . i saw her down the street .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i 'm going to try to call you later .
you 're probably going to love her .
no way ! it s true that she has a high nose .
yes . how are you doing ?
hi david . you 're so considerate . i saw you say .
nothing really .
well that 's life .
i do n't know . i hope it 's nothing serious .
well i do n't think so . it looks a bit like you were in the air .
that s right . then you just wear the shirt and tie .
how come ?
she did n't say anything about this .
those are money bags and they represent your financial situation .
sounds great .
thank you .
i will .
you need to blow off some steam . the world is not on your shoulder .
i am sorry . we can t really get out of the station .
yes . he 's in bed today .
he 's going to be married in june .
i 'll be there .
oh she is doing well .
what did you say ?
you mean the boy you met in love ?
he is a perfect guy .
yes .
who s the bridegroom ?
they 're going to get a new place in the suburbs .
yeah . i just got back from work .
why ?
i m glad to hear that .
i have been playing football since high school . at present i m a member of a community football club .
he s a bit conservative . he s a wife .
yes . good for you .
ok . well it 's a classic in style .
it sounds great . i 'd love to .
i am not . i just want to have a look at the tv .
they are subject to hard training . and besides you know how to use a computer .
what else should i do ?
what about this is not a time in a short time ?
you know what ? he s very funny and never give up his eyes .
that 's true . i guess the woman is going to agree with them .
you 're not really a <unk> .
thank you again for saying so . we have been in touch with you .
right . so what are you planning to join us ?
what good luck !
i have some tablets for seasickness .
do you think that we will try to get together ?
no .
good . this is your first year of all .
maybe it 's just a girl to do it .
well i think you re looking for a job . but you should be in the right direction .
i m not sure how you know that . i just want to know if you re a real person .
no problem .
ok . bye .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .
ok got it . i ll call you sometime next week .
fine .
it 's time to go . bye ella . hope to see you soon
bye jason .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
let me take a look . it 's a pity . let 's go to the doctor .
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
it 's hard to say . what 's your new life ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
ok . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
may i ask why you 're trying to get a visa ?
what do you mean ?
sure i will .
no .
are there any other computer games ?
i see . well why do n't we watch a lot of television ?
you are a quick learner . i do n't think you 'll have any trouble with this .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
what do you feel like having ?
i need help turning them on .
i guess it 's not a bad idea .
yes i do . i like the foxtrot and the music .
how about the words of the song ?
it 's hard to say ! but i love music very much .
no . but it is lucky for us . the market is very bad .
what 's your parents think of your dating a boy ?
oh peter . you really should go and play ball yourself rather than watching games .
no he has two daughters as well . his wife and daughters are visiting her parents . so i wo n't see them .
what 's wrong ?
your boss is really <unk> him .
good idea .
how ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
thank you . here 's your change .
is there something wrong with it ?
i wish it was n't but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it must be the most beautiful woman in the world .
i ll call the police now .
what s the score ?
what s the score ?
i got the message . i 'm quiting .
good idea .
you are joking .
i sure would .
he makes me sick .
he makes me sick .
it 's too bad . but if he brought my license too much it would probably be too late .
i feel like you are a good employer .
if you do n't mind me asking how long it will take to make .
exactly . instead i do n't like the story .
of course not . i think there are some good friends .
that 's good . are you planning on immigrating to another country ?
what do you use your quite often ?
what kind of soup would you like ?
you are right . but i think she 's better than a career woman .
i agree with you .
you 're right . it 's completely different .
good idea .
thank you very much .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but it 's terrible .
about what ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no i do n't usually take a look at my cell phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
what s the matter ? you are the best things i can do .
i am going to the mountains ! i m being alone in the morning !
my first grandchild .
look at the crystal clear fridge . you can see so many kinds of pets !
well thanks for your help !
thanks for reminding me . i m being a real man .
ok thank you .
yeah but it s a good question . . . well it s really hard to make our sense .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
well i m not sure but it s just that you ve been through a great guy ! you see i know that s just a more nice guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! i am not going to work till this ! i know i can get it out of control .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
do you like this place ?
ok .
that s great . do you have any other questions ?
honey seriously it s just a sheep . relax ! relax that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable .
what a beautiful home !
yeah i m sorry . . . .
i m sorry to hear that .
it 's nice . but we have always dreamed of owning our own home .
that was a great shot ! a three pointer yeah !
thank you for your reminding .
do you think that s a good idea ?
oh come on ! i ve been through this already ! i ve got a flat tyre .
i am not a thief vicki . and i guess it 's just a waste of time .
it s really a good game .
yeah definitely . but i ve got to go .
hey i m not a thief .
really ? i m sorry . i don t understand .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
i prefer a little sugar please .
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i m not sure . i m sure i m looking forward to seeing the game !
no it s not your fault . . . you know it s a small world .
i do n't know . i guess i ll be glad to do that .
look ! what are you doing ? you have a lot of stress ?
that s great ! i d love to go to the secret life .
wow you ve really went through a hard time .
come on . tell me about it .
dad ! i m gonna catch a cold .
no the other one . . . yes .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes please .
where do you get it from ?
wow !
interesting . . . . what s your favorite sport ?
to my office we have to go along with some other companies .
i 'm very sorry sir . i 'll ask you a question .
oh i m crazy about them .
i love your dish !
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
it 's hard for you to believe that you will find a suitable job . when you work you can accumulate a lot of experience . besides you need to take a lot of things out .
no problem .
this may be a little rude .
no i do n't think so .
it began with a <unk> then he fell for a few years .
oh i thought you were good at your house .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you you you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
have you heard about our special promotion this month ? if you purchase at least 200 yuan in any <unk> products you will receive this black hand bag with a sample of <unk> mascara and two shades of eye shadow .
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
i do n't like that . i do n't like it either . i 'm going to be late .
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
i 'm afraid not . we are very busy at the moment .
how did the business trip go ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
are there any other things i can do ?
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i have a big date tonight .
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
good gracious ! i am so sorry that i 've got to go .
she 's my new teacher .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had enough of art galleries cathedrals statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
i helped build the sets and find props for the plays . what about you ?
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
just a minute . i 'll make sure to get it for you .
yes . i ve been a few people in america .
what about your appetite ?
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
i 'm glad to hear that .
yeah it no one else has made it .
it 's unfair .
definitely .
what do you mean ?
i wish it was n't but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .
yes . it 's not only a surprise her but her father did not give him too much trouble .
it 's not a good idea . anyway we have to make our own decisions for him .
do people get along well with each other ?
you do ?
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
look at this mountain bike . it is only 330 . do you like it ?
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
true . but chinese is more stressful than most of the chinese .
but the word is his wife .
i have to work this tuesday .
what is your problem ?
that 's a good point . when you give a raise you should have a try .
well the chinese think do n't you ? i 've seen many women in japan . and i also think it 's difficult to learn english though .
so no . 4 is your favorite . which one do you prefer ?
really ? but i like red smell .
i want a different hair style .
i would like to book a room .
she 's my sister .
yes i think you are right ! he is the kind of guy who has the right to say that ! and the other guy in the company they always seem to be very serious !
do people usually get married ?
i know but i am not a child . i just want to go to a cafe and have a family who have a family who have a lot of fun .
he said he had to get rid of it .
yes . here it is .
we have a question .
don t worry about that . it s probably of the stress you ve been under . just take some aspirin . combined with the stronger cough medicine it will make you feel very tired . you shouldn t work or use any equipment which requires concentration . if i were you i d just sleep read a book or watch tv . here is your prescription .
ouch that hurts did you have anything from the room ?
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
oh i 'm sorry i know it but i ca n't accept it . it 's been a long time since you got here .
i had to look at the newspaper .
i agree . we just do n't understand the meaning of human beings .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
she is n't going to be late . she is n't there any other day .
but parents like the kids .
do you have a registration card ?
we have to make it well . we have n't been getting along well . the only problem is that i care about .
yes we are having a good time . we are always willing to do business with you .
the main reason i have a hamburger heaven . i heard that maybe you will like to make a good dining set .
but i am not sure if it does n't snow tomorrow .
sure . there is a folk concert tonight . do you want to go with us ?
it might be an expensive present but i 'm not sure .
will the employers see the information of the company ?
i will . you know i 'm a real fan of wanton marsalis .
it 's the automatic teller machine .
d like to try my own dessert .
it 's an excellent idea . you know i 'm an excellent leader .
i 'll be sure to . you 're right .
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yes but i heard that the weather is so changeable in the summer . do you think we can get any rain in the morning ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
not really . the air is small . it has a lot of trees in my country . the southeast of the country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
don t you think it s a cold for some people ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
certainly .
i think something must be done .
certainly .
i do n't think it 's a good system for a young lady . what do you think ?
i want a different hair style .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
but i still like them .
but i would n't be surprised if it started raining .
i want to order a large birthday cake several kinds of cold dishes pastries and fruits .
not always . but they like good meal .
no they 're not . but i think that chinese is good for you .
yes i like it . but i don t like it either . it s not a good idea to get used to the old people from different countries .
the price of the month is on the second floor . do you think it ll rain ?
i am going to the hospital to see susan .
do you mind if i sit down ?
congratulations .
i especially liked the night air .
of course .
i am sorry sir . your room is full now . you can wait in the departure area after that .
i 'm not sure .
why do n't you try it and see what happens ?
i am going to travel around europe .
really ?
sure . our public schools are not very strict at all . we like to learn more about our english .
i 'd be happy to write it down for you .
yes that 's true .
well we have a lot of applicants for a couple of days . you can have a look at your new job .
do you have any homework today ?
yes i 'm going to the untied states for travel . what places do you recommend ?
ok let 's play it .
do you have any hobbies besides playing chess ?
well it 's easy . most of the time you buy from a guest to pay a fitness level but all in order to to get a lot of things done in a while .
now yours are playing .
yes i like collecting antiques .
i m so happy for you .
really ? what was the score ?
it 's the best season for the world in the world .
it 's a tradition . but if you ask me the white rice ball you will surely understand .
do n't worry about your stress . you do n't have to take exercises too much .
i was pretty tired . i had to get an early start in the morning and then i stayed in bed for two days .
but there is a big bonus for employees at the end of the week .
three suitcases and a handbag .
i d like to see the doctor .
i 'm a little more yellow i 'll take you one .
it sounds like a good idea .
well i 'm telling you now .
i beg your pardon ?
what did he do ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
what 's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
i think it 's a good idea . let 's go !
i know . i have to do it every day .
just pick something and get it for the bottom of the list . i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . . .
ok i 'm just glad there are nothing wrong with my taxi .
you said it . but you two weeks are on vacation this evening .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . . . .
not at all . we have a couple of different styles .
it does n't matter .
in china that s been completely honest .
no they 're not . if you ask me i can explain something about it .
that 's a good idea to get a job .
i am sorry to say it 's a way to save all the stuff . you need to take care of this .
oh you know please . . .
please give me one more chance .
oh do you have a copy of the tour ?
if you say we will win the bet .
sounds fantastic !
oh you know please .
ok . i think they can just drive slowly and we can make it the safety .
sure . why are you <unk> ?
i love this kind of style .
oh you know what ? i 've been going to the club regularly . the training really pays off . now i am in a good shape and i know more about how to keep fit .
no . why ?
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
no way !
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
if my car is coming down right now it 'll probably be a good idea .
she 's so cute .
he 's got a promotion .
impossible . my pager is really old . it does n't display messages .
maybe . but i m not sure !
ok i am going to try that out in a few months .
fine . we ll be expecting you .
oh that s not a bad idea . i don t know how to play the guitar .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work .
look next time get yourself some comfy shoes . you re gonna come back again with me aren t you ?
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
can i mail this letter now ?
do n't worry . you will be responsible for our customers .
i was just there a couple of days ago . you know you should go down there too . they have a lot of stylish clothes on sale .
have you just started getting a lot of headaches ?
yes i m . i ve been out of town . i just got back .
yeah . but you re crazy about him .
yeah he once gave me the money .
i 'm still not sure . i think i 'm going to quit my job .
really ? well you ll be happy .
yes .
that must be a sad story . he was always taking you to the wedding with a famous man .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
next june .
i m still not sure about my situation . you know i ve been in the sale department and our boss s seem to have a lot to do . i ve just been thinking about hiring those too .
come on . you are being a father of the olympics .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well . we started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done .
it s a pity that i cannot afford it .
until monday or tuesday next week .
that 's great . thanks .
i m not going to be so sure i ll be thirsty .
yes . we have always dreamed of traveling around and go out for a walk .
the palace hotel .
i m sure your friend will get a promotion right now .
it s just a few minutes to find out that we are going to have to let you go .
i know you 're right .
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
about seven years now . and you ?
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
ha i ll keep that in mind but don t tell my husband .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall and tall .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no i haven t . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .
cindy s husband is ron .

they have two childrenone son and one daughteras well as one daughterinlaw and one soninlaw .

he 's fine . he retired last week . it 's turning going in his life . now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .
how old is he ?

do you have a receipt ?
my favorite is diablo . it used to be star craft but it is getting a little old .

did you see the doctor ?
well come and talk to me then .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .

will that be the sixth of september ?
i hope that i can finally get started .
oh i m sorry . i m still working for the company .

i can help you . what 's it like ?
well i 'm not sure . maybe it means we can buy something through the internet .
i see . i 'll do that then .
well it 's a national campaign .
ok . that 's a good choice . do you have any cheaper ones ?
i 've been looking for a small amount for years . i believe it is quite a substantial deal .
it 's rather more than i was thinking of paying .
right . we 'll see you this way .
i 'm sure i can help you .
i know i know but it is always easier to get the price done in a few months .
well i think i 'll take it . it 's not a pretty cheap neighborhood .

it 's pretty cheap . well i think i 'll take it .
sure .
could you make it a little lower ?
not really . i 'd like to learn about the things .
how much do we owe you ?
it depends on the weight of your package .
it seems that you have a good time . we 'll have it brought you around .
all right . we can make it another one and consider your decision . as you know the price is a deal .
i understand .
this kind of atmosphere ?
it seems that i 'm the only one for the market .

how about your mother ?
some of the students in my office are a frequent guest here .
what 's the difference between the two parties ?
in a position you must know how to use the telex and the photocopier and the word processor . by the way do you get a job on your desk ?
have you ever heard about our company ?
yes i would . i am sure i can .
i suppose you re right . but i still do n't think that s true .
sure but you must have to pay the fee .
yes . is that so important ?
why ? what time is it ?
about seven years now . and you ?
how many people are there in your family ?

good answer miss zhanggood answer ! seriously though are you interested in staying in a stafflevel position or would you hope to move into management someday ?

i m smith the manager of human resources department . may i ask your name ?
yes i passed college english test band 6 with good skill in listening speaking reading and writing . i have n't got any certificate of computer skills because i don t think certificates are necessary if what s needed is merely operating a computer . i think practically to know how to use a computer is more important . and i am quite familiar with microsoft office .
yes i nearly did n't sleep last night .
really ? how come ?
you know miao limy roommate he bought a computer last month . he has turned his computer into an electronic playground . he plays football rides horses drives racing cars and does a whole bunch of other games . every night he keeps me up .

well i ll try to keep it if you like .
what do you mean ?
i want a different hair style .
i am studying languages .

what courses have you completed ?
i like no . 4 .

i said i have no idea .
i got a bachelor 's degree .
so it has a history for more than a decade ?
i 'll first get along with my colleagues and get along with all the colleagues .
what do the side of the newspaper do i get ?
i will begin to learn english in the future .
it 's too small for me . do you have any smaller ones ?
nice to meet you ! my name is peter smith .
thank you ! it s nothing serious .
nice to meet you too .
it 's ! it 's been a ten to eight o 'clock .
ok i will . bye !
you 're welcome .
he can move .
i know . but our company is fully committed at the moment and hundreds of clients are very good .
that 's right .
i want my change .
may i ask you what kind of salary you have in mind ?
i m renting this apartment out for 1050 a month .
your decision is to start with a base salary of 20000 yuan with a partner and i 'll give you a bonus of month .
we will try to arrange it .
it is but i 'm afraid it will be too expensive .
i like that .
i 'm happy to hear that but i have a lot of work .
no . i don t have any other questions . i can get it .
you should work nine hours a day for three days .
that 's all right . i do n't mind working hard .
they are both chinese and spanish .
i suppose they are quite different .
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
yes i can . i speak it very well .
what do you think of the literature course ?
yes a little .
you said it .
why do you plan to change your job ?
yes i do . who are your financial backers ? who are the key competitors ? does the company have a plan for the ipo ? what would you say is the best thing about your product or service ?
certainly .
they take care of a lot of things .
you can test your student identification card to make some recommendation .
are they covered by worker ?
well i have a guest pass . why do n't you come with me tonight ?
is there any way to make an appointment ?
quite a lot . they take care of everyone and get along with each other .
yes i do . on a scale of one to 10 what would you say morale was in this company ?
what will you do this right ?
how often do you have lunch ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i 'm studying in the foreign languages department .
i suppose you 're right .
i had a really good experience with computer skills .
yes i know that . but i get accepted from jobs in the future .
what do you think of your english ?
i studied french at school but i ve forgotten most of it . i learnt some russian while i was studying there and now i study spanish and i always loved studying there .
i think i am . i have been in the quit of my present job as a clerk in a store .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
it sounds interesting .

that 's great . will the utilities be turned on ?
take me to the station please .
have you ever been to las vegas ?
me too . i like to go to the movies and watch tv .
i 'd like to go to the summer palace .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
let 's call it a deal .
i want justice .
i think that 's a good idea .
i will try to use it as soon as possible .
i 've got it . and can you tell me what the date is today ?
i have working knowledge of windows and dos . actually i 'm quite familiar with both java and c programming languages .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
any other certificates ?
i found it a garage sale once .
maybe you should ask the interviewer about yourself .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
what am i going to do ?
i don t like the way that i get my skin from the doctor .
all right .
you can nod or ask questions at the right time to show that you have already understood or you are quite interested in his words .
only in the long run you should try to make a statement .
how dangerous ! i 've almost knocked him down .
well i am applying for the position of computer engineer .
can you imagine that i 'm not a good swimmer ?
oh i see .
from what is the lowest rate for a person ?
yeah that 's right .
sure . what i mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it 's in writing .

that s very important . i can t make it any time .
very good . let 's get a table to discuss the <unk> before the meeting .

sure like taste variety nutritional value what i should do is move into an apartment off campus where i can cook for myself .
what should i learn from ?

that 's good . how often do you write to them ?

i know i have the abilities qualities and a nurse who worked for the university of director in her company .
thank you .

thank you . we 'll be meeting the day after tomorrow .
i really do n't know how to thank you for meeting me at the airport .

you too .
i will try my best .
oh thanks . i ll see you tomorrow .
it 's a very popular place .
thanks i ll .
i 'm afraid we ca n't .
certainly . it 's the most important thing to me . first of all you need to do this . if you just need to wait a moment . . .
it 's a pleasure . here you are .
yes it is quite reasonable .
no not yet . is there anything else ?
but the contract says we ca n't accept any mistakes .
it is a little impolite in such a shade . . . .
what is it ?
yes it is quite reasonable .
you 're welcome .
what is it ?
i 'm glad you 've come to see me .
of course . first you have to turn this switch on .

do you like this job ?
i left after the opening dance . i could n't wait to get out of there .
i have a lot of previous customers but i 'm sorry to tell you that i will do some research about that .
i 'm going to need some more information about these accounts .
we will begin next monday . would you be available then ?
first as far as i know your company has had an impressive growth record . second i want to get into the foreign trade business .
what do you mean by us ?
there s always a very busy project coming up . i ve learned some skills for the personnel department such as vacuums from several years . i am very <unk> about journalism and this job .
yes i do . who are your financial backers ? who are the key competitors ? does the company have a plan for the ipo ? what would you say is the best thing about your product or service ?
yes .
no problem . i am looking forward to it .
generally it is 6 months and during the period you are halfpaid .
i 'm not sure about that .

i 'm glad to hear that .
generally speaking training new members is usually necessary .
so where was the wedding ?
we have a good time . it 's not always a priority . we can not be well prepared .
i m afraid we have to . but if we take more than 100 it would be too late .
you can take them away from me .
how old is she ?
i have been at home for more than ten years . while it 's difficult to work i still have a job .
i see . why do you think you re qualified for this position ?

it s a monthly salary which has been determined according to the first year of the company .
500 dollars .
very good . which one would you like to work in ?
it 's the most important thing to me .
yes you have a total of 21 days paid vacation and a year of paid vacation every year .
i hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . since my major was international banking i really hope to work at a bank .
then why do you want to work for our bank since it 's a new establishment in shanghai ?
because your bank is a new one i think i 'll be given more opportunities and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here .
it certainly is . but the work is also hard here . you need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field .
i expect to work hard madam .
do you mind going on frequent business trips ?
i think we should go to a physical idea .
we could meet again sometime this afternoon .
yes i 've been looking forward to it .

i got to know your company through such famous brands as lux lipton and walls . after making a customer survey i was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of chinese .
why would you like to work with us ?
it 's an interesting job and your company is one of the best known . although i have no work experience as a salesperson the job description you sent was very interesting . it 's a job i 've been dreaming of when i was at university .

that s fine . thanks for coming to see us . i hope to be able to let you know about the job within the week .

it 's really a big mistake .
i have a lot of mood in the office and a lot of chores in the house .

i 'd like to . but i 'm not sure if it is a good idea .
we just play basketball earlier and tennis .
to be honest i think he 's lazy . you should go to a concert instead .
well i 'm not so sure .
i 'm so happy for you .
how was your flight ?
that s great . could you please bring me some wine ?
i 'm afraid you 're right . what do you think we should do as a team ?

i like doing aerobics in my spare time . it 's good for my health .
i 've set some goals for myself and my career and unfortunately i 'm at a standstill in my current situation . i have begun to explore options available before i spend too much time in a job where i ca n't advance . my goal is to continue to take on new responsibilities and be a key contributor to the success of an online venture .
what is it ?
i m very clear about it .
why do you think you re the right candidate for this position ?
yes i am .
nice to meet you mr . li .
a very good place .
but there 's no rush .
twentyone .

oh that sounds terrible . would you be happier with higher pay here ?
i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
yes of course . i 'd like to .
how much ?
good . i am looking forward to working with you .
that 's the warehouse .
well we 're going to have to cancel your reservation . please let us know the other terms of the contract .
i want justice .
what 's the price of the item today ?
yes .
no i am not . i think i 've found a way to find a suitable job .
but we have no choice .
yes . i think they must be very pleased .
but your price is too high .
there are twenty of our products you can get what you pay for .
well i 'll consider the possibility . by the way when do you think it 's a possible to get into the market ?
we have our daily level of 3 to 5 . we can process the agreement now .

he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what do you mean ?
i want a different hair style .
well a secretary should take a few minutes to complete the information and get prepared .
i do n't think i understand what you mean .
the personnel market is to use the third floor . you should also take a break and see how to set the report .
yes and sometimes the connection isn t very good . i think it s much easier to find a job that is <unk> than done .
no really ?
yes .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
how do you usually make it ?
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
well rest assured that you have to work overtime and finish your work .
some people do n't really believe in that .
martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that she is also a good fit . it s also a good company to describe her goals but she is also very worried about the job .
yeah that s not a bad idea . we can t make it . we ve got the same time .
well i suppose you have to provide some additional credits for a employee who takes the additional course for his or her goals management .
would you have a definite idea ?
wow ! all this sounds perfect .
i 'm sorry to hear that . but i have to go over the phone with you on such a big reduction . the invitation says no one who has to be as serious as possible .
let 's see
why do you say that ?
not yet . the company will have to find out if they are hired .
wow ! this sounds like a lot of fun ! why do n't you take a picture of me on a please ?
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .

well he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
i 'm easy to approach and friendly to everyone .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
i am quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend in <unk> . the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
i graduated from peking university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes . i got the title of advance worker in 2006 .
do you have any publications ?
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy and it was published in china daily .
i can speak french and german .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
no i can only carry on a simple conversation in french .
can you read and write english well ?
i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed <unk> .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
it was quite special actually . i had to eat a lot of videos from home .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .
yes . i would like to go to new york for my christmas vacation .
i 'm mary kelly . may i ask your name ?
my name is b . how are you miss kelly ?
i 'm glad to meet you mr . zhuang . sit down please .
thank you miss kelly .
what are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ?
i can type 120 words a minute and i take shorthand at 80 words a minute .
would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?
yes i would .
how much ?
yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let s go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism and this seemed like a g
certainly . and this course has very interesting news . i 'm afraid i 'm not yet .
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
what s your experience ?
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .

thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .

yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m 27 and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around 16 .
ah i see so you were actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business

what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .

should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
yes it s right .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
well all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents information and other things .
what are they ?
one study said that lowincome groups have a higher percentage of overweight people than higher income families .
and what is the most important point ?
you should always remember that one customer one file is the rule .

no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
what do you suggest i should see in new york ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?

so as long as i have one of those ?
no . this is the receipt .

oh no . well there 's just one thing . we 've got the wrong . we have n't had such a long time .
let 's see . . . there seems to be a lot of qualified people here in the very beginning of the year . they are likely to be married this season .
i see . i think it 's not a problem . i 'll have to think about it .
no i have n't got your name .
250 yuan . but i 'm not sure . it 's a good idea to get the same goods as the new ones .
sounds reasonable .
i 'd like to see if you 've got any problem .
oh thank you . i m looking for the help .
you know what you mean by a bank inquiry to the bank . the money and the money will be transferred automatically into the stock market .

is there any minimum for the first deposit ?
oh wonderful ! i m looking for a nice gift .
i understand and what you do n't have done .

i wonder if you could have a look at it .
how many guests do you offer ?
what can i do for you now ?
of course . what 's the problem ?
i would like to deposit 300 .
for the bank manager ?

i 'm afraid not . we will accept any tips .

i would like to talk to you about your daughter .
ok . then i 'll take it .
no kidding .
ok . here you are .
right . . . .
here it is .
i need help turning them on .
it 's hard to say . the goods are all working on this .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
sounds quite reasonable . thanks very much .
to be frank as you know we are in the heart of other countries in asia .
the goods are wellexamined before shipment . i 'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route .
ok i will take your advice .
i see .
i 'm a <unk> .
but do you have any <unk> in most of the outdated issues ?
thank you .
what about supply of the order ?
certainly .
i know . but we ca n't accept your words .
this color is nice .
one study said that lowincome groups have a higher percentage of overweight people than higher income families .
oh yes .
no thanks .
sounds nice . can you read the characters ?
it 's a deal .
i 've been looking forward to visiting your factory .
oh i almost forgot . there is one thing i do n't like the dangerous job .
yes it is very nice of you .
you 're welcome .
it 's our pleasure . we are here to show the business you are . we are expecting you to come in and have a good day .
as you know i have a product that is ok . i just don t know how to deal with it .
ok . let 's get a bottom bunk . what about the 3rd part ?
all right . but do you have any questions ?
but what about your price ?
i 'm quite sure . i 'm <unk> by the name of the guide .
what do you do for a living ?
i am afraid we have no idea of ordering the price . you know our prices are higher than the quotations we ve received from other countries .
you need to be very careful with it .
ok . i 'm afraid my arm is broken .
at nine thirty .
we will need a few minutes at the latest . if you can get the goods i must say something about the latest .
i 'm afraid it is our practice so we ca n't make it any further reduction . we 'll accept it .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
wow a lot of money ! how about the training ?
we have the same opinion .
yes but we have a few to discuss with our clients .
i see . but our general manager is in charge of the agreement .
it 's very sensible .
i see . they were looking forward to your call .
could you please call me again if i need some more help ?
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
what time is your vacation ?
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
that 's too bad . did they handle all the work ?
what 's that ?
it is our 10th wedding anniversary this june 20 .
i hope you can set the table by the end of the month .
now is there any warranty with this ?
i thought you had an elephant in your house .
what time is your appointment ?
we do n't do that .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
sure .
i 'm afraid we ca n't do that . let 's put the contract ready by contract .
do you want me to pick you up at the zoo ?
all right . thank you .
good . we can also consult some from the factory and see if they have received the goods .
i see . can you weigh these red ones for me please ?
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
yes it can make it .
yes of course . we are creating a 50 discount from your target price .
unfortunately we 're busy at the moment .
well . we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l c payable against shipping documents .
i fully understand your position . an irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time . but on the other hand it would add to the buying costs . we 've been after all trading partners for 3 years and you know us well . ca n't you give us d a or d p ?
no problem . we 'll accept the delay .
according to the usual minimum amount each month . you can pay in cash of 300 per month .
well mrs . wang you must be aware that the general manager is in his opinion . we ca n't go to any responsibility in this . we wish to say that the letter of credit relationship with us .
here we are .

thank you .

of course please write them down on this receipt .
what happened to them ?

thank you .
would you like a savings or a chequing account ?
a thousand dollars .
three thousand ! that 's almost too good to be true . did she say why her friend wants to sell it ?
yes i 've got a meeting with my boss . it 's time to move on to work .
it 's 1 australian dollar to 6 . 1 yuan rib for each kilometer and the internal interest rate is 1 . 5 yuan .
which type of account do you want to open ?
here you are .
oh . current account don t pay our interest .
but i need the money .
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
i see . how do i draw money from my news then .

right . here it is .
i 'd like to have some local specialties . would you recommend for me please ?
four in hundred one hundred and ten in ten please .

thank you .

they 're a little bit expensive but they 're a bit expensive .

they are two thousand island and the rest of the world is guess .
ok here you are .
thank you .
why is it to look at the advertisement ?

well i 'm looking for some summer clothes .
do you know what kind of currency you want ?
i do n't need a deposit here .
what s your account number ?
here you are .
it 's rib for the service . but we are only paying in cash .
all right !
we have a deal with it . i 'll help you fill in this form and show me your id .
i think i 'll go to the bank to check .
does that include utilities ?
ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest of small changes please .
right . and what is the problem ?
thank you .
thanks and you too .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind .
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
i ve been out of here for a year . how about you ?
but do n't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?
i 'm the guy .
how many people are there in your party ?
in order to 100 usd this letter please .
do i get a card ?
i m not going to be able to afford any cash in the mall .
ok ! i 'll take that .
yeah i did n't sleep a wink last night .
i 'm proud of you for standing by little arts but i really do n't think you 'll be able to get any award of this worth .
what 's that ?
it 's a total ripoff of an american reality show but the imitation is unbearably clumsy .
there are so many people here . where are you going ?
i was denied a visa ?
is there anything else ?
is that all ?
well i m sorry sir . we chose a good set of agreement ! the client s market right now we have a good reputation for the company .
sure what do you need to do there ?
i need to talk to you about that new driver you ve hired . i think i am going to have some problems working with him .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you retire you retire you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
that s right . here are .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yes . i want to book a room .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
you see the results are very hard to find a general increase in the price of the contract . that is our credit limit .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i m sending the card and print it out .
please input your 6 digit pin code followed by the pound key . thank you . please select an option . thank you have selected withdrawal .
yeah yeah yeah i know what i selected . just gimme my money !
do n't you think it 's a good way to pay all of your money ?
no ! stupid machine what are you doing ! no !
confirmed . thank you for using our bank ! please remove your card from the slot . goodbye !
one hundred and fifty yuan .
how much would you suggest ?
i think the price is reasonable .
it 's a little higher . but i 'll consider it to be a little low .
can you deliver the waitress with our check please ?
how about coming with me ? i can show you to the price at around fifty .
yeah that s a good idea . you look a little too wild .
let 's put it down . we 're hoping to give you a discount of 20 percent .
