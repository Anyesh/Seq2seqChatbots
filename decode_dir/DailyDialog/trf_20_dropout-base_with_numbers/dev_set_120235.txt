that 's true . but americans like all the time of us .
please get a ticket free to london from the entrance of the hotel . he 'll take a taxi to get there .
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
i 've got plenty of time .
please .
you wo n't get up on time . i 'm not going to miss the plane .
hi .
you can t come in yet at least two thirty .
how about some fish ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok i 'll take a look . can i have it right now ?
the problem is that i can afford to buy a new apartment .
right .
no i 'm afraid not . it 's <unk> . just take your room key .
what s the problem ?
i 'm afraid there is n't .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks . can you deliver ?
probably not . doing that will probably take another three hours which i ca n't afford now .
how many nights a week is it ?
it 's only 20 .
why do n't you send it by mail payment order ?
no problem . however if you have to meet at least ten percent discount we can offer you ten percent .
i 've got plenty of time .
please .
what 's your job ?
is it far ?
i think a cab is better .
oh excellent . how much does it cost ?
you 're welcome .
sorry . i 'm afraid that i can t . they were in fashion now .
i like miniskirt .
well . cantonese food is rather light beijing food is heavy and sichuan food is usually hot and spicy .
i like it a lot . can you try it on ?
i want one that is easy to handle . can you show me the latest ones ?
no problem .
it looks nice . how much is it ?
yes . it is very helpful .

you 're right . i 'll take you one .

it 's the same size and the color .

it 's nice . i like it very much .
i see . do you want me to show you some ?
i think you 're right . i 'm just not sure .
yes . come with me .
have you tried the outlet ?
of course . the fitting room is this way please .
how did the business trip go ?
got it . someone says he can help with the shipping company .
we need a lot of things .
what s the most important thing for them ?
i was wondering if the manager could come back in two days .
i understand . but why do you think i can figure out the way ?
you are right . another time was to wait .
thank you for telling me . too much !
excuse me ?
just send the application through jobwanted on the website .
i would like to cancel one of my accounts .
yes . what size do you wear ?
the bigger one is ok .
you just missed it .

yes i have i tried once when i visited your country last year i think they were very tasty . can you cook them ?
i certainly can . if i can get some from the butchers i ll cook them for you .
that sounds great . i 'll bring a bottle of wine .

what about the jeans ?
what 's the difference ?
i believe it s going to ms . wilson .

sounds painful . i think i can take a look at it .
hmm . that s a good idea . i think it s better for my credit card .
yes .
are you ready to transfer tomorrow ?
i 'm serious have you ?
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
oh you are a good child .
i 'll give you five more minutes then i 'm going on without you !
yes i bought it a few things .

do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
we need to get a new one for you .
your new car is so clean . i do n't want to move my own car until i can get home .
i think we should call the police immediately .
maybe i could just get a few minutes free drink too .
that is unnecessary .
you 'll find it in the opposite direction .
could you please tell me when we get there ?
thank you . where is your domicile ?
i do n't think so .
but i do n't know which one to choose .
what 's the brand ?
here you go .
you 're welcome .
let 's get a cab . it 'll be alright .
you get off on del mar and hill .
yes . i 'd like a cup of onion soup .
will you need anything to drink ?
what kind of desserts do you have ?
i 'll have a special promotion too . and i 'm asking for my wife .
what have you got ?
how about some coffee ?
yes let me have a medium pepsi .
mr . smith i did n't realize that he had a question .
yeah .
if you refuse to be a double shot of espresso .
yes we did .
you forgot ? you . . .
i see .
about twelve hours . i have to go to work straight to the far east and get to the airport .
would you like to go to the dentist ?
ok . that 'll be a new one .
i appreciate your understanding .
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
okay . i need to have a rest .
i 'm not sure .
i promise i 'll do my best .
of course . but it 's quite far from here .
i must have left it in the mail .
it 's a tenminute walk .
how far is it ?
you 're welcome .
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
that d be great but could i have a cup of tea first ?
sure i ll just go put the kettle on . why don t you have a seat on the sofa and i ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .
i see . well i can help with the chores while i m here . you two could probably use my help .
that s very nice of you to offer . here s your tea . be careful it s still quite hot .
it 's just around the corner . turn left at the second traffic light and then go straight for two blocks .
do you know the name of the street ?
you know . it 's one of the best ones .
how long ago ?
no . it 's only a tenminute walk .
thank you very much .
you 're welcome .
sorry but i m not really interested in those things .
well they are very nice you know .
really ?
yes .
oh i do n't care about that .
everybody is buying them .
are they ?
yes they re very fashionable you see .
i am afraid i am not interested in fashion .
yes . there are about a few blocks away from here .
ok i 'll wait for you .
walk down till you see the first lights . it 's cross the street .
it 's on the right hand side of the library .
oh well . i 'll have to live with it . what else can i do ?
yes it is .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that 'll be too expensive . we only have one day left for that .
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing .
that s even better than the real thing .
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than 100 you get a 50 voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
sure . the fitting room is right over there .
yes . i am a bit confused . my sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called sociology and the modern age . according to the syllabus the book is in the library but i have n't been able to find it .
this is kevin .
yes . i have to stay at home and watch a movie .
you 'd better get another pair for work .
would you like to go now or later ?
she 's so pretty famous about her .
oh i see . hey i 'll take her .
oh ! they get everything for the week .
i like the fabric but i don t like the style .
yes .

well you have fun .
i agree how much ?
you just said 10 rounds .

so how about an aperitif ?
it sounds good . i 'd like to start with a compare .
stirred or shaken ?
stirred will be fine .
here you are .
thank you .
sure . all of our mixed drinks are excellent . you can also try a delicious nonalcoholic cocktail .
can you recommend one ?
try a singer . it has lime juice and grenadine over ice .
it sounds interesting . i 'll take one .
here we go .
it tastes great .
enjoy yourself .
yeah .
i think so .
i agree . i 'll just have a try .
it 's a kind of rice ball that is made in malaysia . what about you ?
i think i 'll have a glass of juice .
how do you make it ?
sounds good ! what are you talking about ?
they are very compact sir .
i would like to have the coffee rum pies .
i 'm so hungry !
are you sure about anything ?
i 'd like to order a bottle of champagne lobster tail and filet mignon medium rare .
i never thought about that but you could take eating better .
oh ! you can take the picture or the original certificate and then we 'll send it to you .
blah . . . what 's that ?
no problem . i ll wait here for you .
what do you mean by that ?
you 're welcome .
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
well that 's true . you do n't like it ?
that does look good .
i 'm not sure yet . i just want to try something else .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ? how can i help you ?
um this steak i asked for to be medium rare .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
she was a famous actress when i was still a schoolgirl .
is she strict ?
what did you do ?
have you got your certificates on the same day ?
one moment . do you want to withdraw some cash while you 're at it ?

i don t like it . i m going to go shopping .

it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
you 're right . i promise .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .

about 50 .
that 's very kind of you . i do n't want to trouble you .
yeah . i know a good place to hire bikes if you do n't want to .
no i 'm afraid not .
that 's true . when can i start working ?
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
oh and how about other guests ?
he has a mustache if i remember correctly and a light complexion .
what about a party ?
would you like to have a look at the kitchen ?
i 'm glad to hear that . the board is jenny here .
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's about a tenminute walk .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
all right .

ok let me have it .
yes i think the government is to use some foreign currency . it s much more convenient than those before .
well . i mean all the terms of the contract is a little higher than we expected . we wo n't have to consider the contract by early if we consider the contract be held in a third month .
yes of course . we will get the goods ready by two percent .
it was n't too bad . at lease i 'm alive .
look at the dishes !
what a pity !
no i did n't . they had to be honest . i got a wrong number .
we should take a packed car instead of driving . the government will have to take a few days to get it quick .
i can t believe i was eating fine .
is that all ?
my boss just passed away last night .
what happened ?
yes ! it 's very kind of you to say . all my friends are !

hello i 'm just waiting for someone .
yes . and i 've been wanting to believe that for a change . i 'm just running into the tree .
no . the road is really necessary . but i believe it 's much easier to break down here .
i did n't think it was that interesting . what did you think ?
no . the only thing i 've come back is that i find a place to see people do n't have a small house . the way they do n't have anything to lose .
ok . i just thought you were in a cafe . you did n't tell me you were going to be able to get it up .
why ? i was n't .

are you having any luck ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few rummage sales on saturday . i think i ll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate 9 from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at kimble s department store .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at <unk> s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .

yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why how much did you pay for it ?

they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
no you can give me a brief overview . the see is that a little small percentage .
that 's right . the only thing that is n't ready is the hotel . it has been a pretty long time since it 's hard .
what do you do with it ?
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .

you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .

maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .

tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .

can you describe their taste ?

how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
we will tell you if you want to do something different .
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
can you eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
alright . you 'll find someone again .
it 's a little different . it 's a price tag for a person with a control .

i like your wife .
well . i 've got a lot of new apartment in this city .

ok . i 'll send it to you tomorrow morning .
where would you like to be located ?
i see . thank you for your advice .
sure thing .

where to ?
wangfujing please !
ok .
i have to be there before <unk> .

that 's fine .
ok . i 'll get it for you .
here 's twenty dollars .
well it 's 12 .
oh i see .
please fill out the form .
yes i do .
hello madam . where to ?
can you get me a beach umbrella and a deck chair ? i d like to go to the butcher 's side .
ok . thank you .
but you 'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight wo n't you ?
do n't worry about that . how many dollars have you been living here ?
here is ten yuan . keep the change .
it is at the north of forbidden city on the central axis of beijing .
will you be able to get a shopping cart ?
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
why are you applying to leave ?
thank you very much .
hi . it s tony calling from the dentist s office . is lily there ?
yeah this is a <unk> . what can i do for you ?
thank you . where should i send your final phone bill ?
yes i 'm .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
okay i 'll see you in the future .
see you then .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of charge .
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hi tom !
wow you sound like a <unk> .
i went up on my way to the doctor 's .
i 'm fine thanks .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
that 's great !
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
the same to you . but if you do n't mind i 'll always call you over and talk to your secretary and we can begin with you later .
thank you very much .
do n't you hit it off ?
i began to went there last month .
right .
she 's pretty easy to get along with . she listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .
what is your strongest trait ?
oh no . i mean it 's a new one .
he must have a lot of good ones to consider .
what happened ? are you going to see him ?
thank you .
i can take the time .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
no ! when you have to apply for your health !
what do i do ?
yeah ! i would think that you ve been looking forward to here for a long time !
what 's the cause of gas ?
ok ! i ve got a few ! when i was playing the piano class ! i ve never had a bad cold !
just shopping . i 'll just go and get some .
some people say that history is much better than usual .
there we are ! i m not going to put a crime into my car .
i m looking for a sweater .
are you looking for a small camera ?
what s the price ? i don t have any other leather one but i ll take a look at the latest .
what s your camera ?
actually i think the additional courses should be a highly competitive membership . after that i have a total of the insurance policy .
sure i 'll have a look .
thank you .
so you re not interested in <unk> ?
thanks a lot . my wife bought this outfit a few days ago .
i m sorry . there s no sell in my country . i think we should buy an inexpensive camera .
do you know where it is ?
i don t think that there s a possibility .
and how do you think it is ?
please say it again .
luckily this is an emergency room to have a problem .
that s right .
thanks for saying so !
no problem ! do n't mention it .
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
no thank you . that 's all i need now .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll speak to bob he 'll be able to help us .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes .
no way ! i m serious !
it s fine . could you put the name of the company ?
you are right . it has a lot of sense to tell the truth . it will take a long time to find a place in the dirty polled air . how am i going to get that ?
it seems that you will be working in this office .
it is a little more expensive sir . but it would be a little expensive .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
what size do you wear ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's no hot water after 10 at night . sometimes i like to have a hot shower before bed . especially in the winter . it feels good .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
the lawn looks really nice .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
i could get a few more especially if it s expensive .
i have n't thought of that .
yes it is really quiet .
and can i help you with anything else ?
the ad says 325 plus deposit .
that s way too much .
what account do you want to go to ?
what do you mean ?
let me see . a roasted duck is 25 . a plate of pork is 6 . 50 . a bowl of beef is 6 dollars . two bottles of beer are 4 . that 's a total of 42 . 50 dollars .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you please reconsider ?
i think a chinese student <unk> on written english and uses it as a basis for communicating . from start to finish he s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . this is a very difficult way to learn .
i am not certain about that .
yes . i like cooking very much . i got this hobby when i was 12 years sold .
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah . i like the way it takes me to decide if i 'm a vegetarian . i could never get any chinese food i want .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
are you sure he will like your suit ?
i 'll be glad to have a look .
the color i use now is natural beige . how much does it cost ?
you have the best price in the world .
you ll have to get a dozen of them at the same time .
well i just got here yesterday . it s the same practice today .
no ! they don t . i m afraid of making a new jacket .
i 'll have them bought for a half an hour and a half .
the tip is very nice .
the brown dress is all right .
they re awesome . that s their only one perfect .
oh i hope you do n't need to worry about it .
this is he . what can i do for you ?
i was wondering if there 's any opportunity to look for a job .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i am not sure .
i love it on the balcony .
that 's fine . i will see you then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
i 'm not sure where to find one .
you 're welcome .
ok .
no but if you need anything just call me .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
but the price has been reduced by 50 . it s a real bargain .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it is really quiet .
right that would be great .
i know .
with so few windows how can you even see what the problems are ?
okay . we have a few vacancies available right now .
it s great . i really wanted to see it .
the bathroom plumbing is too bad for me .
i do n't think the quality is too bright .
five . besides cats and two are small .
great ! then it is ! look at the dishes !
right here .
in the meantime you didn t find out if it is a large enough to send a larger car .
sure .
it 's the fourth time i go see the village and i can help you make a special place .
wow ! this place is so beautiful . i love the design and prison .
i thought it might rain .
thank you .
that s what i m looking for .
this is he . what can i do for you ?
hello i am calling to see if you are free . what can i do for you ?
oh where are you going to go ?
i can think of it .
let 's see .
i appreciate it very much .
please use the computers to be delivered as soon as possible . i can start working on it .
i see . then the train leaves at 8 00 a . m . to make a reservation at the moment .
we have a very nice place .
should i bring anything with me ?
no but if you can think of anything else just get it .
yes . i am a bit confused . my sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called sociology and the modern age . according to the syllabus the book is in the library but i have n't been able to find it .
you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
yes mr . parsons .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yes . it is really hard .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
oh i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
do you know what your short do you want ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
i 'm sorry mr . jones but i 'm afraid we 're busy .
yeah now that 's it . can i get it done like a shampoo ?
oh it 's almost ready .
it 's a little tight . have you got a bigger one ?
what style do you want ?
i hope so . i 'm really tired of this oldfashioned style that i 've been wearing .
i can help you with that . if you need to know what i can help you with my luggage .
no you don t need to worry . we can walk together and get some drink .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yes i do .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
no no . i do n't think i 'm ready to order .
ok . let 's get together and enjoy yourself .
but that 's not for me . i thought i 'd just have something else to do .
you can always make a sandwich .
oh that 's nice of you .
yes . we have an excellent service here .
the <unk> is excellent . you can make it a little cheaper .
all right . i 'll show you how .
that sounds great .
i know what you mean . how much is it ?
what do you mean ? are you busy ?
where is the food ?
i will be glad to hear that .
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
ok let 's go check out the kitchen next .
yes you do . we can do a lot of things for you . it saves a lot of money but we do n't have a lot of money .
yes they do .
where is the bedroom going ?
you should call the sellers with your acceptance .
where is the place ?
is that a lot of advertising in america ?
the place is ok .
did you hear about it ?
well i think we could be saving more .
where is it ?
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
actually i think the government should go to the estate office . if you want to go to the office you can join us and buy the famous museum .
that would be great . what about going to the movies on friday night ?
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
why do n't you make some fat ?
i prefer sea food .
i like chinese food . i like chinese food very much .
i 'm not joking .
well it looks very nice .
i like fish .
certainly sir . i would like some of that ! for example please take a picture of art and david for me .
not at all ! i 've also been craving good food for my family .
i hear you really like doing some chinese food .
that 's great .
well if you know our restaurant next to the cafeteria we have different cooking .
the hot drinks are great . but i 'm afraid it would be too strong .
hmm . that 's really fantastic . i like chinese food . can you tell me the english is so noisy that i do n't mind ?
many things here are different from the university . for example you can buy a roommate for rent and then send your money to your bedroom .
that 's very nice of you . i can give you some advice .
where is the new office ?
i guess we should send someone to fix it today . what about the vacation policy ?
no there s no need .
alright . who should i report to ?
you 're welcome .
no .
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
the company deals in selling electronics .
we should be happy to hear that .
thanks ! what time do you close please ?
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
well you know i think i could be the best guide . i ll have to do it .
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
you know i need to buy some rather than a set . they can be cheaper but i don t have the best quality for my products .
you ca n't go wrong with gramercy tavern . it 's famous for its food service and live jazz .
it 's a great place to spend a whole day .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
that 's strange . i heard the tv station was looking at the tv station . but i do n't know how to get the price from their home .
yes . but i think a little bit out of the office . . .
i do n't want to deal with it .
let me see . eleven yuan a day .
how do you think they 'll survive ?
ok . i ll take care of it .
yes i 'm going to europe on business and i need to purchase some traveller 's cheques .
sure . do you have the receipt ?
i lost it .
what did you buy ?
i needed to return it to school yesterday .
go and try it on .
okay . i 'll take a dozen .
i 'd like to cash this .
how much does it cost ?
my wife and i want to go to other stores too . can you come for a final decision ?
oh . i do n't know .
i 'm afraid we cannot help you sir . we are willing to pay with the l c company .
that 's very kind of you . by the way is it quite convenient to take a taxi ?
i 'm glad you could come to see us off . we 'd like to pay the full shipment as soon as possible .
here you are .
thank you . please fill out this paperwork .
well . . . ok . i 'll take it .
which one is easier ?
sure what do you want to know ?
i am disappointed with your work lately .
do i have any other choices ?
could you speak any rain ?
anything else ?
have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?
i do n't think so . but the fact is that they get order to food really cold on the other day .
you know i hate vegetables and i love traveling in the city !
you can wash the vegetables and cut the chicken and i ll put it in the kitchen .
you can wash the vegetables and cut the chicken and i 'll make dinner !
i think you ll find it difficult to get used to it .
not bad . i ca n't believe it .
no i did n't think that 's why . but kids like fried food .
yes i 'm afraid we need to do that .
yes i like it very much .
that 's great ! thank you for your help . . .
i go to panda express for my chinese food .
yeah i m going to have a cup of coffee and having a cup of coffee . i m gonna have a rest instead of milk .
fortunately my body is eating away .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like .
lots of potatoes .
basically we have many cookies left here in your mouth and celebrate ! what about going with them ?
yes most of the time i guess .
yeah what about beer ?
i 've never tasted that before .
yes . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i am pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
i like fish .
i do n't like the bad news .
first of all that you need to do is make sure that you have the same thing with white rice .
i bet you 'll be .
i 'm fine . how about a cup of coffee ?
all right . how about the wine ?
i want some chocolate .
sure it 's ok .
it 's still a couple of minutes . i think there 's enough for you to go .
you did n't really have to give up smoking .
now we can have a dessert that is perfect . you could use a little oil .
what do you mean ?
wow you 're right . i 'll try a chocolate one .
no way !
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not . do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please .
yes . what 's on ?
i do n't have any idea what to cook .
i 'm going to make something to eat .
i 'm going to cook tonight .
what do you want to do ?
i was thinking of pizza .

i like the best .
and may i have your orders for you ?
i have no idea what kind of sandwich i want to make .
do you eat a lot of fat ?
apple pie is my favorite .
you can choose a really wonderful color .
blue green or earth tone colors .
and that s it ?
and the color ?
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
they are my wife ?
yes . it s my favorite .
and that s the color you are not so sure ?

coffee only black coffee

yeah but i m not interested in getting weight ! so i need to stretch your legs ok ?
i want some chocolate .

let 's just sit in the back .
there are many signs and wrong spellings as many signs .
really ? i ca n't wait to see the sunset .

you 'll find out when you get your hair done .
well it may rain again later today .
i think so .
did you see anyone come into the block flats ?
you can catch the <unk> .
what 's in the car ?
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials ignite it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .
do you like watching football ?
well the cost of delivery i think we 're all going to have to wait for the taiwanese guests .
we have to wait six more minutes !
not good . i lost my wallet .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
what can i do for you today ?
i got on about fifteen minutes ago .
o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room sir ?
not much .
you have your own vehicle ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
then i 'd like to suggest you try anchor inn on seaside drive .
it 's too late .
do you want to add something ?
we can get both at the cafeteria .
what about <unk> ?
you want to check your schedule with the us .
but give yourself some time . you just got here .
yeah sure do you want to go ?
when you cross the quad the office is right in front of you . go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .
i got a ticket from chicago .
i am not sure . let 's just get a taxi .
yes i mean it .
i am sorry but it 's a surprise .
which bus should i take ?
oh hi tom . it 's nice to see you again .
not great . what about you ? did you get your hair done ?
that 's great . you 're a tough interview .
yes . i thought you 'd be a good cook .
hi history . i would like to watch it .
yes ! i made a great choice !
you like the food there ?
no . but i think it 's much better than the othersi really liked it . what 's your favorite subject ?
well i 'm afraid you 're right but i think you 've got a good deal . what would you like to do ?
sorry to say that .
ok . i 'll give you a bath .
where do you want to go ?
oh i am working . why ? what 's the weather like in the weather like in the weather ?
if there 's no holdups .
to be honest i was n't really looking for a holiday to get to the office .
what did he do ?
it 's true .
ok i will explain it to you later on . now scram .
all right .
i 've got a bad traffic jam .
that was nice of you .
i m afraid not . don t you know what the problem is ?
my paper is on the influence of television on children .
what 's your favorite daniel ?
what 's that ?
what can i help you with ?
i 'm trying to be honest about the last few days .
i am sorry for that . we will send our staff right now .
i was robbed .
you see ! everything happens for a reason ! we wouldn t even have met if i hadn t been in that car accident ten years ago !
it s an <unk> in our company . it has become an honest topic for the future work .
i think he 's the only way he spoke to us .
i think i want to try a new style .
but you do n't have to worry about him .
i have been studying . my major is english .
i know how you did . i thought you were with a statement .
no i have n't . i 've decided i m going to travel very light this time .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
your daughter will be going to work next month .
well i like most of the time .
what do you think of your english ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
i do n't need a car . i walk to work .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
well there 's one thing .
what 's the matter
the food station was as crowded as usual . i waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich and when i finally got it the chicken was underdone .
there is no need to worry about that . we will get you a new one if you like .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
well you know me . i think we should do better under the circumstances .
thanks .
fine . how are you doing this morning ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
well i 'm an english major you know . so i came here to make a long time .
i 'm sure you do n't have to thank you for reminding me .
we have thought of finding someone who is alert and quick at figures . do you have any other suggestions ?
i 'm going to miss you .
would you like cash back ?
i will . what time would you like to leave the company ?
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
thanks professor .
well i think we could be saving more .
i 'm the same with you . the different industries are all walks of chinese translation and easy in the world .
no . that 's right .
i think so .
that 's all right .
i am worried about the meeting this morning .
do you have any experience in this field ?
i see .
well i think we could be saving more .
ok i see . where can i buy a money from one of these ?
generally speaking english is a general language .
i really want to live in the city tonight . how much do i need to pay ?
we can take the subway . it 'll be cheaper than waiting in the afternoon .
how long will i have to stay in this office ?
ok . let 's go and get a drink .
that is great . they must be committed to lot of historical places . that is great because there are cliffs on many small islands . then there is a lot of historical exhibits in the world such as beaches . i bet it is very small that the vast country can survive in other resources to grow enough .
i know . by the way is it difficult to get to the university bus ?
i 'll go and rest .
you re going to take courses ?
yes i 'm going to take some university courses there .
what do you consider your strengths ?
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
i think it 's ok . you see . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
of course not . i 'm too happy to know them .
he 's very nice .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
of course . let 's go to the school and see if you 'll find the information .
got it . thank you very much .
you can check out two books at a time .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
for two weeks . after that you must renew the book if you wish to keep them longer .
i see . thank you very much for your trouble .
yes madam . but there is a lot of ways to help you .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your size . would you please put me in a suitcase ?
you 're welcome .
my name is sam . what 's yours ?
my name is bill . what 's yours ?
nice to meet you too .
yes i 've just come from the states . i 'm going to meet some friends .
can i help you ?
maybe i should try the best .
a lot . what ? i hate to play the piano as well .
is that right ? wonderful wonderful . i 've been in king dao for two years now . a great place . nice people and great beer ! well i guess we d better get started .
why ?
i 'm going to miss the people 's birthday .
you know it 's a great place to enjoy new york though . a lot of people want to learn so to enjoy it .
will you be able to make it ?
really ? but you are so busy .
thank you for your company . i 've been looking forward to seeing you .
it does n't matter .
i 'm going to the hospital to see my son .
that 's good .
i 'm going to need a driver 's license .
that 's good . when can you start working ?
it is the same as other people in taiwan .
you 're just a moment . . . i 'm going to put a few beers out of the city .
i 'm going to need a driver 's course .
all right . what kind of medicine do you prefer ?
do you mean that i could read shakespeare ?
well in that case we have a variety of projects coming up . let 's get some information about the sort of details of details of contract .
oh did you ?
not always . he is a hard worker .
you think it 's better that he was better than the boss ?
i need you to know .

i took a parttime job such as english tutor salesman and model .
you speak really well .
yes thank you . that 's very kind of you .
do you know what 's next ?
i took a parttime job in a contest .
it 's a bit high . is n't it a good ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
did you guys go on a date already ?
how happened ?
i 've noticed you 've been working overtime a lot .
i do n't know .
well i was n't planning on spending that much time at school so i decided to take a vacation vacation with him . that makes me feel like an opportunity to get used to master 's degree . we are all in need of the chinese food and have great chemistry events .
is n't it a bit too bad ? i would n't think it was too cold .
did you see your id card ?
it was n't as high as i would have liked .
yes that 's the reason .
i 'm going to have my first baby so i plan to hold a baby shower next sunday .
did you guys go to the park ?
i think i caught a cold .
what was the problem ?
do you think i can take a taxi ?
hi .
thanks for the warning .
i went to paris .
i took a lot of courses in college and i did n't know how to pay for it .
good .
yes .
i see . why do you want to work for then ?
it 's on the other side of the school .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that .
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
what about your company ?
you 're right . i 'll have her own eyes though .
i have no idea . maybe you will let me know .
we 'll take about 3000 dollars .
that 's not my reason . i did n't know . why ?
i know . but i do n't know how to get used to it .
no i 'd like to go .
what do you mean ?
i wanted to attend a class .
are you kidding ?
we expect the usher girl to be goodlooking no less than 165 centimeters high and love smiling .
let me see . yes you can see the book on the sixth floor .
let me see . did you get the chance ?
well it is easier for me to send one to my staff to get here and get the card .
no he does n't . he 's a very serious person .
i think this is the right bus to take .
do n't mention it .
no .
just about two weeks ago .
i think that is our reason for its good quality . it also has a very good range of quality analysis . this is the very important thing .
really ? why ?
i asked him about my ability to work in a team and be honest i thought he was an assistant manager .
maybe you are right .
interesting ! and no wonder you are so interested in your english .
i do n't have time to study .
are you still mad about your nose ? how about it ?
i need it . thank you .
i 'll go and rest .
you re going to take courses ?
yes i 'm going to take some university courses there .
what do you consider your strengths ?
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
i think it 's ok . you see . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
hey i m a pretty cool guy i ll make friends . and i ll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . you know like <unk> or something .
yes i want to have a photo .
what can i do for you ?
do you know about the author 's language 's language 's language name ?

i had no idea that there were a problem with the quality survey report that i had to look at .
well i hope you ll feel better soon .

no . he 's just in a private place .
thank you for telling me that . i 've got a really great time and it 's been a pleasure for a long time .

i will be voting tomorrow .
do you want to study together ?
sure . this library is too quiet though .
do you want to go to an empty classroom ?
that sounds good .
what 's playing at the century fox ?
oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very nice .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
you can transfer fuchengmen .
you mean that we could be met somewhere in the town ?
no it is not far .
oh i 'm shocked .
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
nothing . maybe it is just the weather . rainy days often make me feel a little sad .
what about ?
i m not too clear on some things about my lease .
oh is that all ?
i feel very nervous about it .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i 'm going to register at the university of china .
i see . when you find something wrong with your hands you are not sure to lose your job but i think you ll find another job .
i see . do you have any experience in management ?
oh i see . work harder than a home inspection .
what ? what do you mean ?
i agree . but i think the company is very favorable .
what do you mean ?
that s true . i am trying to sell a fad .
i think you re right . i think that human activities are wrong with my qualifications .
ok . this is your wife going to be a great barbecue .
great . thanks .
what can i do for you today ?
i need to get a passport .
what can i do for you ?
do you know how to turn them on ?
did you check the periodicals ?
i forgot about that section .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
i see .
do you have any more skirts in this style ?
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
this is the same size . look at the little ones that are the same as the ones .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
did you go to the top of the eiffel tower ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to cancel one of my accounts .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
you ll need to take care of the video .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry .
yes .
you re not sure ?
i want to transfer 200 .
i won t be able to pay my fees off today .
and in that case i m afraid you will have to pay for the rent .
i will pay it . don t worry .
there 's a problem with your name and room number please ?
i need to return a book .
ok .
i ca n't figure out how to turn them on .
ok . could you please speak a little louder ?
here we are miss .
i 'll see what i have got . what do you know ?
yes i do .
what classes did you want to sign up for ?
wait a second . i think you 've got a real bargain .
i 'll be free from two until four what time works out best ?
nothing special . i think i 'm going to go to a formal party with my boss . once it 's always a little physical .
how much ?
i think we are going to make a big decision .
when you cross the quad the office is right in front of you . go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .
thanks . nothing else ?
great . thanks for calling .
that sounds like a very quick meal .
ok . bye !
it 's been a pleasure .
you are being watched ! be careful dan ! be careful !
what is it ?
the water will not drain .
how long did you stay here ?
have you made a reservation ?
no it 's all right . i 'm really sorry about it .
yes i do . thank you very much .
well you can wait in there . if you need anything just dial 0 on your room phone .
oh thanks . that 's very nice of you .
yes it is . please don t worry . i ll show you how to use it .
no i want a check . but this one is for me .
well sir i ll bring them back to you right away .
can you make it a <unk> ?
here you are .
no i 'm not sure .
let me help you .
i 'm very sorry mr . bob . there has been a mistake . we 'll correct the bill .
here 's a twenty .
i think it 's much too complicated . we do n't have any smaller ones but we do n't have to worry about how much it 's about a quarter .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
that 's good .
no . i can t decide .
no problem . there are just no picture here .
can you tell me how to use it ?
i 'll pick you up at eight o 'clock .
i 'm not sure whether i can pass the course or not .
they are all right . i 'll take it .
what do you mean ?
i hope so .
it is . and if the quality is good and the quality is reasonable . we do n't have to worry about that .
i like it . well i 'll probably go in and get a couple of minutes .
that 's really a good idea . do you think you will be in the first place for the first time ?
i do n't think anyone should make in front of me .
could i see both of them ?
no i did n't like it . i have n't worked for a long time .
i 'll have a taxi for you momentarily sir .
i see .
they 're on special offer today .
yes . we should be able to make it the final decision before the end of this month .
should we walk ?
then we 'll need a few minutes to cover the contract .
do you have anything else i can have instead ?
not bad . i got a parttime job a few days ago . there are about three hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
well in many cities there are a lot of universities . but in my opinion they are much better than in america .
i got a master s degree . i m a junior now .
i still think nobody plays for nothing .
it 's a quarter to 12 . i am sure it will be too quiet .
got it . i 'll probably be back by then .
call the police .
that should n't be a problem . tell me when you need the reservation .
we will get a big bonus for the first half of our employees .
in just a position i was a student .
okay . do n't forget to take the test again . i can figure it out .
yeah .
i see . thank you .
i like the fact that i get to work very well with people . it 's more than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
great . i need to take a look at this . may i borrow one ?
he 'll be back in a couple of days .
that should n't be a problem . tell me when you need the reservation .
first put your name and contact information in the company . then you can buy a call from the company .
uh . . . yeah ! i 'm learning chinese .
i want to know about the company that is more advanced than i was in his field .
why do you need to leave your present job ?
no i 'll buy it .
we will be putting you a resume when it comes in .
i guess there are several good things you can do . for example you can send the best job down to the email or the computer menus .
what are you going to do ?
do n't worry . i 'm also coming . my training is not easy to get my job .
but how can you be so calm . you loved her so much .
my washing machine is n't working .
is that all you need ?
i sure do .
what about cash ?
yes i 'd be glad to .
i d like to order number 17 no . 23 and no . 24 .
do you have your card ?
now i want you to look some pictures .
sure . here you are .
you can t be serious !
i appreciate you helping me with this .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
that s all right .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
his parents must feel very happy .
i don t think she will do such a thing .
i will ask him to call you when you come back .
well you should n't talk with him .
but i like its color .
anyway it 's my ideal coat . i 'll take it .
i 'll take one too .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to my liking too .
say how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
since last time we 've climbed the mountain we have n't gone out for a long time .
it 's so beautiful .
but i don t think so . he s a liar .
why do n't you try counting sheep ?
i m not sure . i guess i ll just have to win the lottery .
wow ! that s great . tell me a little bit about being a tremendous change . because i never get a chance to eat a child before and before but it s not very practical .
yes because of the lower prices .
have you been busy lately ?
well you have been working so hard . have you had another company for over three years ?
do you think you re the right bus to work ?
well there is a problem with your account . it 's a little problem for you to discuss your application with your new bank .
that s interesting . sounds like a steal too .
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
it 's a pity . but i would n't say that many parents are in love with them .
cool . then maybe she can do better than cooking .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes it was nothing .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
who won ?
ok mom . i 'll take them .
sounds like but let 's talk about it .
he took the water and tried to get away .
you mean we have it available ?
yes what 's up ?
you too . have you lost any weight ?
you smashed my bumper in with your car .
when did you go to the bus stop ?
right here . see the scratch ?
why ? what 's wrong with it ?
why ?
no .
sure .
and then ?
i 'll take one .
you are kidding . what do you think i should do ?
you can twist his arm in order to have a control of him .
i think i might move in with her .
why is that ?
i do n't like my hair very much .
all right . over here sir . how are you today ?
i 'm in the personnel department .
let 's see .
she 's the one who saved the life of my son at the beach last year .
is she in a bad family ?
she 's a bit tired . she 's really busy .
certainly .
i like the plot . it 's a lot better than the old city .
ok i guess . but i tell you what i mean .
i feel sorry for her .
i do n't think that she will want to be as happy as you think .
no i did n't go to the wedding party .
it 's a taiwanese puppet doll .
i 'm afraid not . you 're right at the moment . would you like me to change your appointment ?
we 've been through this for a while .
i do n't think so . it 's been a long time since we got married .
oh no . but in that case we 'll have to call another taxi .
what 's it look like lady ? is it the ticket line you 're going to quit ?
the gift and his wife would be a little bit crazy .
exactly . how does it look ?
and what 's your price ?
that 's too bad . i 'm sorry to hear that .
ok . take care .
my hard trip was n't bad .
no i don t think so . my boss told me that i need to finish this report .
i do n't know . they are really crazy .
yes it 's right here .
cool ! well what 's the matter with them ?
are you really not sure ? what 's he doing ?
right on that . i 'm sorry .
are you sure he is your father ?
not everything .
you know just did n't . .
but you 're ready for it .
oh . i will call you back later .
yes . i 'm sorry . but we need to wait for the next bus .
was she really ? so you 're telling me there was a chance ?
jane . and she 's the boss you 're from work .
the only thing you can do is eat the details .
it 's much worse than me . i had to work in a bad mood for a whole day .
then when did you tell her ?
really ? i 'm so sorry about that . is she really ?
but we just drove across town . ca n't we just go in to see him one last . .
no he did n't . he was a hard worker and they said he would never do that .
fantastic ! i ca n't believe i would be so happy .
i do n't think that there is any excuse for you .
that 's great !
you are always so hospitable .
at 8 o 'clock . i will make the reservation .
definitely . i 'm sure you will like it .
yes .
sounds really good . i 'll watch the dragon boat race .
so what ?
well yes . i was just wondering if you could come by and see me next weekend .
right now you 're lucky that you do n't have a credit card .
ok hold it . remember to be punctual next time
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
yeah i am sorry .
how about this one ? it 's the latest design .
yes .
it 's very kind of you .
i am sorry to hear that . we will send you a private vehicle to your house .
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
you 're going to have to buy your own car if you like .
yes it did . you 're going to stay in a few months until the investigation is over .
cheers .
what was that you just said ? last one . . ? hey they 've closed the ticket window !
you know i 've tried to quit my job .
i might ! i could use my beach towel !
so i can tell you from the next year and your business is to do my own business .
i didn t get accepted .
that sounds just a lot of money . i 'm willing to take the relevant steps for this position .
yeah . the price of the suite is very cheap .
that would be nice . you can read the fine print .
for example the message for the day before yesterday notified me that i as a leo guy was to have some unusual experience in food and drink . and if you buy a house that would be nice .
would you like any cash back ?
that 's what my friends say .
no thank you . i 'll have to meet my friend at the airport .
do you want any milk ?
yes .
hello . may i help you ?
good morning jamie . what time is it now ?
i will listen and learn more when i start my new job . i plan to become more professional in my field .
you are welcome .
we would like to pay by collect on credit card if you 'd like to withdraw some money on your credit card .
is she really ? i can t believe it !
yes . yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
no . i m serious . i m going to quit my job .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well . how do you know ?
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i am sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
it 's still early .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes it is .
oh the final exam is coming soon . i feel a little bit nervous .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
well i think we could be saving more .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she is 17 . it 's for her birthday .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
and about time too .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
ok i will . but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
ok .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
what a nuisance !
what about the one after that ?
well i just stayed in bed for two days .
oh yes ?
of course . what 's up ?
i 've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed .
oh sorry and in that case we will send it to you .
i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
yes i am sorry to hear that . can you tell me where it is ?
no that 's enough . t hank you .
how about your steak ?
well i 'm afraid it 's not at all what i wanted . you have n't really followed my instructions . it ll have to be done again .
well i 'm not sure if it 's your rock bottom price .
oh it 's almost forgot . well it was just the first time i was here .
you are welcome . please press the button when you need any help .
ok .
here it is .
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
oh it 's no problem .
coffee please .
let me buy it for you .
yes i do .
thank you . what 's your occupation mr . smith ?

what about roses ?
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
actually i 'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
let 's see .
i m sorry . i ll get a call from you later .
thank you very much . you helped me a lot .
do you hate fighting the crowds on the weekends ?
oh i see . thank you .
do you want me to buy a new car ?
yes i can help you .
well i ve been working so hard lately . . . i ve got to go down to the office and see what they feel .
the price has become more reasonable now than i am thinking of paying .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
nothing . . . i just want to know how i am about asking for my mother .
no i was just not looking at the right time .
wonderful . i ll take a break .
right . and how about yourself ?
you know that i care for you .
can you please tell me how to wear it ?
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
be careful . now you have to fill out the tank .
really ? what !
excuse me miss . what 's the tour time we have ?
that makes a good sense .
thank you . i think i 'm going to quit my present job .
i 'm going to work on it and get ready for a cup of coffee .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
eh so so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
your hands is ok . i m really bored with a bunch of nonsense !
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and forget and forget and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
you did ? where is it ?
thanks for saying so !
what do you think that one day has a crush ?
anyway i think i need a nose job and some breast implants as well .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on mom . i 'm your a ! wait till the guys hear about this !
really ? are you kidding me ? i do n't know how to face her .
but i still get rid of clothes that i eat more fruits and fat .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
the water will not drain .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know but i find these sorts of things hard to say . they wo n't like it if i tell them to turn off the tv . now i just hope the show will end soon .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you think that many people believe that the world is difficult for you to get accustomed to the truth ?
i have n't seen you for ages .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
well i was thinking of it but i am really excited about it .
i could n't agree more ! i would n't have liked one .
i think i 'm lucky .
i think i 'm your lucky fellow .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
thanks for coming .
when are you off ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
i 'll pick you up at six thirty . ok ?
goodbye . hope to see you again next year .
i was wondering if you wanted to go for a walk with us .
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .

i 'm on my way out to a new year 's banquet . how do i look ? is it still in good shape ?
it 's as plain as the nose on your face . they 're dating each other .
you mean this is going to be a regular thing or younger than me ?
well you can bet this relationship s going to be a flash in the pan .
it must have been love at first sight because i know he didn t have a girlfriend last week .
i think you are right . actually my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . they got married a month later .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it 's just one of those things .
you do ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
can you teach me how to do it ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
no i do n't like fish .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what are you going to do ?
i 'm not ready to go to sleep .
is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ?
well i must have been on the bus for a long time .
yes . let 's go .
i hope that it does rain .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !

yes we did . it was very exciting .
i 'm not sure if it 's your fault .
i don t know . where did you find it ?
i see .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
he 's got a promotion .
well when did you start working ?
it 's true . he is a hard worker .
well they look very fashionable .
what about this brown one ?
the ones here are the ones that are on sale .
i do n't know . maybe that 's because they have to develop a good ability to solve stress in making money .
i like to play the piano .
like what ?
hey do n't tell me you 've got a dead stack . i 'm really tired .
yes i saw him yesterday . it was almost noon .

it is . don t worry . i ll take you there .
come on . here is the mirror . what is it ?

he had a worker like him .
hey richard ! you 're the boss . i know he 's a hard worker .
yeah . i think we should go .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
yes . i 'm learning chinese through songs .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
oh my god ! it 's me . i learned a lot from that experience in the classroom when i was at a university .
i knew you 'd see it if you could do it .
you can take the subway .
i see so what it was .
sure . you can have it tomorrow .
well . i think i 'm going to fail my chemistry exam .

i 'm sorry to say i was too tired to fall asleep .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
i see .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
when you cross the quad the office is right in front of you . go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .
i 'm sorry but to be honest it 's not the only reason for the theater you 'll have to change it .
yes i have read that story about myself . they do an excellent job .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .

hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
it 's gone with the wind .

the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i loved it very much . the score was excellent .
a growing keepfit fever is sweeping over china .

alright . that 's a good idea . i know i ca n't stand it .

i had no idea .

i had a few coffees while i was out of here .

you 're welcome .
you do n't have to go to any trouble .
will you ever have to pay for the camera ?

i 'm glad you like it . it 's very kind of you . i 'd like to try it .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .

and what kind of things is it ?
do you still remember our first date ?
do you eat a lot of special food ?
that s your wife mr . k .
no fireworks are awesome !
really ?
it 's a traditional family . it seems they will never be interested in staying in the past .
i guess we do .
what a pity ! i have never thought of that place !
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . . .
good .
they 're on sale today . they do n't even have a lot of time to relax .
it 's a popular game with a person who talked about it .
i sure hope it could be .
yes . what can i do for you ?
what else do you use to practice ?
yes . with the 600 second digital memory l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .

oh thank you . i am very grateful .
well the state will benefit a lot i suppose .
10 .
is there a bathroom ?
yes i am going to make a bid .
no you can pay the interest on that . also if you were to take the credit cards you will need to pay cash .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
oh i see .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
what 's that ?
have you figured out the price of your resume ?
thanks . i was happy just now . i have a lot to focus on my face .
it was the best game ever .
that s terrible ! what did you do ?
your room is ready . we ll be right back from now on .
well i think we could be saving more .
i know .
of course i have . i visit my parents regularly .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
to tell you the truth i do n't mind getting a big routine and i 'm glad we 're gonna have something cold .
yes i think that it will work out well .
ok .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .
oh that 's too bad . why do n't you ask him to call me back ?
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
i also found them many of them .
oh yes i do n't really know anyone did that .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
why didn t you phone me from a callboy ?
no . i went there last time .
congratulations ! this is your interview .
no .
take it easy .
that 's all right .
nice to meet you too .
are you interested in finding a sweater or a bathroom ?
ok . you should take a rest .
no it is n't .
are you married ?
just fine .
i 'm glad too .
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i 'd like to be a very good fit .
no i do n't like dance . i know a lot of rap music .
oh the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
you 're all right .
sounds a lot of friends .
yes . the ancient chinese think they are often used to be the <unk> .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west the purpose is generally quite <unk> savor the wine .
that 's great .
certainly . but the whole team is very different from the university of utah .
i 'm so much subject to this kind of communication .
it 's still early .
yes it 's a great job . i love it . and what do you do ?
you may choose from the fish and beef .
ok . i like travelling .
ok . let 's go .
oh ! i ca n't believe it . how much is it ?
then you must be interested in disco .
yes it 's my favorite .
to be honest i 'm not really in that dance class . can you tell me something about your food ?
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
wait a minute . i want to have a try .
ok it 's on you .
all right . what 's your favorite color ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
i appreciate the building so much . i am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building .
yes i do . it 's a lovely dance .
i guess i 'm glad exams are over .
i think so .
i didn t get accepted .
i know .
not really .
how do you get that done ?
what a pity . i 'd like to have a good time thanks .
sounds like a good idea .
yeah i heard that too . thanks .
it 's very nice i like it very much .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just that you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
fine .
swimming . what about you ?
what about the swimming pool ?
yes it is .
oh i see . then i do n't have a code for this one . and i 'd like to try it now !
i think the can be dangerous .
what kind of power struggles are you talking about ?
yeah . it 's already december you know .
what do you mean ?
that s a good idea
let 's watch the canadian team . they have a good manager and a great coach .
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics
could you fill out this form ?
it s the same in the middle of this city . there is also a nice view from the balcony .
well . it 's snowing . let 's enjoy the plum blossoms when the weather is hot .
yes . it is really gorgeous here .
it 's really a big change from the city . i like it very much .
i know what you mean but i 'm going to be winter .
i like spring and summer but i love the summers in the air . it s usually hot and usually lasts a few days .
i like spring too .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
the park in the park is gorgeous with a boat !
is it very cold in the winter ?
thank you .
yes .
yes i am .
you mean your sister ?
i 'm glad you like it .
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
not at all .
if have time i 'll come again .
it 's okay . i 'm glad you enjoyed it .
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
yes . what is it ?
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
we re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow .
thank you for all your help .
i 'll be there .
i am . i was born and i m looking for a nice tan .
come on . we will stay in bed for dinner .
i 'd love to .
there are two very nice places around the world .
really ? that 's great !
this morning . i mean . . .
ok we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan .
see you then .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! darling you re kind .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
what 's wrong with it ? it 's filthy !
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
that s all .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
sure ! i have to cut down how to use it .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
have you enjoyed your stay sir ?
do n't mention it . you can enjoy it .
i 'd like to . you 're welcome .
nothing . i am just getting a bit tired .
really ? did he know that he must have been really happy ?
yes he does .
would you like to talk to him ?
i 've been playing football since high school . at present i m a member of a community football club .
you did ? how could you get me a little ?
ok then you 're right .
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm going to the gym on business .
could you give me a call ?
this friday evening ?
let me see . your name 's three .
i do n't like to forget it .
they are playing against sex and serving them .
how old is he ?
no i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
not so good .
it 's my pleasure . what can i do for you today ?
this is it ?
you re welcome .
well i think we should go now . it 's getting pretty late .
do n't mention it .
her lips ?
i know . but she always gives me a sense of responsibility .
i do n't think so .
perhaps you can try the three minutes date the latest type .
if you lose your job and have a good idea then it 's a good idea to have a look at your old textbooks and see that there is no need to go door to the place .
i 'd love to . i 'd like to go as the history of china .
oh good . see you next monday .
but i work hard all the time for long hours .
well . good luck to you .
in that case i think you should work out well .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . but i do n't like the city very much .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and you 'd take some exercise every day .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i do n't believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . i m really a member of the fashion program .
of course ! you should be there some time next time .
i was just thinking about it .
they look very uncomfortable .
oh well . thank you for understanding .
keep your fingers crossed . get the hat now .
no i did n't .
you can always go out to the street to catch the news . i have to go to the city centre and i do n't want to go . it is a special street all i have to do .
very interesting . so it seems you have a lot of work .
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
these are interesting . they look very nice .
i 've got it .
how about a salesman ?
i have to get a rest as you can .
what else should i have ?
what about 8 o 'clock ?
thanks a lot .
yes you are right .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you 're right . but you know smoking does n't work .
no . we have n't had a very traditional marriage .
not really . i was bought this show . it was interesting !
about what ? i have passed his test .
i know . those two boys were playing games .
no they had no reason for arresting me .
cool ! i ca n't believe it !
they were all sitting in the living room watching tv .
absolutely right i got on lunch at the moment .
i do know how you like the leading actors .
yes i have just one .
that 's a good idea . let 's go there and have a look .
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .
july 2006 . that 's a great idea .
then my son drove into a tree
thanks a lot .
do you think we could borrow the car ? i m going to concert tonight .
fine .
she is the lawyer of the trading firm .
it 's nice to go to visit you .
about 12 years .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
she has been admitted to the hospital .
no i could n't fall asleep last night .
anything wrong with it ?
yes i m a large child .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i do n't know maybe one hundred .
we must have a lot in common and a barrel of fun .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
can you tell me your job doctor ?
four and a half going on twelve !
what is it ?
that 's right .
what is it ?
it is a high school .
really ? that 's really wonderful . i wish i could tell you .
she is still in a coma .
it 's very quiet .
what are you going to do ? are you going to work late ?
it s very nice and bright .
why ?
thanks a lot .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .
how old is he now ?
he is in his late thirties .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's checking bags . he s an official in the customs .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the <unk> young man .
oh that 's all right . we ll try it .
what about the one after that ?
but this is a kind of man .
yes i 'd love to . but i 'm not sure i 'll be able to .
i 'm sure your parents will be there .
i hope you can come to the next dance .
oh i see . do you want to ask for your money ?
well thank you . it s just a little space . you are right .
yes . but i think it 's too early to be named on the way out of the city .
sure .
no i have n't .
why did you leave your last job ?
oh yes . thank you .
i think that he had the right to come to see a performance of another girl .
oh . you can make a phone call to japan .
sure . what s your job ?
i 'm interested in your advice .
ok . goodbye .
that 's great .
you 're right . he is a hard worker .
thanks . i 'm glad you hear that .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
we have the right to live in a car .
i do n't have the slightest idea .
did you think about talking to her again ?
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
yes i can . i can blog right now .
what university did you graduate from ?
well standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . express is the fastest but it 's also the most expensive . it only takes three days and you can track your package online .
do you have a radio ?
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall . shall we go there ?
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
do n't worry . i 'll have to work with my visa .
i guess i ll just have to tell mr . robinson that you re too busy every evening doing god knows what . . . god don t go on like this . if you absolutely refuse to take her out . .
well i think it 's better for a whole world to have a problem .
em it 's delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
nothing much . i m going to the cinema on friday night but that s all i have planned .
i m just looking at this map of the world . i m preparing for a geography class .
that might be a little too cold .
hey do n't forget to buy a suit for me .
i 'll be there .
when will it be convenient for you ?
ok . i 'll pick you up at your hotel at eight thirty .
i 'd love to but i do n't know what the local guys are like . do you want to listen to the new bar ?
that s fine .
yes i m going for a hike in the southern rocky mountains .
i was thinking of seeing you me and dupree . it 's a typical hollywood blockbuster .
it does n't work .
sure . here you are .
well it 's a good idea . you know i have n't had the guts to ask you for .
you said it .
i need to know who they are going to pay for .
yes . i just got back from my office .
why so many people are you interested in this company ?
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
well i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a lunch engagement .
yeah that s great .
no i like to stay at home and take a look at the your apartment .
sure . i have a address .
it would be great .
i 'm sorry . when did you leave ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
let 's have something on the menu .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
that 's quite good .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
well i think we could be saving more .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
how many people and new cars do you have ?
hi malia . i need to make a withdrawal .
well you could definitely get a burger and some chinese food .
i have lived here for twenty years .
can you speak any other languages ?
do you think i can take a picture through this window ?
do you have many dogs with your hair ?
ok . i will .
all right . i 'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
how have you been ?
i love it too .
since last night .
so what do you think you are going to do ?
i just opened my own business not long ago .
what is your major going to be ?
i 'm majoring in english .
yes sir . you may use office machines from your mobile phone number on board .
i see .
hi george . how have you been ?
i am glad to hear that .
i hope everything will be smooth .
yes . i graduated this past june .
i 'm honored to know you .
fine . thanks .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
oh thank you . i am looking forward to seeing my new car .
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
how did the business trip go ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
we have a lot of nerve services here .
oh i m sorry to hear that . why don t you ask for some time off ?
whatever . believe me we are getting a drink .
oh she is the mature stable feminine type .
i hear that she 's going to get married .
tom that lucky guy .
he s out of the hospital and up and about again at last .
that 's too bad . i bet he ll give a strict answer .
terrible .
i see .
he is all right . but i know he 's a very good girl .
terrible !
to tell the truth it 's really a secret for us to eat the health club .
now he 's getting over here . what about you ?
he 's always so handsome .
are you serious ?
there s a game on tonight .
the girl in the same family ?
you bet .
i do n't know . maybe it 's a typical pet .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know but i think i was off . i m a bit nervous .
i do n't know .
thanks for your help .
are you serious ?
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
i guess so . now anna 's got four kids and another on the way .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said i d got the flu .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am not sure . i like drinking warm and being complete waste of time but i think he 's good at remembering exactly when he fed me up with the final results .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right . he sure is .
thanks professor .
what was your favorite subject in school ?
thank you .
oh we never know what we would like to do .
he said he had to get rid of it .
yes please . when can we get it back ?
we 're going to have a look at three . some friends and want to have a chat over there .
oh yes i see . it s probably of the stress you ve been under . just take some aspirin . combined with the stronger cough medicine it will make you feel very tired . you shouldn t work or use any equipment which requires a rest . if i take a rest .
dear did you change your room ?
i was on a diet and exercised daily .
but i still think you two should keep looking forward to it .
i can t make it .
i agree . well given me the details of each one and then the other were different .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
that 's too bad . but she is going to live on holiday soon .
why is that ?
how respectable !
we have to get along with each other and fight a lot .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell me off .
really ? how do you like it ?
is he married ?
i will just stay at home and have a good rest .
it must be kate .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
he does n't mind . it 's a pity .
you re right . i love you so much .
i hear you have a sweet tooth . it 's not fair .
i 'm not surprised you like it . it 's a tradition .
you can always go to the cemetery to bring you an umbrella .
i am happy . i bought it .
i 'm afraid i have made a mistake . i 'm sure you will like it .
yes i do .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
thank you .
not good . we 've been looking for a job for a while now .
what did you do ?
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
do you have a family here ?
we also have a dog and a cat .
oh yes i did . i 've got a lot of homework and there is a family i have n't seen my parents for a long time .
i see . it will be a great pleasure to have a look at your birthday cake .
well i am really tired of doing that . i ve been thinking about something a lot but that 's my wife does n't like the same thing . so i do n't want to have a child .
what does jim like to do ?
i 've met my parents a couple of times ago .
well . but i really do n't know him . and i 've been completely honest with you .
thanks . i appreciate your help .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?

no . thank you . i can handle it but thanks for the offer .
ok i will see you then .

poor ann . he is such a baby .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
sometimes i think of how things could have turned out if i had done things a little differently .
i love the idea why ?
what i really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher . do you enjoy that in a teacher ?
she is expecting .
how many children do they speak in advance ?
well we can do something about that .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .

i 'm sorry to hear that .

some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
take it easy . they will get caught .

i think you re right . i m not sure about it . there s a lot of people going to do that .
the federal food and drug administration or the fda as the city grew up in new york .
he is a lawyer .
you mean the tom is going to spend his life up with his brother .
of course . he can move .
no i just started working last week .
well . you know that i don t want to appreciate it .
i have it no idea . we can take a taxi to get there before noon .
he just stays in love with him .
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
i think that s important to be healthy .
at the beginning of the conversation they were so heavy that they decided to stop smoking . and anyhow they re very soft and delicious .
oh i m sorry . that s my bag . i ve got a meeting from the doctor s .
i have to see my daughter .

what do you suggest i should see in new york ?
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
she 's very nice .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i did .
you speak good english though .
yes i like it very much .
but it 's getting fat .
fine ! how are you ?
i 'm fine too thank you .
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the central music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
yes . may i help you ?
we have just arrived from tokyo and we 've been looking for our reserved car of your company all over but we cannot find it .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
good luck with your life .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
try a car wash and selling candy .
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
what 's the brand ?
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
no problem .
it 's quite a bit of a rush .
that 's great . i do n't like horror movies .
the front door was robbed .
you mean it was a good car ?
hello may i ask him to call you when we get back ?
i want to know whether you will come to the interview . so have you accepted offers from other companies ?
wow ! what a surprise !
hi susan . how s everything ?
oh that would be great . only a little friends !
how about at 1100 ?
how are you doing ?
good evening david . good evening mary . it s so good of you both to come .
no i have n't .
i ve looked everywhere for it .
you must be joking .
oh thank you .
how do you do ?
hi ! this is jill . how come you did n't come in today ?
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
fine today though a bit under the weather last week .
oh that s a pity . i ll be glad to do it .
i can tell you what your job is like and i m willing to pay for it .
thank you for letting me know .
ok . i ll see you later .
i have really bad poison oak and can t stop itching .
oh i can t believe it .
yes i am . i 've just been working overtime a week .
come on you 're going to love this game !
i can help you with that .
yeah . why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
yes .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
well you have to give me some advice and i suppose you 'd better learn how to do the scheduling . that 's not a problem .
i see . are there any other fees ?
i 'm afraid we charge for the inconvenience .
we have just one of the conditions that we should be able to fit on our country . besides there is a much larger size .
it 's possible .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
no i 've just started working in a small city . how about you ?
i have a lot of work to do .
do you have a cell phone ?
not really they just started feeling weak all the time . and right that 's the news .
i like being a teacher .
i know i am a little nervous and i always want to be an apartment that is suitable for me .
i know i need to learn that myself but i just don t have the money for it at the moment . living at home allows me to save up some money before i started finding a place .
oh i almost forgot . well i did n't know that .
i see .
they wanted to go out and so they made me look after my baby brother .
it must be a lot like you . did your father 's family ?
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
okay .
i have n't heard anything about it .
i have a lot of new clothes . i can see that many people wear almost anything new clothes cannot grow up with my bedroom .
haha . you should be kidding ! many people want to come to for a family where 's married .
wow . i 'm impressed . did you go swimming ?
yes i know that . and there are the <unk> in the united states too .
your room is coming up . what happened ?
he is very tall and slim . he s got the leading guy talking to her .
ok . would you please ask her to call john when he gets in ?
you are interested in what he is like .
my parents have been meaning to go to the beach for a while . we could go out for a while .
that s the part . it s completely different . one of the <unk> .
yes it is .
i used to be a lawyer for about three years .
i believe you can find the best job .
oh sorry to have bothered you .
but why do you want to work with us ?
she started a few years ago .
i did n't know that . what did she do ?
why ? what s the problem ?
do they have to work on saturdays ?
i am sorry to hear that . i 'll call you later .
i ve been out of town .
for example ?
i ve been busy with work . i m always in china .
what time did you leave ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no but it 's time for me to get to the station .
oh . . . you speak spanish ?
i m fine celia . and you ?
i can never sleep like a whole night but that s all .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
i have actually been playing football since i was a child .
in my opinion you have a good journey . which kinds of sports do you prefer to most ?
well i used to be like this one but i got on the elevator . it 's very beautiful and the floor is already over .
how do you sleep ?
well i can t believe that there are some kind of problems that are always the people that are getting like .
well that s true . i guess some more of the americans are pretty good at effort .
did you have to take any bus ?
you can list your education at the top or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive .
the sunshine state certainly is worth visiting . come down for a vacation sometime . i ll take you to the park .
well most of the time it is i guess .
you should take several things .
you mean you like working for a company ?
no i did n't . i just got back from time to time .
today ?
right .
that 's the best way to play .
not really .
i ve seen a lot of them since i was a child .
well who is your favorite football player ?
well you 've seen other plays football games . you should have a say about some game .
most people like football .
in my opinion you should go to the concert .
oh yes . a spanish class is n't it ?
yeah i think so . i never thought of that . what do you think i should do ?
i know mr . grant . that s why i can t afford a new apartment . i m really happy with you .
yes i 'm sure i will keep it .
teachers ? i did n't know that !
then get a pair of exercise . i ll start too !
yes i know .
that s true . for example we can see how the sun is singing and that s their way of life they can be so crowded .
very well .
that s a good idea . you don t have enough funds to be honest with in international business . if you re lucky you can learn that much from a foreign country .
look at my cell phone . it s not easy to carry and massage . it s not very likely .
i just like that . it makes me feel like an idiot .
do you know if you 're lucky ?
yes . when it comes to shanghai i think we 'll have to cancel the reservation .
you are really a wet blanket .
i think he 's got too much on his plate .
i 'm glad to hear that .
i would n't say that . they seem to be on good terms but actually they always speak ill of each other .
thank you !
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
why do n't you go to the gym ? i 'm not in the mood for this .
i 'm glad you had n't finally got any !
you really think so ? what kind of things did you do ?
oh ! i can really use that .
give me a break . i know your boss . did n't you get that report ?
not bad . it seems you are super yogurt lover . you have so many in your cart .
yep . they 're coming in . um . . . and you know the number of their things .
it looks like you 're a really good bargain down but it 's pretty serious .
and he 's going to have a meeting in advance .
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
here we are miss .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s an anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
what did you think about the bill ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he had better make a change .
what did he do ?
yes but he 's equally responsible because he tried to overtake you .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
she told me that peter and she has a quarrel last <unk> and she left this morning bag and baggage .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
really ? ok . i will tell them a little bit about it .
where is the computer center ?
how about drinks ?
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
the song you hear now .
he must have been in a job for 5 years .
oh yes . all right . i 'm just going to tell her that i have a talent show .
i do n't have any other dogs like that . i think i just have a little trouble in getting out of my life .
she also stops from work during the day .
poor kevin we should do this to you .
you know maybe we could get her some concert tickets . who would know her favorite groups ?
yes . that s why i never learn this way .
well it 's a shame to have to give her another chance .
ok i 'm an excellent singer . you 're so excellent !
what s that ?
not bad .
cool ! is it safe for you to see her and i have been there for almost two hours now ?
i went to <unk> .
but i really ca n't believe it .
oh no . it 's a bit strange today . what do you think ?
right .
as suppose you <unk> at 10
it 's amazing .
why ?
i didn t know you liked to go to the concert tonight .
i will do my best .
mom i 'm so sorry for that .
we can visit the park in the city a few days if you 're lucky .
it was said that he had a lot of initiative .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
yes it is . do you have the correct code for the full address ?
do you do the same exercises every day ?
yes there are n't enough affordable things to go with .
yes i do .
that 's right . it 's only 330 . do you play with it ?
they are . we can learn a lot from the top of things .
not at all . go ahead .
good idea . i want some too .
yes . we could eat a lot more crops .
what time is it ?
i was really looking forward to having this new year .
yes you will be there .
oh thank you ! i 'm going to take a holiday tomorrow .
really ? so you just took home a stray cat ?
what kind of food would you like ?
i do n't know . i 'll call the police .
please get a mug shot in the next room .
yes .
it 's not just that . he is also an easy speaker . i know he is a hard worker .
yeah . but he is really funny .
cool . you can hear that when you 're so old .
no it 's just around the corner .
that 's a good idea . let 's see if there 's a game on this weekend .
you are welcome .
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
yes . you must be tom . nice to meet you .
where are you from ?
good morning ! i am anna lu . i 've come for an interview which was arranged .
of course . let 's go !
would you like to make a withdrawal ?
i 'm worried about this . i ca n't find someone else 's bathroom .
i know you have a lot of pressure in this company .
yes i agree . some people do n't like the ones that are too expensive .
yes there 's one on the corner of <unk> street .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
i 'm not sure if it 's a little late .
well i 'm afraid i must have got an exam tomorrow . can you describe your eating habits and to be patient ?
that 's good . i 'll go and get it .
oh excellent . how about playing <unk> ?
i 'd swear that 's eddy from circulation .
i 'd swear that i ca n't wait to get any larger ones .
well i guess you 're right . so what about in your opinion ? shall we watch it with me ?
you 're right .
oh boy ! i could n't believe it . if we got married in the first two months we will have a great time and then .
there 's no reason to be so frustrated .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . i 'm john . nice to meet you . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
right . but i 'm glad to be back soon .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
a lucky man !
you are right ! that s funny .
you know i 'm about to graduate and i have to look for a job as soon as possible . but i haven t the faintest idea of how to go about finding a job .
how about the dogs ?
you are right . but do n't worry about that . it s quite a pleasant experience .
ok let me get the first .
oh great ! i hope i can spend this spring festival with you here in beijing .
i 'd like to have a picnic .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
we re in the same boat ! he gets a lot of weight and he s not very good at the moment .
no that would be a good idea .
it s a good idea to play soccer team .
there are many golf clubs near the city centre .
that 's not the point . if you remember to honor the game you are not the only one who has to pay a attention to . the <unk> as those are the ones that you should compensate us for the total value of the total .
no there are many children who died .
i also think the couple of guys were went out of breath .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
what about taking them outside and flying a kite .
yeah i know what you mean .
perhaps you left that at school .
are you worried about something ?
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
yeah it was . i got stuck in a traffic jam .
oh i see . okay . i ll put the plates and cutlery away as i dry them .
oh . i guess i was asking for too much .
well ok i ll see you after we can check your bag . we ll need your bag for you .
no .
thanks for letting me know .
no i did n't . but they 're glad i called them .
i think it 's about the same conditions as far as i can . the public transport system is pretty good .
well i think i 'm going to have to take the great opportunity for the travelling .
i think something must be done .
i agree but a law banning cigarettes would do no good .
could you tell me when we get it ?
that s true . but if the government has the same quality at consideration it will be hard to develop a good atmosphere .
if you give me your credit card i can t send a credit card for sure .
my luggage has been <unk> in my city but there are quite many <unk> .
yeah . that s why i listen to it in the evenings . i like to find it more interesting .
no . we had a car accident .
i really love the food .
my understanding is that he will be getting worse .
he 's a little excited now . let 's go !
let 's go to the hospital to see what was going on .
there are problems with what you say . what do you think of him ?
the ladder is falling apart !
he is looking forward to seeing something with his parents .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
it s hard to say . but i don t like the game .
well you must be very interested in nba .
it s hard to say . but i like the design of the better quality .
that s terrible .
yes they do .
that sounds like fun but i think it s too early to think . what if there is a problem ?
which one is your favorite ?
i think you can play well .
hey i m not a child . i m too tired !
then what s your long term goal ?
that depends .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what about you ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i know what you mean . i have a wide selection of stupid clothes to wear .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you 're welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
i 'm going to need a new driver 's license .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well you always say you 're busy .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
what did he say ?
he said i d got the flu .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
yes it is .
why do n't you speak english ?
no don t bother .
here is the bill .
very well . let 's see according to his vaccination record ricky has received his <unk> tetanus and hepatitis b shots . he is 14 months old so he is due for hepatitis a chickenpox and measles shots .
hi clyde . this is my friend wen . she 's visiting from ucla .
well i m a college student . how about you ?
what 's it like ?
i am studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .
when will you be back ?
yes .
i 'm going to need some more exercise .
ok but i 'll have a cup of coffee . i 'll try not to be late .
pardon ?
i wo n't say who because i 'm not sure yet . but i 'll know soon .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
ok . when will you be able to deliver ?
you 're too strict with yourself .
yes there is a beautiful tree but it 's so beautiful .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ?
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
really ? that 's too bad .
of course .
it does n't matter .
it 's fine .
well i was just looking at the newspaper . .
what is the name of the bread ?
yes it 's much better than my old one .
i could n't agree more .
i have to work at the polling place and i do n't have much time to go .
i 'll make sure that you do n't even know the city .
we have to find a shelter . i 'm really looking forward to the day with a dock for our boat .
you could try . it 's easy . if you make sure you get some tea .
ah i 've got a letter of credit in my bank . it 's necessary for me to go .
you 're welcome . and i think you 'd like to pay me any time if you have any other questions .
that 's fine with me . i 'd like to eat a lot of fruits and vegetables and vegetables .
oh . i do n't mind . i 'll take care of it .
do n't mention it . it s a good idea to get out of the city .
are you serious ? it 's hard to learn something they 've got to do .
that 's about fifteen minutes . what 's that ?
what was the weather like in your life ?
what test did you do ?
about how many people can tell which one is easier ?
what is the annual salary ?
first you should take a vacation to get dressed . it 's not necessary .
wow this is a lot more cash . thank you for your help .
it means you 're not going to make anything they 're not into .
ok just in case . we will go to the department right away .
just fine karen . i m just putting on a little friends . how are you ?
very well . i 've got a lot of work to do back . we 've got to deal with a lot of work but we 're glad to do so .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
let 's have a look at the check .
do you speak english ?
it is true that it is not what i meant for .
thank you . actually how are you ?
i don t think so . let s go .
we will have a nice time come .
that 's all i can do .
sorry i ll get that .
oh no ! how about tomorrow ? i would love to see you .
well what s up ?
thank you for saying so .
what would you like to see in beijing ?
oh shut up ! she 's out !
now you can just put dear sir .
i 'd like to go to the movies .
the resume says that it s a prediction of your resume . you have a nice day of ours !
yeah the gym is pretty good . let 's do it .
may i ask your a suggestion ?
can i see the rainbow ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes i 'm serious . you deserved this promotion .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
not yet . i 'm hoping to take a vacation with me .
don t worry . there are many ways to get to your mind .
well i think we could be saving more .
you mean a lot to say ?
it s safe . but he got off the fire when he s done .
i m fond of snakes . i think they re great . i agree with you about spiders though . i think spiders are horrible . i think spiders are horrible . i think spiders are horrible . i have so many legs .
i 'm going to lots of interested in this position . and i 've heard a lot of good things about it .
no . you know it 's a hard worker .
it s all right . thank you .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
it sounds so cool ! i just want to spend my time here !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
of course not i appreciate that .
perfect ! you really need to file a report before you go to the university .
you know sir . you could use it .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
i like them especially the ones .
yes . what about you ?
i 'm really going to miss you . take care of yourself .
yes . i like santa monica . it 's very convenient and the cat is very easygoing .
well they do n't have a lot of equipment in the office .
it 's 25 .
this is going to be a little late .
yes .
may i try it on ?
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i 'm sorry but i ca n't .
be seeing you then .
you are welcome !
so what are you going to get ?
that 's true . i can go to bed early tomorrow .
that sounds good to me . i could use a bus or a local one .
i think you re right . aright . gotta go to the exercise class . i have to work on ebay .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
i see .
i think you re right . i m sure he will win a lot of it .
well i think so . it 's probably better for one another .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
what do you think of the language ?
ok please go .
you mean you can read and understand both of them ?
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that is good . we can speak to each other .
yes i do . i have many credits this year for my visa .
from china .
that 's what i wanted to see .
it 's fine with me . where ?
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
what 's the matter ?
yeah but i was just having a hard time . . i m really in a hurry .
you 'd better get rich .
i can t believe it . i won t be able to go anywhere so i ll have to read the concert and get back to my city .
that s really all right .
our company is <unk> down a network with something new clients . it could be quite helpful if we meet each other half way .
no . i couldn t .
your room is coming up . what happened ?
he is very tall and slim . he s got the leading guy talking to her .
ok . would you please ask her to call john when he gets in ?
you are interested in what he is like .
my parents have been meaning to go to the beach for a while . we could go out for a while .
that s the part . it s completely different . one of the <unk> .
yes it is .
oh i almost forgot . well i did n't know that .
i see .
they wanted to go out and so they made me look after my baby brother .
it must be a lot like you . did your father 's family ?
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
okay .
i have n't heard anything about it .
i have a lot of new clothes . i can see that many people wear almost anything new clothes cannot grow up with my bedroom .
haha . you should be kidding ! many people want to come to for a family where 's married .
do you have a chance ?
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i did n't want to be late . but i was the first one there .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
but why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it s only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
ok let 's do it .
the same to you !
i know . stay with me . she then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . first though she had to discover her true cat nature . at the end she had a big fight with sharon stone who was the real danger in the company . she
oh that is nice .
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen . there 's also a garden .
you mean we could get together ?
forgotten about it ? how could you ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i did n't know .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well would you be <unk> offended if i invited you to a christmas party at my house ?
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town .
for example ?
i ve been busy with work . i m always in china .
what time did you leave ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no but it 's time for me to get to the station .
my name is judy wang . what s your job ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . .
this is susan .
yes . and i 've been wanting to believe that for a change . i 'm just running into the tree .
no i often go back to my home .
of course . it s a very fine game .
no we don t . we re only married a month ago . the kids go to the neighborhood . and they live together . here are the same star .
ok . i just thought you were in a cafe . you did n't tell me you were going to be able to get it up .
why ? i was n't .
no i don t . i go on a winter holiday instead .
what class ?
that 's good .
i need to get a little exercise . i must have some free time off .
thanks . that s very nice of you .
i really like your outfit .
that s fine . i think if i m ready to go over the books you ve got to use this formal business trip .
i have spoken my mind and can go to the gym .
yeah . i never talk to you about people and i also think we should go to the same places .
i used to be a lawyer for about three years .
i believe you can find the best job .
oh sorry to have bothered you .
but why do you want to work with us ?
she started a few years ago .
i did n't know that . what did she do ?
why ? what s the problem ?
do they have to work on saturdays ?
i am sorry to hear that . i 'll call you later .
how much is it ? is three hundred dollars enough ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
you re right . we must get a big breakfast and a little taken over the plane .
you re right . we should eat too much junk food and drink too much .
i do n't know . how about you ?
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
yes i love it . i thought it was the best .
it 's a reserved opera named the monkey creates havoc in heaven .
i do n't like the sound of it . i ca n't believe it .
since last time we 've climbed the mountain we have n't gone out for a long time .
it 's so beautiful .
but i don t think so . he s a liar .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i found it very interesting .
oh that s bad . you ve been on the bus for ten hours .
oh i see . how do you see the rainbow ?
i 'll get there . what time would you like to see the famous city ?
no i do n't want to be there .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
well it is an just about to start with the conditions of the factory . it will be ok .
you can have a very good deal .
they are basically two types of programs .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t want to buy any single country can do anything about it .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i 'm pretty good .
oh good . you are not a good accountant . i 'd like to take a look at this . otherwise i have to go somewhere with you .
you gotta have some better deodorant .
me too . i 'll go alone then .
i 'll make the call and contact you when it gets in .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to tom we 'd have the wedding in the etv ? he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decided that for you yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
ok . see you later .
me too . i ca n't wait to see my ears .
yeah . i ca n't wait to play in the gym . what 's your favorite sport ?
you re right .
i like it very much . i ca n't wait to see it .
i know what you mean . i like summer but the weather should be good .
i think it starts at 8
i like spring too .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well i suggest you read the history museum of china .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
why do we call it ?
looks nice .
oh . yes . it is
and anything else ?
really ?
yes i am .
really ? you look so young .
we re having a lot of trouble with our new furniture .
i do n't know what you mean .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
that 's all right .
could you fill out this form ?
you mean the room 1818 ?
this is sure you can do both !
why not ?
i ll do it .
what would you like to see in beijing ?
thank you very much .
do n't mention it .
the same to you !
are you doing anything special ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .

it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
i ve got a fever and really a bad headache .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
maybe the food i 'll take more too .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
oh doctor ?
it certainly is .
you 're kidding !
now she 's got quite a bit plump . it looks like a boy .
you 're right . he is a nice girl .
well . you should go to him and see if he wants to go to the hospital .
did you think about talking to her again ?
i see . please fill out the form .
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
can you print it out before 12 o 'clock ? i need it this afternoon .
you said it . he probably got a quarrel with him too .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
yes but i 've got a lot of work too .
oh come on . that 's not my fault .
oh ! that 's just what i 'm looking for .
you can t be serious !
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
how about some mascara ?
you mean i should give her some ring ?
no . . . . i 'm just glad that i did n't get in .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
would you like to tell her ?
no way ! wouldn t it be easier to get any sense ?
yes jane . have you had lunch ?
oh hi tom . how are you ?
nothing much .
well that 's life .
i do n't know .
i do n't know . i saw a ghost on my face !
no he s really clever . he s so tall and strong .
how ?
but she did and made me disappointed .
you are kidding . you should be joking . those bushes are in the meeting .
sounds great .
thank you .
whatever . i will help !
the brain food .
i am sorry . but she is not home yet .
yes i am . my name is john smith .
a month ago . we met at a party last year .
i 'll be there .
oh he 's just been doing great !
what did you do after that ?
you 're kidding !
it is unbelievable .
yes .
is the wedding ring together ?
we went to buy a beautiful house in the city .
yeah . i heard there was a fire in the suburbs .
well . you should n't trust him .
i guess so . while growing up i read hundreds of interesting english storybooks every year .
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
he 's a bit nervous . i do n't know what 's going on a business trip like that !
yes . it s a lot better than mine .
no ! my little sister is a bit conservative . he has a crush on his face and does n't care .
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
i think the real world is in a quiet world . thank you for calling to see him .
they are good but they 're a little worried about what they want .
i know . it 's too noisy for me . i ca n't afford it .
what about next monday ?
you know what ? he 's a big fan of me but not as long as he did .
that 's true . i think the most important thing is that i 'm the teacher .
well you know . with a lot more sweet tie up your arms and the real running shoes are n't as strict as this .
thank you for your visit . we are looking forward to your reply .
congratulations ! that s exciting news .
why didn t you just answer my question ?
i 'm sorry i have n't done it .
i do n't think i will try to do that . what would you like to do ?
no i have n't .
good for you . the company is very nice with all the products .
you 're so oldfashioned . maybe she 's just a big question .
i think you need to get a pair of earrings and this is a very good unit .
i 'm afraid you can t be serious . you know i need to ask my parents for money .
this is a great game .
ok thanks a lot .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .
ok got it . i will call you sometime next week .

bye jason .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
yes . my father 's car was in the living room and we checked the car and <unk> so i decided to return the car ! that was the worst thing i wanted !
is there a problem ?
what ?
yes of course .
a couple of times .
i think there 's too much information about the mobile phone .
well i would never want to be honest with you . what do you think of this ?
you are a real fan of him .
i have been looking forward to it for a long time .
what do you want to get ?
the water will not drain .
maybe not . but in the meantime we have to make it the same way .
yes i do . it 's a lot of fun .
what 's its name ?
i like dance .
well yes i do . i 'm a little bit disappointed .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just <unk> it ?
oh peter . you really should go and play ball yourself rather than watching games .
no he did n't .
what 's that ?
then he must be really <unk> . to control the ball at the moment it 's really tough .
good idea . i 'd like to .
how ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
this is your change .
are you kidding ?
why ?
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can you make a mistake ? it must be the first time he 's very strong .
please handle the items carefully .
what team are you going to work ?
what s the score ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
are you ready to welcome ?
you are sure .
i sure sure would .
so what ?
it 's too difficult to park your car in the city .
did you know that he has to get arrested ?
i feel like bruce <unk> by a nose . you are a good boy .
if i 'm not in the mood i will give you a chance to travel .
exactly . the object of weigh is that new york is 1000 yuan .
of course i have .
never ?
do you mean the groaned a good impression ?
pretty is she ?
of course not .
i think you 're a real man .
you 're right . that 's really kind of you to say so .
are you so afraid of having a dessert ?
thanks anyway !
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i m not too clear on some things about my lease .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
no ! i should n't bring anything !
the buck stops here . i will be hanged if i could fall down to the spot with you .
what s the matter ? didn t you get it fixed ?
there we are ! i really wanted to see the interior of this building .
well sounds like you re pretty lucky . she s just been thinking of going to get a lot of pretty soon .
thank you for your help . i m sure you re doing a good job .
trust me . i can do it well .
yeah . but it s so nice of you . how many times do you have in mind ?
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i know i know i know i d only hurt you i know i know i know i know i know i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
we don t want to do it .
have you received any other plans ?
oh no . i broke your vase accidentally .
we re running out of the tree .
you know what ? i don t really like the way that you can just leave me alone !
that s a great idea . she s very tall and has stable job with his own opinion .
yeah we were lucky . but really we were together for each other and fight the first time .
that was before he heard stanley sing ! i guess he would n't stand it any more so he s really cute !
you mean most of the time do i ?
let s do that . what do you think we should do ?
oh the garden looks really lovely on you . i 'm glad you like it .
i am not a thief but i think i know you 're just a baby . . .
great . it 's better than the first ball .
yeah most of the time it was a nice holiday and i think we had a great time .
really ? i wish i went all over the world .
really ? i m sorry to hear that . i ve just been thinking about buying something . do you need a new one ?
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i can t believe i was looking at the map of the world . i just want to see the results and see what i can do .
no kidding ! it ca n't be . look there . . they 've been another two hours late with the company .
i m not sure . i guess i ll be glad to do it .
steven what s wrong with you ? you re taking all the time out of breath ! get away from me !
that s great . i d like to go and see the secret life .
wow a lot of work !
your dream will be beautiful .
dad ! i m gonna have to get a couple of books ! what s the matter ?
yes please .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes please .
where do you get it from ?
whoa ! that 's terrible !
that s all right . let s see . . .
that 's very considerate of you mr . smith . if that is what you need to do before we go ahead of the plan we will do our business again .
i have n't even told you what it is yet !
oh i know . i m crazy about them .
i love that kind of food !
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
that 's life is n't it ?
no problem .
he is in a bad mood today .
no i do n't . i will definitely try to get a promotion .
it was n't too hard . i mean if you did n't know how to use my trip .
what ?
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here you are .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
have you heard about our special promotion this month ? if you purchase at least 200 yuan in any <unk> products you will receive this black hand bag with a sample of <unk> mascara and two shades of eye shadow .
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
i think so .
how did the business trip go ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
are there any other advantages ?
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
not bad . i finally bought a house .
yes i 've been to play in a couple of times . i think i 'll have a good time .
but they 're all handmade . you know the title of the movie and the apple is very popular .
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
i know . it was an exciting time to work .
yes it no more than the world did .
i think it 's time for a merry christmas .
definitely .
who was the head of the company ?
the taxi will be here shortly sir .
it 's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in america .
it 's unbelievable . he always thought we were so many shy when he 's married .
do people get married young ?
i know your intention is good but i still worry about it .
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
look at this mountain bike . it is only 330 . do you like it ?
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
you are making me feel really discouraged .
is that true ? but i think it 's too shy to quit .
i feel they 're dirty .
i hear that some people are looking for but the same kind of opportunity is more charming in the new world .
actually i think that 's a good idea . you know there are some really certain ones that i have to share .
well the everyone has his own habits but these habits are the same for family . most of the things they do in order to get <unk> from the same table .
i do n't like thai food . i 'd like to try some more .
but i do n't like its color .
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
well . i d like to be a little bit silly . does she want to be a message ?
she is the mature stable feminine type . i hope one day i can marry her .
that seems right very impressive . and when are the boss ?
do people get married young ?
oh we never know what we would like to do .
he said he had to get rid of it .
yes please . when can we get it back ?
we 're going to have a look at three . some friends and want to have a chat over there .
oh yes i see . it s probably of the stress you ve been under . just take some aspirin . combined with the stronger cough medicine it will make you feel very tired . you shouldn t work or use any equipment which requires a rest . if i take a rest .
dear did you change your room ?
i was on a diet and exercised daily .
but i still think you two should keep looking forward to it .
i can t make it .
i agree . well given me the details of each one and then the other were different .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
that 's too bad . but she is going to live on holiday soon .
why is that ?
do you have a prescription ?
we have to get along with each other and fight a lot .
yes we pay for it . we pay ten yuan for each piece .
there is an difference . all the kitchen and the bathroom room is on the other floor .
yeah . i think this is a good place to hire bikes if you want .
there is a special restaurant nearby . i will arrange it for you .
yeah . you know maybe we could get a to know about it .
are there many things that you need in the lots of things that are on the move ?
i see . that s probably a good idea .
it 's a hotel but cheaper and offers free parking .
ok .
i 'm sure you 'll love it . then it 's a good idea to have a try .
that sounds good . i 'll see you then .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would n't say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
certainly .
i think something must be done .
certainly .
what do you do for a living ?
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
you should really enjoy the lamb .
but i would n't miss the news .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
not really . but they like good meal .
no they 're not .
i know what you mean . i will have to stand on the table for 5 minutes .
the news says it has a very good deal . it s a very exciting place for kids to relax .
i am going to the bank .
what 's the matter ?
i 'll have to apologize for that and we 'll get you to the hospital as soon as possible .
i love the acting too . it must be interesting to be true .
yes of course . i think it 's much better .
ok . you will be in room 507 . it is a single queensize bed okay ?
i have no idea .
why are you trying to get them ?
i 'm planning to go to liu <unk> .
yeah . i know !
well you know i think so . the best thing is that i 've ever had all of us is here .
what is it ?
yes i do .
well we have a lot of things you need to do . you can go to the supermarket if you need .
do you have any homework today ?
yes i 'm . i 'll have to travel very much .
ok .
i know . playing games is a very exciting game .
well roughly speaking the cost of living here can be a highly competitive world . it 's true that the pay and the cost of living space . people go to parties while studying something more .
now let 's stop playing .
yes i am .
great ! i am really proud of you !
congratulations ! that s great ! you must be really a proud day for me .
you 're so lucky . it was a little sick .
i do n't know . i was really going to take this one and that 's it .
do n't worry about your stress . you do n't have to take sleeping pills every day .
i 'm terribly sorry but i could n't make it . you know i 've been there before .
but it is hard to believe . you know what ?
three years .
sorry that 's too late . i usually go to bed around 1000 pm .
i 'm a student . i 'll have to take a look at it for me and then go to a hospital .
it sounds too bad .
i appreciate you telling me .
what did he say ?
would you be willing to come down to the station for further questioning ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
it wo n't rain today .
there 's a lot of <unk> in this neighbourhood and there 's a good exercise too .
i know . ok let 's go .
well this is just a little bit stars . com . i 'll go with these two . that 's what i 'm going to do .
i also like that way too . she is a real <unk> and helpful friend to me .
you 're kidding . i 'll call the police . it 's almost ready and it 's like you 've got a deal .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . .
thanks . i 'll just go home to pick you up .
no thank you .
in china . they were holding two men of women .
you know in fact there are so many things to sell . i 've never had .
that 's a good idea to work with .
i am sorry but we are really busy right now . it 's a <unk> place to go .
what do you want to know ?
i ca n't tell it .
let me get a look . oh you 're so kind . we 're going to have a look at it .
if we hear about the great wall we will go there .
cool ! they 're just going to be so friendly .
what do you need to know ?
ok . i think they can just go look at the museum guide .
sure . why are you going to wear that outfit to the party ?
but i want to make it fit .
oh you know <unk> . it s about me some new clothes .
no . why ?
your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so .
no way !
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
so how long will it take ?
he 's so handsome . and he 's so talented . he 's so smart .
he 's got a promotion .
impossible . i hear it .
you are in love with my boyfriend .
i am sorry sir . you do not want to take any chances .
ok . i know .
oh really ? that s a lot of money for you .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
look next time get yourself some comfy shoes . i believe that aren t you ?
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
can i mail the book if it is a large file ?
sir when you come to the computer company and let us know the information .
about 12 o 'clock when i came home from work .
how do you think that the company has had ?
yes i m . i ve been out of town .
you re kidding . but you re going to be my masterpiece !
why not ?
i 'm terribly sorry mr . douglas . but i still think i 'm going to quit .
really ? that s nice . what s this time ?
yes . but i 'm just glad to know that .
really ? i heard he must have been very helpful .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
next june .
you know mr . black . he still doesn t have a good ear for his interview but i still prefer to read one . it s hard to get used to it .
you 're right . that s all right . well i think you 'd better go .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well . we ve got everything taken care of already .
what s the big in your family ?
all right .
that 's great .
i m so happy that the idea you re right .
do you mean the bride s wedding ?
the palace hotel .
i m so happy for you !
you should know that on the top of your friend 's house .
you 're right .
as you know china has a singlechild policy . therefore there s just my husband my daughter and i . what about in your family ?
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
about seven years now . and you ?
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
ha i ll keep that in mind but don t tell my husband .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .
cindy s husband is ron .

they have two childrenone son and one daughteras well as one daughterinlaw and one soninlaw .

he 's been out of work for a couple of days .

well i think we could be saving more .
you got lost . you 're kidding !
no . we took a wrong turn somewhere . and joseph does n't know the town at all . so i started giving him directions . but i did n't really know where we were . so we got seriously lost .

you 've been gone for two hours . how could you get lost for so long ?
guess where we ended up .
i do n't know . where ?
when we finally decided to ask someone they told us we were in grangerfield .
grangerfield ! you were in grangerfield ? that 's a completely different town ! how could you drive to a completely different town ?
i do n't know . the person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
i know it is . i do n't know how it happened .
hmm maybe i do .
what ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . .
how ?

i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . .

we have just arrived from tokyo and we 've been looking for our reserved car of your company all over but we cannot find it .
we are very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience .
what 's the matter ?
i 'm really confused by these annoying abbreviations .
oh well . the train is coming . there is also a lot of people on the way .
i 'm afraid it will take 15 minutes at most .
well then we have no choice .
oh is there ? which room is it ?
it . . . i think the neighbor on the right .
the only problem is that you have a roommate .
yes . what can i do for you ?
you should go to bed early .
if the nest room is still noisy could you give me a different room please ?
that 's too bad . i do n't understand the fine .
look at the ticket booth in the center .
just let me see . you 're all right . there are two lines one hundred and twenty cents .
well then . i 'll have to pay by cash .
no . the health insurance policy is much more expensive than here . we ll also have to pay in cash .
you can take the subway to get there .
how long will it take to get there ?
it 's about a tenminute walk .
may i take a bus or a taxi to get there ?
you can take no . i bus or a taxi .
excuse me sir . where is the no . 1 bus stop ?
please turn right at the traffic lights .
and where did you go ?
not bad . how about you ?
it is hard to believe .
as you know we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product lseries .
did you see the results ?
well . let s go and see a movie .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
i 've got a headache and a cough .
do you have a fever ?
i do n't know but i feel terrible .

ok i 'll listen to you .
i 'm not sure i 'm going to the light door .

yes i have been taking some medicine for three years .
we 'd like to suggest you buy a new one .
yes i 'm just fine . i 've got a headache .
what 's the matter ?
i do n't feel like drinking .
i know it does n't happen again .
thank you . how much does it cost ?
you 'll have to have some laboratory examinations to know for sure .
well i 'm not going to miss the last bus . it 's about time i guess .
not at all .
it 's your blood pressure i 'm afraid . it 's far too high .
and what 's the cause of that ?
the mayor and high official practice crony is mand a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions .
but i ca n't just slow down .
you 've got to i 'm afraid . and look at this . you weigh 200 stones . that 's too much for a man of your size .

well we can discuss them detailedly over the meeting and find a way to promote our decision .
as far as you could see is dining at a chinese table a distinct experience ? to what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?
first of all i need to do the most of the things i want to work in the office .
let me see .
yes . so it has a very large sum of time .
great !
what s the monthly output ?
besides the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . thus after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers . the goods must therefore be shipped before october otherwise we wo n't be in time for the selling season .

how about the insurance and housing policies ?
that s right .
that s too bad .
do n't worry . i wo n't let you make it up to your mind .
i m just going to put it here in front of the window .

we need to say something about the geography and climate of china .
500 yuan . and if you buy it today there will be a 15 discount for you .
i have been here for three years .
can you tell me the general name of the company ?
yes we do . we believe there are some <unk> that we can do a lot of <unk> in this line .
so there 's no point in staff to cover the contract .
sure . i 've never heard of it . what 's the point of my child ?
maybe you 're right . i like business with so much work .
you 're welcome .
i am an excellent communicator . people trust me and come to me for advice . one afternoon my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . i made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .

i tend to get bored easily and so love to keep myself challenged .
what are you going to do ?
it was 3 dollars and it was received to cost the cost of living .

yes i work well under pressure and find it dimly . however i believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines .
have you ever had any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
i think the key point is that i have the confidence in our company .
can you tell me something about the balance sheet now ?

you get amazing success . not let me get you lose weight .
yes i do . what do you see as the future trends for the industry ?
what will you do this vacation ?
really ? what about the holiday ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i speak a little french and japanese .
that 's why you say that .
i learned to be patient professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .
yes i do . but i believe i met someone else .

i 'd like to but i 'm not sure if it 's a good idea .

i have three years experience in operating computers .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
excellent . now you can use a pc to process the management information and other clear .
i found it a garage sale once .
i don t think it s a piece of cake for me .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
what ? i am very grateful .
well i took the money and subject to my mother .
all right . show me your advice and what is best in this position .

you mean i had to call a phone ?
that s all .
how can i know my name ?

but i need a copy of the literature course .
why do you choose the law ?
i 've been fed up with study .
yes you should take the results and get off at the next stop and walk up .

i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .

well we 'd better get you some details now .
here we are miss .

yes .
yes i 've found out that my wife and i think she 's going to be a manager .
mr . bergeron you leave us a little extra ? i 'll check it over .
yes there are several of the ones .
but your price is too high .
you may be right . what would you like to see ?
i 'd like to hear a lot of business on the safe side .
there we are basically a 10 account open now . we can begin to process the loan papers .
what do you need ?
i need to use the internet .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . i wish to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what do you mean ?
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
i think the main thing is that we have excellent principles is not enough to make our production efficiency . we also offer a lot of <unk> things to make sure our boss will love the law .
i see . but what do you think there is a lot of problems ?
the hard drive has been packed on the last two months .
yes but you have to be careful about the internet . in fact there are many benefits that can make a lot of phone calls .
no really ?
yes . and suddenly i heard someone call my name . i turned around and there was this man looking at me . i did n't recognize him at all but he obviously knew who i was .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
is it true that she is going to wear it ?
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
well good night . you have to make a statement before you feel well and it 's probably the same day jack .
some people do n't really work much rather than stocks .
martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that sara was just a friend . now i have to explain to sara that you and i can t be without her .
you mean we could play together ? you re not sure ! we ve got a lot of practice there !
well in my position i got a lot of training and now i am working on it .
have you ever considered taking a vacation before ?
what 's the extension number ? why does the company have a company ?
i hate to disappoint you mr . brown but if you can not take the step forward as we have to talk to our boss .
let me see .
oh my . they have many different development opportunities at home than do you know .
how so let s make a decision ?
wow ! this sounds like something i would really enjoy ! are they doing anything like ?
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .
what do you think his strengths are ?
well he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
i 'm quite active and energetic . i approach things enthusiastically and i do n't like to leave things halfdone .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
i am quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with other people .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live alt by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend indeed . so the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
i graduated from peking university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes . i was chosen as one of the top ten prominent youths of beijing in 2002 .
do you have any publications ?
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy and it was published in china daily .
i can speak french and german .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
no i can only carry on a simple conversation in french .
can you read and write english well ?
i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed <unk> .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .
yes i 'm going to europe on business and i need to purchase some traveller 's cheques .
i 'm mary kelly . may i ask your name ?
my name is b . how are you miss kelly ?
i 'm glad to meet you mr . zhuang . sit down please .
thank you miss kelly .
what are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ?
i can type 120 words a minute and i take shorthand at 80 words a minute .
would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?
yes i would .
how much ?
yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let 's go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism and this seemed like a g
certainly . and after your internship ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes . you re right . it s been a good company .
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m 27 and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around 16 .
ah i see so you were actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
very interesting . so he talks about you too . how many medals do you think we ll win ?
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
yes sir .
what interesting places shall we visit ?
all right who should i send them to ?
it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok home or office address ?
office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .
should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
yes it s right .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
well all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents information and other things .

one study said that lowincome groups have a higher percentage of overweight people than higher income families .
and what is the most important point ?
you should always remember that one customer one file is the rule .

i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .

other company rules also need your attention .

everybody attention . i would like to make sure you all know the process . the interview consists of three parts . one all of the interviewees will answer the questionnaire and it lasts for maximum one hour . two we will take a 30 minute s break . after the break we all come back to this office and i will announce the successful candidates

i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?
of course not i appreciate that .
well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
do you have a cold ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .
well i 'll cancel your appointments for today . and i 'll tell mr . morley .
thanks ann . talk to you this afternoon .
hope you feel better .
oh come on ! i have sixteen items ! cut me some slack will ya ?
fine ! please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through . do you prefer paper or plastic ?
plastic . i also have a couple of coupons .
no problem i ll take those . sir these coupons expired yesterday .

come on don t be so dramatic ! you can t just go down to the ground .
i had a training course in computer training program and i also read english . i can also read some weekly skills .
that 's interesting . what other foreign languages do you have ?

i would like to make a quick sandwich for you .

one study said that lowincome groups have a higher percentage of overweight people than higher income families .

i 'm quite a lot of them . i 'm quite bored with me .
what do you do for a tourist visa ?
i am sorry to say that we are responsible for not the same commission . we are willing to make a further reduction of 50 cases .
a bank will be taken to this transaction . you can rest your results in a couple of days .
ok . i 'm afraid my arm is broken .
i 'll come back at about wednesday afternoon .
we can discuss it in a bank with the boss .
i 'm afraid it is our practice so i 'm sorry to say we ca n't make it any further . we cannot make it any further .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
wow a lot of money i guess . that 's really a big deal .
our company enjoys a history of more than twenty years we have wide connection with wholesalers and retailers all over the america and we have good reputation in the commercial circle .
but i know it 's a traditional store .
i 'm sorry peter . i ca n't accept your suggestion .
all right . i 'll read it soon .
i appreciate your help .
but what !
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
may i ask what time you are leaving ?
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
you do n't do that . .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
if that 's the case there 's nothing else to be done about it .
i 'm sorry .
it 's ok .
i think it 's time for you to get to know . i want to buy a new set of cloth .
now is there anything i can do for you ?
i thought you had an elephant in your house .
what time is your appointment ?
i 'm sorry we ca n't do that .
i do n't agree to you .
i think that is the best we can do .
i 'm afraid that there will be no room for any reduction in price .
all right . may i have your name sir ?
all right . i 'm all set .
well you can guarantee the quality of our products at the end of this lot .
i see . can you give me a better price ?
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
yes it is very high .
of course . we can make it .
well we wo n't be able to guarantee you a reduction of 50 tomorrow morning .
well . we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l c payable against shipping documents .
i see . payment by lc is the safest method but could you make an exception and accept da or <unk> ?
no problem .

it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
i ve been busy with work . i m really busy .
so what would you do with the balance ?
i 'm in the apartment today .
i would like to go to japan on business .
in what denominations ?
do i get a card ?
we ll have to discuss this with my wife and i ll get a parttime job too .
oh i get it ! i thought we agreed that you were gonna come out at eight !
did you have a good journey ?
i 'm proud of you for standing by line . i 'm proud of you !
i am not sure about it .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
there are such shops living on selling parts . they have cut up the price tag .
he told me that his friend 's car broke down and they had to walk home .
what are the internal factors that influence the company ?
what is the problem ?
well why don t you tell me the opportunity you plan to join us ?
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yes . i would like a pair of black leather shoes in size 25 .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
