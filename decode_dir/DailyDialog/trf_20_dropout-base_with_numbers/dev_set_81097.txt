here you are .
thank you . have a nice day .
i would like to speak to the director of human resources manager .
no kidding ! we 're so sorry for the delay .
turn right at the third light and then go straight .
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
no i could n't .
you could pick up my keys on the sunday night . ok ?
are you sure ?
hi .
certainly . come on in please .
how about some fish ?
put your job experience first if that is more impressive than your education .
oh okay i 'll take a look .
if you agree to the problem then the utilities will be closed .
can i move the car before the lease ?
no i 'm afraid you ca n't . it 's <unk> .
what else can i get for you ?
yes i 'm sorry . there is nothing inside .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i would like to buy some flowers please .
i 'd rather not . it s out of the question .
great . here 's my visa credit card .
it costs 200 .
why do n't you send it by mail payment order ?
the dress is ok . you can have a look .
no i could n't .
you could pick up my keys on the sunday night . ok ?
oh well that 's just a few minutes walk to my office come around and see me now .
is it far ?
i think a cab is better .
oh excellent . how long does it take ?
you 're welcome .
sorry . i m afraid that i can t get it out of the skirt .
i like miniskirt .
well . cantonese food is rather light beijing food is heavy and sichuan food is usually hot and spicy .
it 's very light but i think i 'll take it .
i prefer the novels by hemingway such as the old flowers in the dark . i also like the main course .
you 've got a point there .
it looks nice . how much is it ?
yes . i think it is very difficult to consider .
i like one taken half length .
well we can wait for the assistant to help us or we can look through the boxes down here .
thank you .
i am sorry but we do n't have any more skirts in this style .
thanks .
i know but it 's full .
i see . then what 's the color of your suit ?
i 'm looking for a sharp dvd player .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let 's measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
it 's a <unk> color tv .
ok maybe you can try this one on . it 's yellow .
not bad .
all right . do you want me to show you some ?
i 'm not very particular about the price . but i think the color itself is better than the others .
yes . the fitting room is right over there .
how about an outlet ?
sure . are you wearing any makeup ?
how did the business trip go ?
got it . to whom should i report ?
yes we do . we need some kinds of boxes .
what s the national anthem ?
my house has a lot of homework to do .
i understand . you want to turn the computer ?
you re kidding . you re in luck .
i see . what 's this like ?
alright .
just send them to your office phone number and tell them to sign up for it .
i would like to use the copy machine .
yes . what size do you want ?
no i do n't think the blue dress is good .
you know we are here at the moment .
it feels all right . but if it were a darker color i 'd like it better . this seems like it better . do you think you could get me one ?
yes .
oh yeah ? who s the director ?
the same to them .
oh yeah . he s a good idea and there s a girl in my country .
why not ? it 's in the refrigerator .
there 's nothing at all . but what 's the difference ?
i 'm not sure if it 's the one i 'll just take it .
you re kidding !
what other kind of food do you like ?
we usually eat chicken pork and beef . you eat these meat a lot in your country too do n't you ?
no you should n't have as much as i have !
i 've heard that people in your country like mutton chops .
that 's right mutton chops taste so good we eat them with sauce have you ever tried ?
yes i have i tried once when i visited your country last year i think they were very tasty . can you cook them ?
i certainly can . if i can get some from the butchers i ll cook them for you .
that sounds great . i 'll bring a bottle of wine .
i think so .
good . i think i 'll work with you .
just something . i 'll go with these two if this goes on and i 'll go with these two .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . . .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . . .
what style do you have ?
what 's the difference ?
i believe it s going to ms . wilson s office .
i see .
hmm . that sounds painful .
hmm . that s not too bad . i think i ll take it .
yes .
are you ready to transfer tomorrow ?
i 'm sorry . i did n't see it .
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
that 's great .
okay . i 'll make a call at you .
no . do you want to go ?
there are various kinds of music . look at this counter . it 's different .
i only want to give you a few more days off .
i think i 'll take it .
yes it does .
yes . i m just playing a basketball match .
what if she told me you were n't happy with your girlfriend ?
about three times a week if i can .
what 's your salary ?
i 'm gonna introduce myself .
i 'd rather you didn t come to a game .
i like tennis very much . it 's a real game .
do you think you can teach me ?
your id please .
i know . i figure as much as i can . they re definitely true .
i agree . that s probably something else i expected .
maybe i should have told .
it is unnecessary .
you 're right here bus station we are in the center of the city .
could you please tell me when we get there ?
thank you .
of course . the palace is quite simple .
but i have never been in this city for a long time .
i 'm afraid she 's out .
here you go .
you 're welcome .
let 's make a reservation .
you should get off at the first shi da stop .
i 'll take two value meals .
would you like anything to drink ?
i 'll have the baked salmon .
i think we have a special promotion for this . would you like to have a small dessert ?
i 'll have tomato juice and lemonade .
how about some chinese food ?
yes a medium coke .
he is in his office . he has introduced the money to his project manager after work and then he will charge you a project .
yeah . the problem is that he 's got no promotion .
if you want to be a politician ?
yes i did .
you forgot ? you . . .
i know i know . but there are so many people here .
about twelve hours . where do they go ?
would you like to go to the library or at the station ?
just do n't take it home and get your id .
i 'm terribly sorry . i 'll get you a new one .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
yes i had a flight before ten .
i 'm not sure .
i promise i will .
yes . there are two different ways .
i 'm sorry . there is no other way .
it only takes 45 minutes .
how far is it ?
you 're welcome .
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
that d be great but could i have a cup of tea first ?
sure i ll just go put the kettle on . why don t you have a seat on the sofa and i ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .
i see . well i can help with the chores while i m here . you two could probably use my help .
that s very nice of you to offer . here s your tea . be careful it s still quite hot .
the traffic lights is down this street on the left .
is the restaurant on the right or on the left hand side of the building ?
you know on your way to the mall . and i ll go there with you .
what about april ? april has good weather that is n't too cold or too hot .
it s about fifteen minutes walk . that s all .
thank you very much .
you 're welcome .
sorry but i m not really that interested in those things .
well they are very nice you know .
really ?
yes .
oh i do n't care about that .
everybody is buying them .
are they ?
yes they re very fashionable you see .
i am afraid i am not interested in fashion .
yes . there are the huangshan hotel and anshan hotel nearby . and you can take a taxi to go there .
is it far ?
walk down till you see the first lights . it 's cross the street .
it 's on the third floor . turn right when you reach the hotel . the elevator 's right there .
oh well . i 'll have to live with it . what else can i do ?
oh it s really far .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that might be going overboard a bit . how about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing .
that s even better than the real thing .
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than 100 you get a 50 voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
sure . the fitting room is right over there .
i 'm looking for a sharp dvd player .
hold on a second please . i 'm sorry . he has gone out .
no . i 'm not .
did you need any help ?
would you like to have lunch in the morning or the afternoon ?
she 's in the garden jane .
yes . throw her out .
no . last time i went to buy these goods . they are all out of stock .
can you describe their taste ?
yes .
well the waiter makes the cocktail for mr . bellow and hands into the savings . here is the tea .
it sounds like it 's a little troublesome .
why not ? i would love to try it .
thank you !
is it close to the cafeteria ?
how much is it ?
that 's good . i 'd like to make a reservation for hong kong for the next two days .
how about this one ? it 's the latest design .
no thanks . that will be all .
how would you like your coffee ?
just coke will be fine .
would you like some ice in your drink ?
room 1019 .

ok boy . i will buy it for you .
before he made the top three i was so nervous . i just fear that he might be knocked out .
that 's fine .
i do n't know . i 'm just trying to get the clothes .
what do you want to have for the main course ?
yes i suppose i do n't like it very much .
i am the hr manager of the abc company . you are on the list of interviewees . would you please come over to have an interview ?
french restaurant is my favorite .
oh i see . do you have any teas ?
how about at 1100 ?
good .
thank you .
yes of course . i 'm very happy to know that .
sometimes we use the local newspaper . there are clear water prices in our country . but the problem is too noisy .
that 's right . a few of the chinese dishes in the world have quite a large number of must be 8 to 4 .
that 's something that you really need to work on .
i use a copy machine .
i m not really interested in it .
they just did n't figure out how to set up the alarm .
i want to try on this pair .
the round shape pair ?
of course .
how long will it take ?
i agree how much ?
you just said 10 rounds .
sure but i do n't drink much . so i do n't know what to order .
so how about an aperitif ?
it sounds good . i 'd like to start with a compare .
stirred or shaken ?
stirred will be fine .
here you are .
thanks .
sure . all of our mixed drinks are excellent . you can also try a delicious nonalcoholic cocktail .
can you recommend one ?
try a singer . it has lime juice and grenadine over ice .
it sounds interesting . i 'll take it .
here we go .
it tastes great .
enjoy yourself .
yeah .
i 'd rather not . i 'll just have something cold .
i agree . i do n't like it in the supermarket . i like it except for the kitchen .
it 's a kind of rice ball that is made in malaysia . what about you ?
i think we need too .
how about some coffee and tea as well ?
are you kidding ? i want to start a italian word .
they are all right . i 'll just try them and make them as big as possible .
i think the coffee is a good idea .
so what 's the problem ?
me too . what 's on that channel ?
i 'd like to order a bottle of champagne lobster tail and filet mignon medium rare .
it could be that bad .
of course . you can have the money transferred here .
blah . . . what 's that ?
yes i will .
what do you mean by that ?
you 're welcome .
it 's really great .
so the food is the same .
that sounds nice . how much is it ?
i 'm very interested in the service centre . we offer a few different kinds of services .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
i want to find a book called gone with the wind . but i ca n't find it .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
she is a sensible man .
tell me how she looks .
what did you do ?
i 've never got all of that information before . tell me your name and phone number .
now i want you to look some pictures .
well i can t find out if you d like .
how much do you charge ?
and you 'd better not cry or you 'll have black streaks running down your face .
are you scared of anything ?
we can check them for you .
what ?
may i know what you do ?
so then why do n't you drive it ?
would you like to reserve a check ?
i don t like them . i want to get it fixed as soon as i can .
but we can have a try .
well . i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
you 're right . i just want to stay at home and watch a movie .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
why ?
let 's take a roundabout way .
that 's very kind of you . i 'd like to change the room .
yeah i know .
yes it 's definitely the same job as the world .
that 's true . when you 're ready to ask her out try and do the things they should know what they say .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
well i think i will take the fish .
no . that 's all .
it will be held on sunday evening . then just do it in a minute .
would you like to have a look at the menu ?
i 'm glad to hear that . maybe you 're right .
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's only about 10 minutes walk .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
i 've been in this company for two weeks . would you please tell me something about it ?
that s usual nowadays . i ll arrange some furniture for you .
the tape player doesn t work .
yeah it 's really unforgettable . thank you for making me happy all these years .
yeah some of my grappa will cure your shyness .
yes . i am applying for this interview and i want to know what i can do .
great . i ll take one .
we re going to have to do an investigation .
umm . i think i ll cut down on the bottom line . i can t stand it anymore !
is n't this li 's residence ?
see you later .
you are welcome . goodbye .
give me a break . it 's nothing serious .
because it does n't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
okay .
how did you feel about it ?
i will do that .
yes .
that 's good . i think i have done a good job .
they say my hair is too long my room is too dirty and i am not good enough at school .

you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
the ones that are on sale are from central america .
have you seen our waitress ?
you 're welcome .
sure .
what time would you like to take the test ?
how does it say ?
so you could directly check the weather before you want to move it .
your flight takes off at 8
i am sorry but there is no extra charge to check .
i 'm sorry to say that . thank you very much .
yes i would like to use it .
is there anything else i can do ?
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
i 've never had a mango .
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
i think so . it would be nice to know something about it .
well what about the sale price ?
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
can you eat the seed ?
no . peel the skin with a sharp knife and throw out the seed .
good luck . it 's my pleasure .
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
okay i 'll take a dozen .
what are you thinking ?

where do they grow mangoes ?
i can see that .
most of them in this store are from mexico .
well we just got in some mangoes .
mangoes . what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the nut ?
no you peel off the skin and throw out the nut .
how much are they ?
well the sale price is 1 each .
what does a mango taste like ?
they 're like a citrus fruit .
how do i know if it 's ripe ?
you can buy them hard . wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel .
where do they come from ?
most of them in this store are from mexico .
well we 've got some great mangoes on sale .

yes it 's very lightweight . but i do n't want this aluminum handle .

it is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway .
that is really convenient . especially now that fuel prices are so high ! what s under the hood ?
a very powerful 2 . 5 liter turbocharged engine trust me this car is fast !
now for the most difficult question . what is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?
very affordable sir . you can take it out of this lot today with 0 down payment and no interest for the first year ! you can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .
wonderful .

that 's for sure . i feel like i 'm melting .
would you like another beer ?
well the riverside mall has 200 stores in it including four major department stores .

i m afraid i ll be late .
i m not sure .

you have completely damaged my car .
well . . . i heard that they were playing the tv for next week .
we can t really do something like that !
well could you pick up some sugar ?
sorry but he 's busy then too .
nobody told me .
i 'll give you a ride .
that s too bad . i m afraid we can t .

maybe that s a good idea .
exactly .
are you a hurry ?
it 's ten after six .
we have a great variety of chinese antiques and porcelain . do you like it ?
i would say that .
how about this one ? it s very big of course .
that 's good .
what account would you like to deposit that ?
what do you think of the traffic ?

that 's very kind of you . we will have to do it next week .
i 'll do my best .
here 's twenty dollars .
it 's about 40 .
oh i see .
please fill in the form .
yes i do .
hello madam . where to ?
a oneway ticket to chicago please .
very good . thank you .
i 'm completely lost . i 'm looking for the concert .
3 dollars .
here 's your change .
it 's a private garden .
will you be able to take an umbrella ?
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
why are you calling me ?
thank you very much .
hi my sweetheart . it s dad .
yes of course . how about a brown one ?
thank you . and what s the number ?
yes i 'm afraid i 've got the wrong extension number .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
no problem .
see you then .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
12000 a year but you ca n't get visitors to live in .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i will call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the transportation is convenient .
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
then what 's the rent due date ?
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop . . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello tom !
wow you sound like a breath . have you been with all that ?
it was n't working out this morning . i got an important call to someone else and they should be happy to talk about it .
i 'm very tired .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
oh good ! it 's time for you to do your homework .
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
the same to you . welcome to our company .
thanks i 'll make sure and get to the airport .
do n't you hit it off ?
for almost two years .
i see .
she 's the boss i 've heard that the secret was terrific .
what is her strongest trait ?
no it 's not . but it 's a surprise .
he then would n't be so sure .
what happened ? did you find out ?
thank you .
hmm . i 'm afraid i can t make it . i have the time . i have to go .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
no you do n't ! the first time we have to check your car and we 'll return it to you .
what are you doing when i am done ?
yeah . we can make it . what are you doing ?
what 's the cause of gas ?
we can do that ! we can t use the stairs !
i know . last time i went to buy some things to mall . i did n't know .
yep ! it 's just one of those days .
well i m afraid you re not going to be my fault !
i m looking for a sweater .
what computer are you looking for ?
i ll take a look . i need a few silver cuff link and a pair of ties .
what s your camera ?
i think you 'll have the right . the certificate of the faster the faster the hardcover .
honey what do you need ?
thank you . it 's very kind of you .
that s great . and so what kind of exercise do you play ?
a nice blanket and it s also nice to meet you .
i m sorry . i don t think we should buy a set of camera .
any other ?
i can try . that doesn t help me much .
what 's the difference between the two ?
i 'm sorry . but i really ca n't stand it .
i wish it would be a better job .
get in .
thanks for saying so !
thank you for choosing bruno 's . we look forward to seeing you on the 2nd .
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no chicken breasts .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
no . that 's all .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
okay mr . sandals . your reservation is in our computer . all we need now is a phone number .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
we want to look at some of your products .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well . i have a good time !
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes .
no way ! i m serious !
it is a pity that i can t see it because i can t see it .
do n't be silly . i will tell you what i am doing . it will make me feel as soon as i can find the way .
great i ll come in later .
it is a little more expensive sir .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
what size do you wear ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
you re welcome . i ll need some small stamps for you .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's a big one in this room . it 's not the same as the city . you should be a stranger here .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s wonderful isn t it ?
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
oh here s an interesting ad for rent . how much is it ?
i have n't thought of that .
yes it 's very quiet and convenient .
and how s your birthday ?
the ad says 325 plus deposit .
that s way too much .
what account do you want to deposit ?
what are you going to do with it ?
let me see . that s no problem .
that will be fine .
would you please reconsider ?
thanks . i feel like celebrating . let s go have a beer . it s on me .
i m not sure but i really want to do something . i ll have to do it .
yes i do it a lot . but i do n't like doing dishes . what about you do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah i like the way the food is so delicious . i love it .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
are there any special brand ?
i 'll just have a try .
i am on the top floor . i would like to have a look at the invoice .
you ca n't be serious . how much do you want to pay ?
it s on sale for 80 . what do you think ?
hey i just want to do the washing up . it s too professional .
oh no . that s not my cup of tea . i think i ll take the pink suits . and the woolen sweater should be very good .
they 're nice . can i try them on ?
how would you like to pay ?
i would rather have a look at the girls in a different color .
thank you for reminding me . i think you ll be able to do more research in your living room .
i am going to miss you .
yeah speaking . how can i help you ?
do i need to pay any fees ?
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i m not sure .
i can help you with that . we are happy to hear it .
good . i will see you then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
there 's a lot to pick up in front of you .
yes . do you want to take any bags to check ?
should i bring anything with me ?
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
but the price has been reduced by 50 . it s a real bargain .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it is .
right ?
is it very expensive ?
with so few windows how can you even see what the problems are ?
do you have a balcony ?
yes it s very good .
the best part is the bedroom and the bathroom .
how about this one ? it 's selling the woods .
about 30 .
it is common practice to offer and then have a counteroffer .
in the kitchen ? how does it go ?
in the meantime you must be careful .
no problem .
it 's cool . let me see . i can put it on your bedroom .
wow ! this is so beautiful ! what a great opportunity !
i thought it might rain today .
thank you .
that s the color .
i am . how can i help you ?
hello i m calling to see if you are free this weekend . what can i do for you ?
oh . what day does the party start ?
yes i can think of it .
let 's see . have you been to a jazz club yet ?
no i m afraid not .
maybe i can help you in the future .
i see . ok . then the name of the company 's address . . .
we have very pleasant working conditions and i think you ll be a good manager for the job if you need to take the company to look through the internet .
should i bring anything with me ?
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
i 'm looking for a sharp dvd player .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about it on . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it only
well i seems to have everything done so quickly .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
oh i 'm sorry . i 'm going to go to the states .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
what kind of haircut do you want ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
i 'm sorry mr . bob . you can use that copy for me .
the cut please .
how about your hair ?
i 'm afraid it wo n't take too long .
what style do you want ?
i 'm afraid i 'm not for the right person for the blue dress . i 'm afraid i 'll buy a new jacket .
actually i think it 's a great idea to have a try . but i 'm afraid it would be difficult to learn more about the new job .
no you can cut quite a bit off i 'm sure you will like it . then i can examine it by myself .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yes i do .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
no . i just want to make sure my heart will love them .
i think you 're right . what 's the matter with them ?
oh they are really nice .
it 's a system like this .
oh thanks a lot . that 's really nice of you .
yes sir .
the <unk> is excellent . so what 's your favorite color ?
all right . i 'll make it up to you .
let 's see .
oh nice . what are you looking for ?
what happened ?
where is the place ?
i will go check out the kitchen next .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
it is worth it .
yes you did . we do have a lot of things with you .
yes . i do n't think i 'm going to be able to get in with them .
where is it ?
how long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?
sure . the first place you need to check out .
it s very interesting . is it a good idea to get food ?
it sure is .
did you get the message ?
because it does n't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
where is it located ?
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
actually i am not the only one who can find spicy and when we 're abroad i think it 's better to try to get more lavish .
sure . do you want to be in a movie or something ?
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
what kind of food do you usually have ?
i prefer sea food .
do you know why ?
i think i 'd like to buy some meat .
well it looks very nice .
i like spaghetti . do you like spaghetti ?
ok sir . i would like some rice and pepper . we have many kinds of noodles in japan korea . in fact it 's very easy to bring in a passport with us . we have this month <unk> in china .
not yet . i am really in art mood for some chinese food .
do you like some soup ?
thank you for your advice .
well what do you have in mind ?
you are a good cook .
hmm . . . that 's really delicious . i think i 'll try it .
all right here are the information . shall we go to the bar first ?
oh yeah . there are many things i need to do . i 'm sure you 'll love it .
what are the machines ?
i guess i asked him to do that . i guess we should get some money too .
no . you can only get a few more if you need them .
alright . and what is your name ?
you 're welcome .
actually it 's a little green carpet .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
the best i can do is 120 per pair .
we should be able to give you an order of the house .
thanks . how many bedrooms do you need ?
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
oh really ? well i guess i ll have to start looking at the shop .
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
but i want to get a pair of expensive shoes .
actually i do n't think i can afford that .
it 's a great step up from the local market . let 's see . . .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
that 's strange . i was always in the mood to get the price down to the bookstore when i came to the bookstore .
yes . her company is a <unk> man with a hammer and a focus of products .
do you have any ideas ?
you 'll have to pay 25 every time you overdraft .
how much do you think they 're dieting ?
i can get a few of them right away but might have to order some .
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
do you have any questions ?
i lost it .
is it a color tv or a black and white tv ?
i want to return this cellphone .
go and try it on .
okay . i 'll just buy the shirt .

is it possible for me to buy them now ?
well i ll have to get a pair of trousers . would you like to have them in a size ?

that 's it ! that 's the one i brought for you ! maybe i 'll just ask you to other message !

that s not good . you should always make some preparations .
fortunately things are so easy .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like . classical music might make you clever but dance might make you livelier and happier .
lots of things . i can use them .

i think i can find something from the menu .
yeah why not . do you want to start shopping at the new food ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !

well we have classes and some medications that might help . i 'll give you a hand .
i am not sure .
did you make any effort ?
you 're right . i could n't agree with you .
what 's the cost ?
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials ignite it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .
yes the ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth and they have developed into a festival filled with food performances and games now .
well i 'm here today and we are having a big wedding this weekend .
here 's your number .
not good . i lost my wallet .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
what can i do for you today ?
i have n't taken a long time .
o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room sir ?
not much .
you have your own vehicle ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
do you want one ?
it 's a good idea .
yes but do n't forget that the stop is guilty .
first we will go to the city centre and stop for something to drink . then we will visit the university museum .
is it close to the subway station ?
you are right . we will be more careful .
you can always make a sandwich .
sure but it 's a good car .
you do n't know ?
i got it from ikea .
i ca n't believe it . i am not really sure .
yes i mean it .
i am glad we 've come .
i 'm okay .
hi peter . how are you ?
oh lots of things . mostly just the weather the weather report on the internet .
that sounds interesting . can you go to the cinema ?
yes i do .
how could it be ?
yes .
you like the food there ?
no not really .
well i was thinking that we could discuss with each other .
sorry . i can t do it .
it is a good idea . what can i do for you ?
ok . can i get it from you ?
it 's to me . i 'm working on this company .
my boss is worried about that . he will never be back so i can attend the meeting with you .
oh good idea . you know there is a new bar nearby .
really ? what happened ?
you just need to take them home .
all right i will explain it to you . now scram .
but you know how to say when i am about the book .
i know i 'm going to have to get the ticket .
oh well . thanks .
i m afraid not . don t you know the address ?
there are several things . i like almost all kind of programs .
i see . how many kinds of packing do you have ?
i see . how do i get that ?
what can i help you with ?
i 'm in pretty bad shape dr . ford .
i am sorry . we will cancel your bill .
i think i caught a cold .
don t worry about it . it s just a lot of money .
it s an absolute outrage sarah the us government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers money to the auto industry . these are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt .
i think he might stay in the hospital for that .
i think i want to try a new style .
but you should make up your mind first .
i have been studying english since primary school .
i know what you mean . i thought it was . . .
no i have n't . i 'm really in a hurry .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
the next class will be fine .
i like chinese .
what 's your favorite flower ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
well it s my honor to be here for you .
what 's the matter
the food station was as crowded as usual . i waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich and when i finally got it the chicken was underdone .
how 's the only difference ?
i bought one size up by mistake .
well i think you 're making a good progress .
can i help you ?
fine . how are you doing this morning ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
i 'm an english major . i 'm taking english class at the university of michigan .
i 'm sure you do n't know what to do .
all right . we have a single room available for you .
i know .
see you .
what would you like to say to me ?
well . i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
i 'm very good at english even when i talk to you i 'll be doing well in english .
because it does n't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
i have been doing the piano for a while . i just hope the test will be good .
absolutely .
i think so . i think you are awesome .
hey i am sorry for that .
i am worried about the meeting this morning .
there are many universities for you to choose from . some famous universities such as harvard yale the university of michigan and massachusetts institute of technology are really wonderful places to study but they are very competitive and expensive . some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper .
i see .
because it does n't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
ok i can use a credit card for several days .
stuff like that but i think the lion dance is a bit too difficult and dangerous .
i really want to change the job . i feel a little bit nervous .
yeah we can take the subway . it 'll be cheaper and cheap .
great ! i will apply for this position when i travel abroad .
sure . here 's a nice one for you .
that must be very interesting . they must have a lot of fun .
i know .
i 'll go and speak to bob .
you re going to take courses ?
yes i m going to take some university courses there .
what are you going to major in ?
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
i think i 'll buy one too .
i 'm just doing a lot of work . i think i 'll make a good impression on my own .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
it 's on the third floor .
that sounds pretty good . i ll put in a credit card and pay off ?
you can check out two books at a time .
got it . thank you so much .
for two weeks . after that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer .
ok . thank you very much .
yes of course . i will go to the library .
and what about april ?
you 're welcome .
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
my name is sam .
nice to meet you too .
yes it 's my first visit . you must be here a lot of people in america .
can i help you ?
may i ask you for your ticket ?
hmm . . . i think i ve got the same idea as this bus .
is n't your family like this place ?
why ?
i am going to visit my sister . she said she was going to get better .
he does n't live in an article about that . it 's a great pity if i have thirteen people or two kids .
and it 's a very cool game .
really ? i mean they are always saying that boys and girls go to school all night .
thank you for your company . i 'd like to go for the great opportunity .
the pleasure is mine . it 's really hard to find a place to read .
i was in the bank at the time .
okay . what 's the problem ?
i would like to take a driver 's course .
can i leave a message for you ?
in the united states it is very difficult .
you 're a modest student . i 'm sure you can do well in the future .
i 'm going to need a driver 's course .
what kind of things would you like ?
well in that case i guess i am not fit for this position .
yeah i remember . but you know our neighbor ?
well what did you do ?
not always . but i think he 's a very good husband .
it 's ok . you think he was better with the boss ?
you are free . you can go to dinner .
do you have any other questions ?
i suppose i 'm a very good student . i got a good score of her ability to deal with her .
you speak really well .
yes . that 's why i do n't like it . all right ?
i 'll just cancel your question and you 'll need to give me one of his progress .
of course . i got a parttime job as a bartender .
is n't it a bit ? it 's not as bad as you think .
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
did you guys go on a date already ?
what happened ?
i 've noticed you 've been working overtime a lot .
i do n't know .
well i got to know this ticket . if i have n't received all the files i am taking almost a few classes in college . i also have a lot of credits this time .
is n't it a bit too bad . you only want a little silly .
did you guys go on a date already ?
it was n't as high as i would have liked . it was 2 . 5 .
it 's really a shame .
i do n't know . i just went to the library and forgot to talk to my family .
did you guys go on a date already ?
i think i caught a cold .
what was the score ?
never mind the first time you have .
hi .
who s the matter ?
i went to australia and new zealand .
i got a <unk> . i learned a lot from that experience in my previous job .
i see .
yes .
in that case i won t hold you up . what was the fare to your ticket ?
i 'm dead tired .
why ?
because you have to hear it really loud to get the full concert effect .
what about all these other letters ?
yeah ! i ca n't believe it . she is always good to know .
i have no idea . maybe i can help you with what you have done .
we 're going to buy the same as paying for a monthly basis .
no i just stay home late . i 'll be late .
i know . but i am a fast learner and i 'm willing to do the same thing .
i think so .
i do n't think i will try to get arrested by this .
no but i did n't know how to use them .
are you kidding me ? it is a great one .
i 'm going to need to take a driver 's course .
do you have your book list ?
we 'll have to try it . but the finish will be soon .
ok i will be there around 6 .
yes he 's got engaged .
i think this is the only way to learn english . all you have to do is to move on .
do n't mention it .
no .
sometime . i was told by the end of this month .
i think that is a very good idea . it also has more authority that there are plenty of articles from correspondents all over the world and the other is very important .
what 's that ?
i asked him whether i was injured or not .
maybe you are right . but if you are going to have to class like this .
interesting ! and no doubt about that .
i have been studying .
do you have a plan to come in ?
i need it . thank you .
i 'll go and speak to bob .
you re going to take courses ?
yes i m going to take some university courses there .
what are you going to major in ?

i want to find a book called gone with the wind . but i ca n't find it .

it 's got a copy of the latest issue .
we are willing to work with you but do n't think it would be a problem for us .
i m afraid you can t . it s for the correct time .
i had no idea that the morning air was n't even appear at night .
well i am sorry you have to leave so early .
yeah .
really ? tell me about it . i have n't gone to the club for a long time .
mmmm . . . how about the new project coming up ?
yeah .
i 'm sure you 're trying to have them . do n't you think we 're hadn t found a fish yet ?
it 's a good thing . the first thing is why do n't you just ask the boss to give you a little ring .
really ? i heard it was supposed to be great .
i see . . . well what do you have in mind ?
yes . i 've decided to travel to four years in europe .
next week i 'll be on the list of all the things i need to get .

how about the price of the sites ?
i 've really appreciate it !
to be honest i have no idea .
what else is that ?
ok . first let 's take a look at the review .
sure . first of all it 's easy . first of all you have to explain everything to me . the more thing is to explain everything to the ancient olympics .
it does n't matter ! i just want to couple more money !
of course . but i think the rose will be the best color as the first color and style are of the year .
why ? you mean getting a lot to decide if you want to travel to find a course ?
you will be a very promising one .
then i might want to have one .
i m fine celia . and you ?
i m ok . i m so busy !
do you have a lot of homework ?
yes . don t you ?
of course i do !

do you want to go to an empty classroom ?
that sounds good .
good just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class . good luck !
oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
what do you mean ?
oh you are kidding . that 's the sort of little <unk> .
yes . there is a big one in the living room .
oh i 'm shocked .
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i am worried .
what about ?
i m not too clear on some things about my lease .
oh is that all ?
i feel very nervous about it .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i suppose i will stay in the future .
i understand . i think you re right but i m sure you ll find a way to get more degree .
do you have any experience in this field ?
that 's normal . i remember a lot of people who were able to grow accustomed to the experience . while i was accepted i had to work with them . i was able to overcome my boss and i was able to overcome most of the effort . my boss was able to get a project and eventually .
what ? what is it ?
i understand . but i think it s time to stop .
what ? what do you mean ?
so what am i supposed to do ?
i think you re right . i think that s true for me .
just basic principles your experience and experience and then what would you say to your life ?
great .
what can i do for you today ?
i would like to return this book .
what do you need ?
i need to know if i have any fees to pay .
did you check the periodicals ?
i didn t even bother to think of that .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
i believe they are a local delicacy in the south .
i know you are .
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
this is the same size . two of the old ones are the same .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
you know why ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other countries in other countries .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to use the copy machine .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
all right . now you can take your case away .
how much is the fee ?
yes i often feel like a million dollars after work like i can take on anything .
you re going to have to wait for a while .
i want to transfer 200 .
i won t be able to pay any fees .
i feel better now .
i will pay it if i have n't got enough for it .
could you show me your id please ?
i would like to use a computer .
do you know how to drive ?
my roommate always brings a lot of friends from <unk> .
what class ?
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients <unk> very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively .
i 'll see what i have . what do you want me to do ?
yes i do .
can you tell me the classes you want to work ?
wise decision . that is 400 yuan . you 'll find it 's totally worth it .
i 'll be free from two until monday or tuesday .
i 'm not sure yet . i 'm having a meeting with some friends .
many people are urgent by themselves . when will they be convenient ?
i think we are all out of house .
you do n't know ?
yeah me too . the big water is ready and the ring is heavy .
good luck .
it is .
ok . bye !
yes i 'll be glad to be able to make it .
well i 've been very busy . maybe you can go for a walk with the wind .
what is it ?
my mattress was supposed to be delivered today .
give me the <unk> cold .
what 's the problem ?
no i 'm not . i really need to check this off .
yes i do .

oh thanks .
yes it is . please wait a moment . i 'll check it .
i want a check .
certainly sir . well if you 'll just bring it in a moment i can process you with that .
ok shall i make a coffee first ?
follow me . make sure not to interrupt them .
no . i 'm not sure .
let me tell you what 's wrong with your computer .
how fast is it ?
here you are . thanks for your help .
i think it 's enough for you to change the room . we do n't have any smaller ones .
i think i 'm going to go and get myself to the concert by evening . would you like to come with me ?
i think you 're right .
i would rather say no .
no problem . there s something wrong .
can you make it up ?
i 'm happy to hear that . what time are you going to leave ?
i 'm not sure . i know what to do .
ok . try this one .
sure company rules are not very strict at this point .
which band do you like best ?
i do n't think so . the changing trees is very complicated for us to cut in their seats . the only thing is that the seats are usually made of these three .
i like it . naturally it can arouse your feelings .
that 's true . when did you start work ?
i don t think i m afraid i m going to be late .
could you tell me how to get there ?
no i am not sure . i will be the english teacher and i can take a class as well .
okay what can i get you ?
no i 'm afraid i ca n't .
they 're due to the tv now .
yes . we would expect the goods to be held in two months .
ok .
i 'll tell we discuss it with our manager .
do you have anything else i can have instead ?
everyone in our class had a birthday party for me . i think i need to get some exercise to know .
in fact there are a lot of storybooks upstairs in our country .
my moblogging is a combination of the word mobile and blogging . it 's another form of blogging . users can publish blog entries to the web from a mobile devices .
i still think nobody plays for nothing .
it 's a quarter to 12 . i think it 's time to drive .
got it . i 'll start by now .
how about a china vase ?
that would be great . thanks for your help .
if we start early i will be fined .
i manage english .
you 're going to do my homework . no more today i have to finish writing this report . do n't forget to take a seat .
no .
i see thank you .
i think the main reason is that there is a lot of opportunity to motivate people who are good and to work with . if i take up a new one he doesn t like it or ten days faster and lead to a team .
so it 's good for me to do things next week . i 'll be there on time .
could you please get me the pepper from the cupboard ?
that should n't be a problem . thanks for calling .
first put your money in the slot at the turnstile and then push the turnstile to get into the platform .
uh . . . yeah . .
i want to become the tour guide .
have you taken your temperature ?
hmm . . . i 'll take it .
do n't worry . you 'll be fine . first of all put on your hands .
i think there 's too much easy . i have learned english and it helps me to deal with those who are honest . they are always more professional .
for what ?
do n't worry i can manage it by myself . i do n't know how to use my atm card .
you can always transfer money from that account into your new one .
i have a problem .

was i ? i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
you did n't realize that i needed to pay you for the first time .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
his parents must feel very happy .
i do n't think she will do such a thing .
i agree . i think that we should give him a good cashier .
maybe you are right .
but i like its color .
anyway it 's my ideal coat . i 'll take it .
i 'll take one too .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to my liking too .
say how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
i have n't even told you what it is yet !
it 's said that the ancient olympics is the symbol of the royal family .
really ? what about him ?
what time do you open and get ready ?
i m not sure . i guess i m a good singer but after having a hard time finding a job .
wow that s really interesting . and i m going to have a try at the magazine .
yes it is .
have you been there ?
have you finished your appointment ?
so what s the problem ?
sir this is the new bar . i have never had one before .
yeah falling in love is another good shape .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
it s a good idea . but i want to know if you will be a girl like her .
it must be really hard to find a strong team . are you sure to love the ball ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
really ? i thought he was playing football .
what 's wrong ?
sounds like he was pretty serious about this .
he took the picture when i was only looking for it .
you mean we have a few menu for the six o 'clock ?
what do you mean ?
yes i 'm jane . you 're mr . stevenson right ?
you missed a court appearance .
and when did you get your passport ?
on the fourth floor .
it 's all right . there is no other questions .
why do n't you talk to me ?
really ?
it looks like it was made just for you .
your dream will love it .
what does the actual price include ?
i 'm still not sure whether i can recover from the internet .
can you tell her how she is going to react ?
i think i know who you 're talking about .
think about it .
i think my mom is the most worried .
i hope that he brings change to america .
i can t afford about the city .
how about going for a walk ?
she 's the one who saved the life of my life insurance policy .
i 'm linda the manager .
she 's a bit nervous i do n't know .
must be very careful about the traffic jam .
i like she 's very nice .
well i 'm not going to tell you .
i feel sorry for her .
why do you say that ?
no i did for her .
it 's for a job . it looks perfect for you .
no just a moment . i 'm afraid he 's in a meeting at the moment .
fine . maybe i can get a cup of coffee .
i hope not .
oh i get it . but we 'd better not have to worry about this .
what 's it like ?
if you were choosing a person for your health what would you do ?
haha ! she 's wearing my pants you know . can she call me now ?
and what 's wrong with them ?
oh no ! i 'm sorry to hear that . but this is my first time to leave .
ok . take care . how would you like to pay ?
of course i did . i 'm sorry .
no i do n't think so . my boss would like to have some questions about my schedule .
i do n't know . they are really crazy .
yes it 's right .
cool ! we have a great variety of new ties for example . what 's the price ?
that 's not bad . what did you do there ?
i know but that 's my bad . i need to get to the hospital .
are you sure he is the right person for the girl ?
not everything but as helpful as i know that he 's almost sixty .
you can see the results . they just did n't know how to goes .
that 's only a little bit of a boss .
no i do n't want to hear about something like that . would you like to call me again ?
oh come on . i just gave them my phone number . and i 'll get it for you right away .
i 'm so sorry taylor . go talk to her . i 'm sure she 'd be happy to see you .
this is bob . he 's the boss of the company .
well we have to make sure that the person issued the ticket is the ticket and the number is the gas .
yes . my car was n't working .
i 'm so sorry about that . i was so concerned . you 've been so helpful .
i 'm so sorry taylor . go talk to her . i 'm sure she 'd be happy to see you .
but we just drove across town . ca n't we ?
yes very much .
wow ! i ca n't believe it . how many kids will be there ?
i ca n't agree more . what are they ?
that 's great . i 'll have to get back to you tomorrow .
you are always so hospitable .

yes it 's going to be a little different .
what did you bring ?
what was the . . ? ? hey they 've closed the ticket window !
you re right .
i will ! i could use my beach towel !
that 's what i want to do .
i didn t get accepted .
i see . that 's a long time to get a salary raise . not so much time i have to pay .
yeah . the price has become more expensive .
that 's really cool . can you read it ?
i 'm a guide . i take people on tours to countries in south america like peru .
well i think i should be more careful next time .
yeah i 'm ok .
no thank you . i 'll have to meet my friend at the airport .
do you want any milk ?
yes but let me get a burger and some chips .
hello . do you have any questions ?
good morning .
i will listen to your advice and your advice .
you are welcome .
i see . yes that is a very good one of my problems .

really ? i m surprised .
no . i m serious . i m going to quit my job .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well . how do you know ?
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree .
i am sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
it 's still early .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 pm this thursday afternoon . please come on time .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
because it does n't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
i don t know .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great ! i think we can make it if we 're lucky that we must go .
good . let 's go now .
and about time too .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
ok i will but let 's go to a disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
i hope it won t be too long .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
is 's <unk> ! i have to be in rome by five .
what 's the hurry ?
well it was my first night in the cold wind .
oh yes ?
sure . what 's up ?
i would like to cancel one of my accounts .
oh we always pay you a room .
i have a headache . these past few days i 've been living off painkillers . man i feel like my head is going to explode .
i 'm sorry to hear that . it was really a good friend .
no that 's enough .
how about your steak ?
it 's not the right material . or the right color . i ca n't possibly accept it .
well . do you have any in mind ?
well it all sounds nice .
thank you sir .
ok . i 'll take one .
here you are .
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
congratulations !
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
well it s made of pure gold .
yes i do .
thank you . what s your occupation mr . smith ?
not too lavish .
just a moment . . let me find out . our manager wil be here in a minute . so will you speak to him ?
oh this one is perfect .
then my son drove into a tree .
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
actually i 'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
no problem .
i m worried . i know i m going to be late for this .
thank you . i really appreciate your help .
do i have to pay to use the stations ?
oh i see . but that s ok .
do you want to go see a movie ?
oh what i was thinking of taking you from a really good friend .
well i guess you re the reason for coming . i hope to see you soon .
it is something that you really need to do .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
nothing . . . i just want to have a rest .
i was too excited to sleep .
great . everyone has always been able to do something like that . it s always more than the weekend .
are these in the mood after the class ?
you know that i care for you . i hope you 'll recover soon .
can you be a little more specific ?
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
be careful ! do you have any time to go ?
really ? what will i do if i can t get the chance ?
oh here comes the bus . what 's the fare ?
that will be the best way to get there .
uh i think you 're right . everything will be fine . here is your change .
i 'll pick you up at about 2 o 'clock .
so what are you gonna do ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
it 's pretty . how much is it ?
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
i think this is the coolest watch i 've ever owned .
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
what s the weather report ?
huh ?
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and forget and forget and forget and forget and forget and forget and forget about what it s about !
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i m just looking at this map of the world . i m preparing for a geography class .
you did ?
thanks for saying so but i am really tired .
what do you think that i should get ?
anyway i think i need a nose and some breast implants as well .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
i 'm not <unk> anymore . but i 'm really tired of all this sort of job . what about this time ?
yeah .
i know but i m still not the guilty party anyway .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'm going to try to find out where the school is located .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
my mattress was supposed to be delivered today .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know but i find these sorts of things hard to say . they wo n't like it if i tell them to turn off the tv . now i just hope the show will end soon .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you think that the most important thing is you can t live in a city like that ?
i have n't seen you for ages .
well . i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
i was thinking of it when i was little child .
i knew . when did you become a senior high <unk> ?
i thought it was easy . anyway you have to pay for it .
i think i 'm your lucky fellow .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
thanks for coming .
when are you off ?
i 'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth .
i 'll pick you up at about 8 00 .
goodbye . hope to see you again next year .
nothing much . what 's new with you ?
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
what if i stay up and do something until i get tired ?
okay . check you later .
i think i caught a cold .
a vegan . i do n't eat or use any animal based products . i do n't wear leather eat eggs drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . i used to be a <unk> before which basically means you do n't eat meat but still have fish and seafood .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?
fine thanks . i 've been busy lately .

i 'm going to try to find out where the school is located .
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
goodbye . see you again sometime .
i 'm on my way out to a new year 's banquet . how do i look ? is my makeup ok ?
it 's the japanese team . it seems we have never been to the field of mountains .
can you believe that last year 's eve ?
well you can bet this relationship is going to be a flash in the pan .
it must have been love at first sight because i know he 's a nice guy .
oh i think you are right . well it can be a shame that we will have to work on this .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it s just one of those things .
you do ?
i ran into it a couple of weeks ago . what do you know ? name 's hal .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
can you tell me something about it ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i 'm getting sleepy .
no i do n't think i 'm fat .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what would you like to have ?
yes .
good idea .
it s another b .
i think so . let 's go .
that 's what i thought .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
do you really want to do that ?
i took a shine to him when we were together . but it s really beautiful .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
no . i want to finish my degree in economics .
of course not !
i 'll tell you what .
do you know the day they plan to open ?
how much is it ?
by the way do you think it 's a good idea to give free gifts to attract customers ?
thanks . now that i think i have a chance to take it easy .
i am .
well . i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
yeah .
i don t think so . it s probably an idea of having the future .
good luck !
what 's wrong with it ?
what do you mean janice ?
i have a run .
if i were you i 'd be happy to help . you look great .
of course i will .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . . .

yes i did . i went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
i ca n't accept your excuse . it 's five o 'clock .
i 'm sorry . i do n't know .
i think i 'll find that they 're playing games .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily .
he 's got a promotion .
well when can he come over ?
it 's true . he is a hard worker .
i think pink s great .
what about this pink ?
the ones that are predipped in them or dislike them !
i do n't know . they think that they would be after they have cut out pictures .
i 'd like to .
i think he might like to be a good mother .
sorry . give me a break .
oh no . what 's the matter ?
i ve already voted .
i like spring .

i think you should do some jogging . it 's good for you .
well my boyfriend is n't it ?
i all set .
we pitched a tent in the night waiting for the sunrise . wow ! it was too beautiful .
that s right . the national anthem is o canada and the united states are sold well as the world .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
yes i did n't know . there were some dangerous seats in the park .
yes .
well i guess i should have a try .
yes i mean it .
well . . . and if there 's a lot of things they would like to get better .
oh i will .
oh ! i just remembered i 've got to stay in a different world .
oh we had a cut on the wedding . we 're not really in the same boat !
actually he had a mask over his face .
you 're welcome !
that sounds right .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
yes . it 's an english teacher .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
well it 's not as bad as that . i know it 's a secret .
i would love to see an old book !
oh you can take the subway .
it was written by howard sounds .
i do n't know what to do . you can have it done in the next couple of days .
how much does it cost ?
some of my friends say that his wife is a very good person . her name is nokia .
she 's pretty easy to get along with . she listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .
what about the kitchen ?
that 's right . i know he will really enjoy the paintings and the sunshine . are you sure he can do a lot of homework ?
really ? what kind of drugs did he ask you ?
that 's ok . so i 'll make the decision and get the next fair .
huh ?
huh ?
i want to have a picnic with my friends mum .
nothing . just make sure you 're back .
i 'd like to . thank you !
yes i 'll be glad to help you .
she is absolutely wonderful .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
what 's your favorite flower ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
yeah that 's probably what she said .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
you do n't know ?
i 'm sorry . i 've never watched it .
yes i have . they have the best friend who wants to be a better person .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
i think there 's a massive action movie . it has become a headache about the only 1 or more .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
it 's very nice of you . i feel uncomfortable when i 'm in america .
you really should n't take any photos .
first of all the things you need to do is make sure that you buy the clothes .
i never knew that .
i feel run down tired .
what happens if the goods are cheaper ?
the meter is <unk> but it is not included in the shipping costs .
i m not sure .
really ? i want to go too .
i think the pink one is the best . i 'll take it .
it s a <unk> game .
no i will e the reason why i am going to paint it .
you want to know what the <unk> of these ads are <unk> .
that 's right ! i guess i can t wait to see it anymore .
i do n't think so . the air is so fresh .
however i think the results are better .
i think so . it s very hot here .
no but i think it 's still unacceptable .
ok thank you .
i am not serious about it .
that 's not true . he is a weird guy talking about him and no one knew his new boss .
yeah i 'm going to have to take care of some business .
yeah i know . so what are you talking about ?
no wonder people say it .
have you read it ?
i think that 's the reason i 'm very shy .
a new car ?
she 's the teacher 's pet that has a large selection of art .
i 'm not sure . i just got one .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
can you tell which team seems to win ?
they 're still fighting hard . let 's wait and see .
that 's right .
hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?
hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
what 's your name ?
ping . ping .
what do you do ?
i 'm from new york . what about you ?
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i doubt if i were the only one day before i was the best .
a growing keepfit fever is sweeping over china .
yes i know it was but i never did .
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
he 's diving for the gold .
i was just watching tv .
nothing much . i 'm just taking a walk .
i do n't know what he wants to take .
oh no !
yes . he 's also a private eye about him .
what number is he looking for ?
alright . that 's a good idea . i will try it on .
fine . maybe i should invite him along too .
see you later .
neither . the game ended in two all .
what is the date of your present job ?
china beat brazil 3 to 0 .
there is no reason why . he didn t say that .
do you know what the title of the company is ?
take care of yourself .
exactly . you 're going to wear one to a new one right ?
yeah . but his wife had an important trip to canada and she asked me to go to her wedding and we did n't have much time to date .
he 's not young as he looks . i think he 's almost sixty .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .

yes i always cry at <unk> .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .

i 'm sorry to have bothered you .
it 's ok . i 'll be happy to make you some tonight .
i would like to have the famous dinner with the <unk> chef s salad and real pie .
well it 's only three stops from here .
we need to think about it .
okay . thank you for your interview .
thanks . that would be very nice .
i 'd like to hire a bike .
how about having dinner with me ?
i am sorry sir . we have no more than ten years ago .
oh i did n't really like it . it was too hot .
i understand . but we still haven t found any of the other films .
yes . and i could n't communicate with the american idol that night !
but they are too expensive .
hello tom !
wow you sound like a breath . have you been with all that ?
it was n't working out this morning . i got an important call to someone else and they should be happy to talk about it .
i 'm very tired .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
oh good ! it 's time for you to do your homework .
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
the same to you . welcome to our company .
thanks i 'll make sure and get to the airport .
do n't you hit it off ?
for almost two years .
i see .
she 's the boss i 've heard that the secret was terrific .
what is her strongest trait ?
no it 's not . but it 's a surprise .
he then would n't be so sure .
what happened ? did you find out ?
thank you .
hmm . i 'm afraid i can t make it . i have the time . i have to go .
i 'm a big fan of disco .
i 'm a great idea . i 'm a really excited person .
what ?
i like to play computer games and other things .
yes . i m pretty good at making curries now . i m pretty sure they will be able to find the ideal market at least .
great ! i just got back from the movies and it 's over .
i was n't able to make it . i was an italian student and i think we had a good time .
by the way can you tell me what the date it is today and what day it is please ?
sure . it is also called summer jasmine which is the symbol of the royal family .
oh we had a birthday party for david last night . as a matter of fact i woke up with a terrible hangover this morning .
i think that we have .
not bad but i 'm sure .
yes i was .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yeah he came back from a fever .
he 's got a promotion .
really ? what happened ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
did n't you ever talk to him about it ?
well this is just between ourselves of course but he was her lover and he wanted to leave her so she got revenge . i heard him say she was a dangerous woman .
it must be strange for you to live in taiwan .
it is the right time for you to come back .
sorry . we ca n't .
he never came .
then what did he say when you left ?
what 's the matter ?
what 's more it is n't . oh yes !
he tried to leave with the money .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
how did he make a fortune ?
yes . do you know what we need to do ?
well i 'll just use your computer and i can listen to the radio .
great . i 'd love to .
you can say that . they will come to the excellent performance of china .
yes it 's very serious and the spirit is very popular .
that 's good enough . i 'll go with it . thanks for your help .
excellent . i 'll teach you how to use them .
to tell you the truth it was completely accidental .
i can ask the boss to give you a call .
i sure did .
yes we got a few pictures of the men from the skin .
have you fallen in love ?
yes i have a lot of her .
i had a few coffees while i was in the movie .
i think that we have had a litter too much of the punch .
i told him that i hadn t got a raise for three years . i also told him that one of my coworkers quitted her job and could not have it so much at the end .
it is my pleasure . now let me have a good time here .
you 're welcome .
you really have to go to class .
will you ever get my camera ?
that 's very kind of you to say so . . but . .
well i wish i could . you are the best tutor i 've ever had .
yes why not ?
ok see you then .
see you !
is there a difference ?
what about the teachers ?
and it 's so much fun to watch .
and it 's amazing . i 'll buy some and you can make it as interesting as you like .
i do n't know . i 'm a student here . i thought maybe it was given me a complete background of it .
it 's great ! how much is it ?
as a matter of fact i want to spend my time here in the future .
that 's terrific .
because i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
that 's wonderful . i ca n't wait .
the stone is a <unk> log . it was turned to stone millions of years ago .
yes . take myself for example . i seldom go to cinemas but it does n't mean i no longer see films instead i see films at homewatching ccds .
it 's just around the corner .
and which direction were you going ?
the party starts at 8
that sounds fine . we will be taking the next train .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i have to be back on sunday . can i take you down a little while ?
could you drop me off at the airport ?
wow ! what a pity !
ok . i feel like things are done .
good . now here 's your key sir . if you need anything just dial 0 .
a minute please .
i like this style . it 's very nice and it 's very smart .
well it 's very nice of you .
is it a chinese world ?
let 's see . it 's interesting .
and the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ?
do you think you can teach me some ?
do you eat a lot of money ?
that s your brother .
well cool !
really ?
it 's a time question . it 's important to me . my father is very happy and he 's so happy to have a good time .
it s alex . . . have i got the correct news .
what a pity !
it 's a very good thing that you like .
ok . how many kinds of music do you want ?
the olympic games was a great game . i mean can you tell me how to do it ?
it 's a program about a person who is good football match .
i wonder it might have been an easy question .
yes good gracious . that s incredible !
wow ! what else does it do ?
yes . with the 600 second digital memory l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
wow . . . that must have been a long time .
you need to use the computer .
early next month .
well i 'll try to go a formal dinner and take a look at the celebrate it !
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
yes we are very lucky . i 'm sure you will .
well he 's going to be by the nose .
oh thank you . i am very excited .
well . the state will benefit a lot i suppose .
10 .
is there a bathroom ?
no . i am not sure about that .
you can go to the bank of credit and they can pay you there .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
oh how bad is it ?
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
you are so lucky . anyway the show is breathtaking . i have some difficulty in getting old .
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
well i 've heard a lot about it .
have you got any plans for the party ?
thanks . i appreciate it .
the next game i will definitely be there .
that s what i thought . what do you think ?
your room number is 707 . here is your key . the bellhop will help you carry the suitcases to your room . have a nice evening !
because it does n't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
i m glad i finally meet the family .
yes we have a lot of friends . i love you .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
you are welcome . i 've also been looking forward to cleaning the old toaster . . .
yes i think that might work for me as well .
ok .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .
oh i understand . what time does the flight get to rome ?
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
i only want to get one .
yes i did . i thought the flight was bad .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
no mary went first last time .
no . do you ?
really ? how did it go ?
yeah . i signed up for it online .
have you had any other symptoms ?
yeah it was nice to meet you .
please be careful tom .
a double room without a view for 15 people is that right ?
great . i 'll give you a call tonight .
no . it 's all yours .
well . i was wondering what you see . .
i 'm not sure .
please are n't you too mr . smith ?
i love rumba and waltz .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i 'm the only one who plays the piano in the world .
because i 'm on a date !
yeah a dancing queen . wanna go and join them ?
do n't be so modest . i know you 're ready .
sounds really interesting .
not really . the ancient chinese think are a great ancient chinese . it was considered as the chinese language as the world .
is that the place that is popular ?
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west the purpose is generally quite <unk> savor the wine .
that 's great !
they 're from schnitt 's of rudesheim germany . would you like us to check them ?
i 'm so much more experienced than the chinese guys are covered by the company .
it 's very cold .
sure . i get a lot of information and make many friends .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . th
good idea . i like the idea of coming .
ok .
oh ! thank you !
do n't you often dance ?
yes i have a lot of work .
thanks a lot .
you 're a good dancer .
ok . let 's have a drink .
it 's very nice . but i like it very much .
what 's your favorite dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
thanks you . shall we stand a bit further ? i would like to take the tower in .
yes i do . it 's a very romantic .
some of them are summer clothes . and they can have them bought from the menu .
i think so . the security door is so firm that nobody can see behind his chair .
i didn t get accepted .
well .
yes do you like it ?
come on . a little labor much health . and i know you are doing a lot of stress .
you 're a good dancer .
sounds like a good idea .
yeah i heard it has a very good voice .
it 's very nice .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
fine .
swimming . what about you ?
like what ?
yes .
oh i see . then i 'll follow a lot of times . how about a racket ?
i think the biggest issue of greatest concern is the old people can relax .
what kind of power struggles are you talking about ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but it can be fairly warm in summer . it 's a wet country so it 's nice in winter .
do you have concert halls in your city ?
that s a good idea . how much is it ?
let 's eat at the restaurant across the street from my apartment .
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring .
may i ask you some questions ?
it s the same in the city . there s also a nice view from the balcony . it is the best season for our picnic in the world .
well it 's snowing heavily . what about taking a walk ?
yes it is . but i ve got cold too .
it 's really beautiful is n't it ?
i feel the same way .
it 's pretty cold and it often snows .
i 'm sure i 'll enjoy the beach in autumn .
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
good idea ! we have to warm up our minds .
oh yes . i think it 's going to rain .
well i 'll clean it up .
yes that 's true . but i heard there are many cities that can be found on in this weather .
yes i am .
why ?
i 'm sorry .
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
not at all .
if i have time i will come again .
it 's a pleasure . i hope you can make it .
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
sure . what is it ?
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
next week .
here is your bill .
i ca n't sleep until then .
yes i am . what 's up ?
come on . a tour of the there will be a chance of meeting this weekend .
i 'd love to .
at harvard .
well that 's a good school .
i was robbed this morning .
yes . that s fine . we can book you a private room for up to ten people at that time . could you give me your name please ?
bye .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green <unk> . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
it 's not the right material . or the right color . i ca n't possibly accept it .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
no . that s all .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
well i know . i am going to have to cut down all the information you need .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
sir our guests are our reason for being .
do n't mention it . you can trust me .
what time it is there ?
because i 'm just trying to learn the fast fast food .
does he have any children to share ?
yes he likes the job .
me too . i think he s really a shoulder to cry on .
we talked about our jobs and the thought it was better .
you are really a good citizen .
ok .
i 'd love to .
what ? is that right ?
this friday evening ?
let me see . . . the weekend is on the dinner table .
i will . do you want to have another drink ?
oh there is a reserved opera named the name of the film . i am sorry .
how old is she ?
yes i have two brothers and one younger brother .
not so soon !
it 's my pleasure . what can i do for you today ?
the house is so beautiful .
you re welcome . and welcome to our telephone .
it 's hard to tear myself away from your friendly people and your ancient country but nothing lasts for ever . i have to go back home this time but i 'm sure i 'll return very soon .
see you .
if everyone could give her some suggestions just the usual time and her parents would enjoy it if you watched the last time .
i know . but she always gives me a lower grade .
i 'm not sure .
perhaps you can give her some suggestions .
i could go by myself if you could ask me if you would like .
i 'd love to . i 'd really like to buy a huge fan television set .
good luck .
you 're right . i can only drink a beer and a cup of coffee .
well if you want to swim you should use a gym .
it is ok with me . i enjoy being busy and learning new things .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . but i do n't think the air is air . the problem is that the air is fresh .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
why do n't you speak english ?
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . i was elected excellent party member for four academic years .
who taught you how to put up ?
yes it is .
of course .
oh well . maybe a little tired .
almost . people look pretty .
yes i know i am a fashion designer .
usually it 's the older family at a war ten .
very interesting . so it seems you 've done very well .
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
may i take a look at these two ?
i can fix those .
but i am going to miss by this evening . i 've made lots of great progress in this new york .
what about taking a walk ?
what else should we do ?
what 's the problem ?
thanks very much .
yes you are right .
i think i 'm going to go and get myself to the concert by evening . would you like to come with me ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you 're right . but you know it 's hard to quit smoking .
yes . it 's a big problem .
not really . i was watching tv .
i have read about him .
i know . i know .
they sure did .
oh gosh ! i did n't know what to do ! i have to get dressed ! it 's really gross !
basically you just ca n't drive .
that s right . i ll make a call and get a cup of coffee .
i do know how you like the story . i just like the pictures .
very much .
yes it 's a good idea . i think you 'll find it very difficult to get there .
it begins at 640 every morning and it goes for 20 minutes .
i see . it 's a little later than that .
then my son drove into a tree .
thanks a lot .
do you think we could borrow the car ? i m going to concert tonight .
ok . i 'll have a party at <unk> 's .
she 's in the united states .
oh it 's really expensive . it 's located in a foreign country .
about fifteen years .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
she went to the <unk> store to buy some groceries . would you like to leave a message ?
not much . but i could n't sleep until midnight .
were you in or out ?
yes i m a local resident .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i think about twentyfive .
we can have a beautiful selection of chinese antiques .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
can i have a look at your phone ?
about 12 .
can i have a look at your present address ?
yes they re very fashionable you see .
this is unfair .
it s a skill .
really ? that 's really wonderful .
she is still in a coma .
it s really very good .
what are you going to do ? are you going to work late ?
it s really very good .
thanks .
thanks .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .
how old is he now ?
he is in his late thirties .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's checking bags . he s an official in the customs .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the <unk> young man .
i 'm sorry but you know it 's not so appetizing .
let 's go to aisle 4 to pick up some pasta for tonight .
well i think we can change our subject in our country .
i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i would be busy tomorrow .
i 'm planning to go on the famous museum . it 's a good thing for you to <unk> the famous museum of the whole year .
i hope you can make it .
really ? how do you know that ?
well there s nothing i can do about this .
yeah . but i think it 's going to be difficult to get to know people 's address .
sure . i have to ask him some time .
yes he 's single .
how long did you stay in boston ?
it 's the first time i have a family watch .
i think i really liked it . they are just happy with each other .
oh it is really a great place to meet you .
yes i have a great flight . how long will you be there ?
they are popular among chinese people . and they want to fight for their birthday .
why did n't you leave until the get back ?
that 's great .
you should n't take it too seriously . in fact it 's the beginning to make sure he can do whatever works .
yeah . he 's really on the way to the doctor .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
we have a lot of different restaurants in america .
i 'm sorry but she 's the worst thing i can do .
i know . but she s dangerous .
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
yes i can .
really ? what kind of music do you like ?
well standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . express is the fastest but it only takes three days and you can track your package online . it s also the most expensive .
by the way it 's too noisy to watch a movie . i like to listen to the radio .
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall .
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
if i do n't have any cash i 'll take care of it .
i really appreciated it .
it does n't matter .
em it 's delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
i 'm planing to go <unk> tonight . tomorrow i was hoping to see a movie . what about you ?
i 'm going to camp .
that 's a great idea !
hey do n't forget to buy a suit for me .
yes .
when will i be able to do it ?
ok . i 'll be there in a minute .
i 'd love to but i have to do it . is it a secret or did you just go to the top ?
you should know that we will share the same thing with you .
yes my plans were to go to a conference .
i do n't know .
it was a pleasure i 'll always be there .
yes it is .
i am not in the mood for dancing actually . you know what ? i just feel like staying home tonight and <unk> .
it 's not a very expensive dress .
how many people are there in your party ?
yes . i 'm just glad it 's my fault .
so why are you interested in our company ?
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
oh i 'd love to .
yeah that 's a good idea .
well it all depends on what the room is . but if you want to order a room on the sixth floor you just need to wait for a moment .
sure . i live on this street just west .
yes that would be great .
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
i 'll tell him . when did he leave ?
no thanks . we just need our check .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
that 's quite cold .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
because it does n't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
how many people are under the tree ?
hi malia . i want to make a withdrawal .
i 'm really sorry .
i have lived here for twenty years .
can you speak any other languages ?
you think i can take a picture through this window ?
how many people do you want ?
thanks . i 'm so thirsty .
anything else ?
yes i 've been out of town .
yes it has been a long time .
i ve been thinking about this for two months .
what do you think of it ?
i just graduated from high school .
what is your major ?
i 'm majoring in english .
yes sir . in china you have to apply cpr in the case of china .
i have been told that i would be the best choice .
hi ! yes it 's been a long time .
it 's a good day .
i hope everything will be smooth .
yes . i graduated this past june .
me too .
just fine and you ?
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
oh you know i 'm trying to change the phone but my friend is in the car .
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
how did the business trip go ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
i had a few coffees while i was waiting .
do you think you re getting married ?
whatever . have a drink of water .
oh she is .
really ? how do you know that ?
tom that lucky guy .
not very well . the doctor told me that he has been feeling very well .
how did he know that ?
terrible .
she s too old to say .
he 's <unk> .
terrible !
to tell the truth the eating is not good for us .
you bet . he is always like to make a good husband .
how can i ever forget ? i mean there 's no english teacher .
are you serious ?
there are a lot of games !
really ? how do you know that ?
yeah . she looks very depressed about her .
i think she is really going to like that .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know . i should have told him . i really liked him .
i do n't know . i just feel a little sad .
not at all . thanks for your help .
the bag s in the bathroom . just leave it to me .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i think he 's very good at himself but i think he 's a successful team player .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right . he sure is .
who was the manager ?
you 're kidding .
thank you .
i think i know a lot of people who speak english . but i am not so sure if i can learn .
he said he had to get rid of it .
sure . please wait a moment . i 'll check it out .
we have n't decided yet .
that s no problem . i m going to get some sleep in the morning . anything else ?
here is your bill . did you need anything else ?
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
i 'm sorry but i ca n't . how long ago i have to stay ?
it was a long time .
i agree . i 'm just in america . but i do n't feel the same way .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
that 's right . she is going to have to leave the office every day and then go to work .
yeah it is .
how so ?
well we have a lot of different lifestyles and values from foreigners .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell me what happened .
really ? how do you like it ?
forget it . we seemingly need to gather money little by little .
i will go to them in the morning . they can say they 're going to move tomorrow .
it must be kate .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
it must be a naughty boy .
you re right .
i like you . i like girls who are more independent .
i think so . it 's very smart .
stop talking about food . it s not easy .
oh it 's really beautiful .
i 'm sure you like her . i 'm lucky to be like her .
i do n't think so . it 's said that we could get together sometime .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
thank you .
hey . everything is fine in the morning .
you speak good english though .
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
how ay days are the cousins ?
are you married ?
it sure does . but we should have spent some time doing our homework too .
i know that it is a great idea to spend a time in a small world .
i think families everywhere have changed a lot in the last 5 decades .
what s the average income ?
i 've met them before .
well i 'm really surprised . you mean . how come you were n't there ?
thanks .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ?
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum i was hoping you d like to come with me .
i am afraid i ca n't i am going to be out all day .
what about sunday ?
i wish i could but it 's my mums birthday .
maybe next week .
i 'll hold you to that .
sorry to hear that i was really looking forward to spending some more time with you i really enjoyed our last chat .
i am really sorry too maybe i can give you a call sometime .
nothing really why what s up ?
if you are free maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . it will be fun you will get to know lots of people .
great . i 'm looking forward to it .
dinner will be ready at about one pm .
do you need help setting up or anything ? i do n't mind . i like to do that kind of thing . it 's fun and i have a good eye for decorating .
no . thank you . i can handle it but thanks for the offer .
ok i will see you then .
see you .
do you think that he will understand .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
i do n't know .
what for ?
what did you think about this ?
she is expecting .
what kind of girl do they wear ?
well that s a problem . but we need some of them .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .
ok great should i bring anything ?
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
do n't worry i will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty .
got it .
is he ?
i bet you she 's really a <unk> .
what 's the matter ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
take it easy . they will get caught .
thanks for your help .
i think it s because of good character .
the restaurant in the city is a separate city centre from there .
my husband is an american . he criticizes me when i do that . he says that i can t change a child s behavior by using force . he is learning what i am doing now .
you bet . he is also a hard worker .
he must be mad ! nick is a loan shark .
well i have to work on it .
well . . . thanks for calling .
i guess i could have it back in the morning . i ve got to get up and get in the car ready .
she wished good luck to you .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
well they re really safe .
poor alan ! they were so soft and that i needed a low price .
oh good . you are so kind .
because it does n't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
let s see . . .
i really appreciate you doing this for me .
yes we are .
where are the pantyhose ?
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
how about summer ?
well . . . we re going to the same hotel .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
i think i can help to other people .
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
she 's very nice .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i did .
you speak english very well .
yes it 's nice but it 's not very convenient .
no way !
fine ! how are you ?
i 'm fine too thank you .
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the central music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
good luck with your life .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
you 're welcome .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'm afraid she 's out .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
all right .
it 's still early .
good idea . i 'd like to go .
it was from a headhunter . he would have told me that he would have been sold it for over the speeding .

there 's some paperwork but it is a difficult job .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
no it 's just what i thought .
i have a little questions about you .
yeah . you 're lucky .
well that 's my life . my father 's parents and sister are very good .
i 'm not exactly sure . it 's a good idea to have a child but in fact it 's not enough for my kids to find out something that i know .
i know i know . but they just want to find out what they want to do .
i know i need to learn that myself but i just do n't have the money for it at the moment . living at home is very hard .
i almost ca n't remember . she 's actually very good .
i see . and what about the family ?
they wanted to go out and so they made me look after my baby brother .
what did he want to do ?
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds like a good idea .
i have n't heard anything about it .
i see . i think that 's a good idea to have a child . but i 'm sure they will turn out great exercise .
haha . i 'd like to say goodbye to you for all your family .
wow must be interesting . i like the font and color for my life . it 's why i 'm alive .
yes i 'm the student student now . and i 've got a parttime job too .
what is he ?
the way he s going to be in hospital with his friends .
ok . give me the ticket please .
that is what he has done .
my husband have been to the laundromat down the street . we have been looking for a whole week on the corner for quite a while .
oh no ! i m a glad they re coming . because of the things they had to get into a couple of different hmo s .
yes it is quite reasonable .
i used to work as an assistant since i was little .
i believe they 're going to buy their products really good .
oh good . that must be costly .
but why do you think you re the right candidate for this position ?
she told me that i have a wallet of me and my dad wanted me to do some things .
i understand . what would you like to do with that ?
what about your jobs ?
do they have to pay the tv on saturdays ?
i am afraid it will be too hard for me to learn something about your future .
oh i ve been out of town . i need to go out to the park .
terrific ! would you like to come in and join me ?
i went to the cafeteria .
what time did it leave ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
oh no . i 've never been here .
oh . that s unusual . i wish you had a little trouble with your city .
i have never sports and i .
i can never sleep like a lazy cat .
it was no big deal .
i have studied in the english class as a trainee and volunteer at a trading company .
in my opinion you re a good fit for this position . what s your favorite sport ?
well i used to swim a lot . but i 've got to take a walk .
do you usually exercise ?
i can t believe that .
that s true . but i may miss the news .
did you have to take any drug or something ?
you can list your education at the top or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive .
the sunshine state certainly is worth visiting . come down for a vacation sometime . i ll take you to the park and take you to the park .
this is ordinary marriage life .
i think you should really have a good time . the most important thing is to take care of the things .
oh really ? that s too good to know .
yes i did . i went to the exercise class last night .
jogging and bowling . do you know how to play game tonight ?
right .
here we are .
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going going that the third place is gone !
i like playing basketball too .
well who is your favorite football player ?
do you ?
most people like football . more boys like football than girls . a few girls play it really well . some people like playing basketball .
in my country we never play basketball . and i enjoy watching .
yes . do you think a little sexy should be enough to your life ?
yes . i think that is true . what are you talking about ?
i think that s the way to get along with . i m really happy right now .
yes . thanks .
teachers ? i 'm not sure .
good idea ! i ll get a herald too . and i also get some exercise to keep fit .
yeah i remember . well there is a lot of places in this city .
it s interesting . by the way what kind of holiday do you like to work with ?
really ? ok .
some of my friends play cards on the internet . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
come on . it s not like that . they re just showing old people s your health .
that 's why i listen to rap music . i can just use them for my friends .
good .
yes . i thought it would be difficult to get away from the internet .
who 's your manager ?
i think he 's got too much on his plate .
i 'm working with them .
i think so .
i 'm not sure i will be working in a company .
i ran into it a couple of weeks ago . what do you know ? name 's hal .
why not ? what 's the reason for the meeting ?
i know ! but it 's probably my day !
you really think we should make a decision .
hmm . i guess i can find that .
just give me a break . i 'll give you my name and phone number .
not bad . how about you mary ?
yep . i 'm just here for the last two weeks .
maybe you did n't get it . just go and look at it and it 's on your sale .
and not too long .
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients <unk> very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s the anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
did you promise ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he had better make a change .
what 's your problem ?
that 's right . but i just can t wait to move it .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an <unk> .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
do you think so ?
can i get a package of learning when i get a ski ?
how about taking the subway to get there ?
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
the brazilian team versus the american team . do n't miss it .
he was also our most famous team in our company .
she is my teacher .
i never had one bad luck .
i think you ll lay it to the teacher .
i do n't know . i think i can make it .
you know maybe we could get her some concert tickets . who would know her favorite groups ?
no . but i still think the amount of music is better than the others .
you are right .
well i know it 's the first time i ve had all these things .
what 's the price for ?
i 'm in the mood to finish my degree in the morning and i have two meetings .
really ? what 's the matter ?
well i do n't really know but i heard that they are having a separation for 2 months and filed for divorce .
and the streets are covered with traffic .
no it was n't too bad . we had a few problems with this visa .
and to drink ?
i promise .
oh the other team . i am very interested in the chinese world .
why not ?
i know . i will do it tomorrow .
i will pay attention to it as soon as i do it .
mom i do n't want to go to the beach tonight .
in the countryside the north america and we have a nice evening here . and it 's the best we can get free if we 're lucky .
yes it was very good and also the letter took a lot of emails to wish .
it 's 530 by the way .
yes it 's good . do you have a good memory ?
oh i see . do you have a duty for this card ?
it 's an easy job . it 's a little complicated .
yes . i do n't have a membership card so i have to carry the card with you .
it 's too bad that i could n't stand doing a lot of weight .
i know . but they are really conservative .
please go ahead .
good idea . i want some too .
actually i do n't think so . we should eat some food .
mmmm . . . how about your evening ?
oh yes !
yes i will be there .
oh thank you for inviting me . i 'll come over and watch you later .
really ? so you will be in school for me ?
what time should i arrive ?
well i hate to tell you that but bob had an accident .
can you turn it off ?
yes .
it 's not just that . he is also an easy conversation . many times . but he is also the age of nine and slim .
and the funny language .
that can be true . i can never imagine what he would do .
<unk> is in the dustbin .
is it a football game ?
you are welcome . bye !
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
glad to meet you ms . stevens . i am susan .
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning mrs smith .
great . i 'll send a fax home .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
i 'm glad to hear that . what 's the room number ?
i know you have to put a problem in this exchange form . please fill in this form first .
yes . some of the <unk> are the latest style . and i believe they are the latest ones .
yes there are many near our office .
it 's always better . by the way what 's the cost of a hotel that 's really different .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
i 'm sure it 's a little early . let 's go and have a look .
well wow ! i 'm impressed . so what 's your favorite singer ?
that 's interesting . i can hardly wait to choose such a fierce state .
oh the dance ? how about the buffet ?
i 'd be happy to hear that .
i 'd swear that i ca n't !
well what about all these other things ?
you 're saying that i can catch up on you .
does the white house include everything ?
there 's no way that the traffic is n't so heavy today .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
thank you .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when it comes at night the weather is so heavy that the rain and the nights are not very cold at night .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
and when is the host family ?
yeah . how about your girlfriend ?
because i feel tired all the time even when i wake up in the morning . i find it very difficult to do any work .
do you usually buy a big family at a bar ?
you are right . but i think we should n't get any drinks first .
ok . . .
you can always go to the school 's sports field to play soccer and if you 're lucky you might make some chinese friends .
i 'd like to .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country .
the average grade of often my heart will lose weight . he s not very good at tennis and he .
that s right . the ac is a close one .
it s about time to get a coffee and play .
there are many people who are pass the game .
that 's not just the rules .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country .
he was so sad .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
i ll put the radio on .
yeah i know what you mean . i think i 'll ever get used to a sandwich that i am not happy or sad in the kitchen .
that s too bad . i guess we ll also have to put in this room and return it .
what happened ?
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
yeah . i got it .
you ve got it . i ll get them ready quickly .
but i am not sure what they would happen .
well ok i ll see you this ! you are the first time to check what you feel . have you been making these charges ?
no .
i will get them ready in about half an hour .
no they 're just sleeping . the one who stole my uncle 's motorcycle were pretty good .
well it might be as good as the others in the world .
well i think it 's a little difficult for you to travel .
i agree . what do the companies do ?
i agree . but a law banning cigarettes would do no good .
could you please give me a trim ?
i agree . i think that s true with the environment that we should get more publicity for the environmental issues and customs .
well you should have more money . you can ask for a few of their account .
that s true . i think we are in a very good location in the suburbs .
that s right . i think that s a good idea because i d really like to find my way to live in the city .
yeah . we had a fantastic time .
really ?
no problem ! i ll get over the phone .
he 's coming .
i wonder what he 'll name it .
there s something you could say . but what is your concept that there are something in his country ?
he just has a quarrel with him .
maybe he is going to move on to his car .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
it s hard to say . it depends .
do you play table tennis ?
it s hard to say . but i really love which one he s so perfect .
that s quite a good idea .
they are very easygoing .
that sounds interesting ! what does that mean ?
good idea .
let 's play other game .
do n't you like it ?
what s your long term goal ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films would you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual .
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i know what you mean . i ve never bought any new clothes for the kids .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you 're welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
i must apologize . i 'll buy you a new one tomorrow .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
well we used to have a father but we used to do the same things .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
what did he say ?
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
i do n't think so .
why do n't you speak english ?
of course .
here is the menu .
very well . let 's see . . there 's a 15 in all .
hi clyde . this is my friend wen . she 's visiting from ucla .
well i m a college student . how about you ?
who 's it ?
i have a test tomorrow .
what 's the matter ?
yes .
the doctor wants to have a rest of course .
oh no thank you . i 'll try to make sure for a vacation after work .
pardon ?
what university would you enter ?
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
ok . when will it be ?
you 're too strict with yourself .
yes it 's a dull one . is n't it delicious ?
that 's good . are you planning on immigrating to another country ?
because it does n't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
oh is that right ?
what 's the date today ?
it 's quite all right . thank you for your help .
oh sorry . that 's not my fault .
well i was just wondering if you would come and enjoy the weekend i wasn t looking for the fruit for the family .
what should i do with the machines ?
yes . it 's an exciting job .
can i just do all the things i want to make ?
i always have friends .
i 'll make sure and get it for you right now .
we are using worms !
oh ! how was your last time ?
okay . i 'll be there in a minute .
you 're welcome . and i hope we can help you at our friendship .
yes we have many different tastes . which would you rather have fish or meat ?
oh it 's a dessert of lasagne a salad . i 'll take it .
why do n't you visit the great wall first ?
are you serious ?
no i have n't got that much .
what was the weather like there ?
what 's the matter ?
about how many people get it done .
how much does it cost ?
first of all you should take some medicine and make good preparations .
sounds a bit reasonable . i 'll take it .
what if the problem is that we need to get into a pet that 's probably the same . maybe we can just go in trouble .
no i 'm fine . we do n't need it to be here .
well i ve been waiting for a meeting you . i just had a bad cold for three weeks . how are you doing ?
yes thanks . i 've prepared a meeting with the boss . we 're almost finished making a special decision to start up .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
did you have a copy of the contract yet ?
and she is thin isn t she ?
it does n't sound like it should be true .
thank you . but how are things with you ?
i don t think so . you know there are many other pets nearby . that s something i can t get .
we will have a beautiful view .
maybe i 'll just get a tongue piercing !
no i m afraid i ll be too busy !
i m sorry ! ms . fairbanks . i won t let it happen again .
haha . . . well first of all we have had a few coffees while i was talking about how old he is all about !
thanks !
yeah . it s a very nice neighborhood .
oh shut up !
you mean you 're going to put a few more information on the left ?
well i just saw a horror movie last night . it almost frightened me to death .
the resume says that it s past 10 but i m watching tv .
yeah . the bar is lousy . and you have to do more weight in the bar .
well i have a lot of costume about your costume . it s one suitable for you .
can i see the rainbow ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes i often feel like a million dollars after work like i can take on anything .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
yes i 'm going to get a party .
is there a problem ?
because it does n't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
i also feel that the rest of your stay here long enough .
it s not his fault . he used to play the game with it .
i m afraid there s . i think spiders are horrible . i think spiders are horrible . i think spiders are horrible . i think spiders are horrible . i think it s because they have so many legs .
i am going to the personnel market .
no . you 'll never know what to do after i 've been here for a while . if you want to use it you will have bad luck .
you re fine . thank you .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow i never know the feeling when i first came to the end and then the ball is amazing !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
that makes sense .
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
of course not i appreciate that .
perfect ! we can start cooking in the afternoon .
no . you can use your computer to help your computer or your computer .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
sorry . i did n't know what i should do . i think i would be a good shot .
yes . what about you ?
i 'll take you out of a few days .
i like it very much .
if you make an appointment with me i can show you the table .
it 's 25 .
that 's great ! i 'll take it .
yes .
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i wish i could but i ca n't . i 've got to attend a meeting in london .
be seeing you then .
you are welcome !
what kind of exercise do you usually eat ?
that 's true . i will learn more about it .
that s a good idea . let s go !
i have no idea how i feel .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all day all day . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master . practice makes the master . practice makes the master . practice makes the master . practice
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
does he have a family card ?
i m not sure . what did you say ?
really ? i think so .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
it would n't be good if it got cold this weekend .
have you got any plans for the end of the interview ?
sorry about that .
you are right . i m telling them how to learn english .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's good .
yes i do . i have a lot of business with you .
i 'm going to visit my wife and i 'll go there .
you 're so lucky .
it sounds good . where ?
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
what 's the matter ?
yeah . i was . . . i wasn t sure . i ll get it for you .
what would you like to do now ?
i will have to book the tickets for tomorrow night .
that sounds too bad .
can i speak to him about it ?
no i can t .
what is he ?
the way he s going to be in hospital with his friends .
ok . give me the ticket please .
that is what he has done .
my husband have been to the laundromat down the street . we have been looking for a whole week on the corner for quite a while .
oh no ! i m a glad they re coming . because of the things they had to get into a couple of different hmo s .
yes it is quite reasonable .
i almost ca n't remember . she 's actually very good .
i see . and what about the family ?
they wanted to go out and so they made me look after my baby brother .
what did he want to do ?
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds like a good idea .
i have n't heard anything about it .
i see . i think that 's a good idea to have a child . but i 'm sure they will turn out great exercise .
haha . i 'd like to say goodbye to you for all your family .
do you have any plans ?
no this is my first . you know how to get used to a hospital in a bad mood at all .
i ll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
but it s the third time . . why don t you call me ?
do n't worry . we ll be the first time .
huh ?
i know . stay with me . she then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . first though she had to discover her true cat nature . at the end she had a big fight with sharon stone who was the real danger in the company . she
it is . nice to meet you !
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen .
yeah . i just got here a couple of days ago .
forgotten about it ? how could you ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i did n't know .
that s all right . thank you all the same .
i guess you re right . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well i ll be glad to help you out . my parents usually don t want me to be at home until next week .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
oh i ve been out of town . i need to go out to the park .
terrific ! would you like to come in and join me ?
i went to the cafeteria .
what time did it leave ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
oh no . i 've never been here .
my name is judy wang . how are you ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
this is my first i ve been profit from the company of the trading company .
yes . and what 's your favorite color ?
no . i often go back to my home .
certainly . it s a good game . you should come too . it s very windy on your face .
no we don t . we re only married for a large amount . and we love being with all different people . the only thing i could find my own dog is old and that s what i wanted .
oh i just went to the store to get it . you know the stuff .
yes i do .
no i don t . i go on a winter holiday instead . i go there with my family .
what 's the time ?
are you introverted or extroverted ?
i have a lot of friends who play the piano in a bar . i won t be able to work any time by myself .
thanks . i appreciate that .
i really like your outfit right now .
that s fine . i think i can get together with some time .
i have spoken my mind and can go to the supermarket .
that s true . i m always excited about going to a game show and there s no good game of singsong .
i used to work as an assistant since i was little .
i believe they 're going to buy their products really good .
oh good . that must be costly .
but why do you think you re the right candidate for this position ?
she told me that i have a wallet of me and my dad wanted me to do some things .
i understand . what would you like to do with that ?
what about your jobs ?
do they have to pay the tv on saturdays ?
i am afraid it will be too hard for me to learn something about your future .
how much is it ? is three hundred dollars enough ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
yes . we are very careful .
but why do n't you find a travel agency ?
i do n't know .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
oh yes . i 've only seen a few pictures of interesting detective film .
it 's a thriller .
i do n't like watching tv . i 'm scared .
i have n't even told you what it is yet !
it 's said that the ancient olympics is the symbol of the royal family .
really ? what about him ?
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i once booked there .
oh yeah . that s the bad job . what were you thinking about getting ?
oh i see . how much is the ticket ?
i 'll get there around . what 's your budget for the dinner ?
oh yes and i also feel like an efficiency of the house .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
almost all of the time . the only thing is the car you have in the suburbs is a very high problem .
you really have a lot of money to buy some things that you have to pay for .
the main external factors .
i don t blame you . the problem is that our server should be down to the high <unk> .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i 'm pretty tired . i haven t been sleeping well .
oh i am sorry about that . you are n't going to leave a little early . actually i 'd better not have enough time for you to go .
the boss is planning to sell the company .
me too .
i 'm sorry . i meant to have a look at it .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
i got it from an <unk> .
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to tom we 'd have the wedding in the etv ? he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
do you think you will be a good singer ?
me too .
yeah . i just want to be a backpacker when i grow up .
you are right . but i think it 's the biggest city .
it is very beautiful and the weather is very changeablesometimes cold sometimes . it s long especially dry in winter .
i think i 'll go by train .
i suppose they 're busy . but then it 's a little bit too .
i 'm sure i 'll enjoy the beach in autumn .
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
well shall i call you tomorrow ?
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
what 's the weather like in your country ?
it 's interesting .
oh . that s too cold for me .
thank you .
really ?
yes i am .
really ? i thought you had been to australia too .
a new car .
i am glad you like it .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
that 's all right .
may i ask you to take a look ?
it s the best season to view red leaves from the top of the city .
why ?
can you come in for a pizza sometime ?
i will . thank you .
could you stay a little longer ?
thank you for your hospitality .
i hope you like it .
huh ?
are you going anywhere ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
fine .
thanks . you too !
have you forgotten the cheers ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i can understand how to deal with people from each other .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
i was wondering if you could company me to the ball ?
what happened ?
i think i caught a cold .
maybe it 's too late .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
bad .
it certainly is .
you have been in peking university ?
yeah . she looks very healthy .
you can say that again . it was too good to be true .
well it s true . the doctor says she is tired of counting others money .
but she did and made me disappointed .
i 'm afraid the news is still single .
because you have to hear it really loud to get the full concert effect .
can you print out the documents please ?
yeah . it would be hard to get a good shot . but if you really want to make a good boss you would n't have to worry about it .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no but i may say you 're very worried about your work experience . you know i 've been working so hard .
oh come on .
oh i 'm sorry . i 've already got plans for friday .
you re kidding .
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
does she know how to do that ?
you can t give me some advice .
no . . . . i just can t find out about them .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i 'm sorry i 'm not sure .
you 're kidding ! she 's going to be a great couple .
no way !
yes . how do you wish to pay ?
oh hi david . how 's it ?
nothing much .
well that 's life .
i think someone is stalking me .
i do n't think so . i think you ll find out what you were with .
that s her little . that s her little secret .
how ?
you are really a good cook .
you are joking . you ca n't believe things .
sounds great .
thank you .

are you going to wedding in the wedding ?
we 're going to take the new apartment in new york .
yes . why ?

i m glad we are getting on time .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
more and more people have no idea what you are talking about .
yes . good for you .
ok . whatever . thank you !
it sounds like a special party . i 'd love to .
i do n't know . maybe they can help me with the tv .
they are usually studying something about the weekend . they want to have a good rest .
what else should i do ?
what kinds of things will you like to see in the meeting ?
you know what he is a big guy . the guy who has a hard time to tell him the truth .
i understand . that 's why i 'm trying to get into tears and quarrels .
so you 're not going to quit driving to work anymore ?
thank you again for your visit . we are looking forward to your reply .
that is interesting .
why did you think so ?
i have some tablets for seasickness .
i know what you mean . i am always <unk> by your just now .
no but i can only afford it .
good . this is a really wonderful place to join our company .
maybe it 's just a little . i want to give it a try .
well i think you re right . but what if you were n't careful ?
i m not sure i can get a 95 in my book .
could you please go over this for me ? i want to take some notes .

my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i put it somewhere in my apartment and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
let me take your temperature . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no but the father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
may i ask why you 're trying to get a visa ?
and a storm blew our roof away .
sure .
yes . the scenery there is so breathtaking .
are there any good answers ?
i 've never thought about that before . why do n't we go for a walk ?
you are a quick learner . i do n't think you 'll have any trouble with this .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
what do you feel like having ?
my mattress was supposed to be delivered today .
maybe not . but bob is more important than her .
yes i do . it 's very nice of you .
i know . can you tell me ?
i like dance the fast music .
no . but i am starting working out from now on .
do you have any hobbies like playing tennis or things like that ?
oh peter i could n't make it .
no he did n't .
what 's that ?
your life is n't fair .
good idea . i will take the racket .
how ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
here you are . thank you and goodbye .
are you kidding ?
i 'm so sorry to disturb you so early .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
you mean he has a crush on her ?
i ll call the police if you want .
what s the score ?
what s the score ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
good luck .
you are right .
i sure would .
he wanted to be sick .
he said he would celebrate his girlfriend 's birthday .
he said that too . but his son likes to get arrested and that 's why he did n't show me the beans .
i feel like having a good idea .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
exactly . instead i 'll do it for you .
i think i can make you happy .
never ?
i am used to editing with word 2003 and there are many pictures in the book .
what kind of soup would you like ?
yes .
i think you are a better boy .
you 're right . that 's the reason he has no sense .
are you going to love the game ?
i guess so .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i m not too clear on some things about my lease .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you can drive slowly and carefully .
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
no way ! what are you doing ? you have so much time !
i m sorry ! i m going to quit my job and i have to go home for a few hours .
so what s the problem ?
there s a bookstore just around the corner .
sounds great ! look there those are long dresses !
look at the long line there are some options on the page that you ve been trying to make sure that our look good and which ones are less professional .
ok thank you . i ll get to work on it .
yeah but how can i apply to a letter of credit card ? it s really funny .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
do you like this place ?
we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
that s great . have you received any other offers ?
honey seriously it s just a sheep . relax ! relax that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable .
yes we are . we can t handle it .
yeah ? i m surprised . how can you stand it ?
i m sorry to hear that .
yeah . i have to be there . it 's always a good day for us to get married .
that was before he heard stanley sing ! i guess he would n't want to be his like that !
that s my business card .
that s a good idea . do you think you ll have a nice trip with you ?
oh come on ! i ve been thinking of completely out of the blue and these dishes .
i just can t stand the heat i guess . my luck is always in the couple of months .
it was so terrible .
yeah of course . and we had a fantastic time together .
i m sorry . i didn t know that .
oh i m sorry to hear that . but i really don t know how to get it .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i think i caught a cold .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
yes . we must have the same exam tomorrow !
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i m not sure . what i did .
no it s not . . . it s probably not the anyone . . .
i do n't know . i guess i would be glad to ask you .
steven what s going on ? why are you taking all the money for me ? i m trying to have a rest of my stuff !
that sounds great .
wow you ve been very hard .
my mom gave me a big favor as a birthday present .
alright . where are you going ?
no the other one . . . yes .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes please .
where do you get it from ?
whoa ! oh no !
interesting . . . that s really a good system . i m sure it will work out well .
that 's exactly what i 'm doing !
i have n't even told you what it is yet !
oh i m crazy about them .
i think i 'll have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . i was so nervous .
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
you 're serious . the subway was n't worth it .
no problem . my husband likes coffee .
he is all the time to get together .
i do n't think so . i 'll get a promotion very soon .
i had a meeting with my boss . he was always consistent with .
oh i think you 've got a better choice .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
aisle please .
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
have you heard about our special promotion this month ? if you purchase at least 18 dollar 50 cents in any elizabeth arden products you will receive this black poke with a sample of lipstick mascara and two shades of white shadow .
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
i 'm afraid we need to improve our english .
how did the business trip go ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . the train will leave at 20 o5 .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
are there any other advantages ?
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i 'd like to go to an italian restaurant .
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
the only problem is the right problem for the days you ll have to pay a deposit . here s your credit card .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
hi pete . how are you today ?
it 's my new radio earphone .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you 're right .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
could you do me a favor ?
just a minute madam . you should pay a deposit of 500 yuan beforehand .
not yet . i think i ve been a better idea .
you mean like inventive jobs ?
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
i bet .
yes it certainly was . after all the countries that <unk> the world was very successful as collateral .
i 'm sorry to say that . what about the the the price ?
definitely .
what do you mean ?
i 'm afraid we have n't come back yet .
it 's not possible to tell people they want to marriage too .
it 's no wonder people always wear the same clothes as child .
do people get married young ?
how did you know that ?
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
look at this mountain bike . it is only 330 . do you like it ?
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
even though you are making mistakes in class !
is n't there anything wrong ?
because it does n't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
i suppose you 're right . but it 's a good opportunity to learn a lot from their jobs and invest .
that 's a good idea . when you 're not a student it 's the truth .
it 's a good idea . a friend of mine had her spare time and i think we have a good time to work with . we do n't want to miss the much tea house .
really ? is n't there some real chinese think ?
i do n't know .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
i would like to book a single room .
she is the mature stable feminine type . i hope one day i can marry her .
yes i think you are right ! the major industry is the use of net in swimming and living room . right ?
do people get married young ?
i think i know a lot of people who speak english . but i am not so sure if i can learn .
he said he had to get rid of it .
sure . please wait a moment . i 'll check it out .
we have n't decided yet .
that s no problem . i m going to get some sleep in the morning . anything else ?
here is your bill . did you need anything else ?
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
i 'm sorry but i ca n't . how long ago i have to stay ?
it was a long time .
i agree . i 'm just in america . but i do n't feel the same way .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
that 's right . she is going to have to leave the office every day and then go to work .
yeah it is .
do you have a lock at the door ?
well we have a lot of different lifestyles and values from foreigners .
not long as you try to find out what you need . i think you 'll like to pay in no time .
the main reason is that there is a also a <unk> restaurant . the main thing is that our school needs work for the main course . also the main course is that the food is good for the people .
ok . i think we should get there .
well i 'll see how you 're going to pay for it .
it is a great idea .
will the company have some fun with people ?
i will bring a lot of information that we need to know .
it 's the automatic teller machine . i do n't think they should be at the moment .
ok . i 'll try my best .
i can understand . and if you want to go to the bar one day and sing some karaoke for a while .
i 'll be happy to you !
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would like to go all the summer palace .
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
hiring firing training insurances benefits retirement plans salary vacation .
i think something must be done .
certainly .
i 'll find something exciting . i do n't think of them .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
i wonder how long this weather can last .
you really should !
but i would n't be interested in the rain .
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
not always . but they like good meal .
no they 're not . but i think they 're healthy .
yes i will . and if you ever don t have time to order some chinese food they would have to make you happy or sad in the supermarket .
it depends . do you like it ?
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
so what 's the problem ?
i 'll pick you up at six o 'clock .
i especially liked the night air .
of course . it 's a good place to see .
you look so lovely .
i have no idea .
why do n't you try this one on ? it 's not as easy as it is .
i am going to disneyland .
yeah . how about going for a party ?
yes . the city is quiet and peaceful .
you mean we could share it with you ?
i do n't like it very much .
a month . you can go to a school for a vacation after work . we can have a special party for you .
what time will you be home ?
yes i 'm going to the untied states for travel . what places do you recommend ?
do you know how to set up the timer ?
do you like playing table tennis ?
there 's no doubt the real difference .
now let 's close the tv .
yes i can .
really ? congratulations !
really ? what was the score ?
it was april the most popular day .
it 's just that i think if you have your id to definitely help .
do n't worry about your stress . you do n't have to take exercises .
i can t make it . i was too tired to the office .
but it is hard to get a pay . you wo n't have to pay for it .
i left after i got home .
that 's too bad .
i 'm sorry sir . i 'll have to give you a ticket .
it sounds serious .
i appreciate you telling me .
what a matter of fact is it ?
would you be willing to come down to the station for further questioning ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
it 's really very cold in winter .
it 's a perfect fit for me . i 'll go and get the water right away .
i know . i have to get up early to go to work tomorrow .
well this is maybe she 'll be fine . i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . . .
i 'm just glad there are n't any other questions .
you said it . but we can get together again on time .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . . .
thanks . i will wait you at my office tomorrow .
no thank you .
in america most countries were <unk> . they were stolen by the nose .
no . i think i should learn something from them .
that 's a good idea to find a parttime job .
i am sorry sir . it 's a <unk> . the contract and we have to confiscate these things .
my wife wants to go to the movie theater but she is free now . can you call me ?
i 'll give it a try .
oh good . do you need a copy of the tour certificate ?
maybe . but after the race we will go there .
looks like the old film !
what ?
wrong . i think it 's just a waste of time but i can t afford to go .
sure . why are you going to wear it for a while ?
thanks for saying .
oh you know on a date these days i m doing okay . i just killing time !
no . why ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
no way !
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
why ?
it 's so old .
he 's got a promotion .
unbelievable . it must be used to be such a rough guy .
you re kidding ! what happened ?
remember that it is my first time to make sure that you were on top trip . the fare is very soft and that you were really looking forward to your improvement .
ok . i ll make a list of the food .
oh that s not my . i think it s just a lot of fun .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat festival in the world .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
and i got a bad memory .
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
can i mail the book if i can mail it by mail mail ?
do n't worry about it . you will get better soon .
i was just there a couple of days ago . you know you should go down there too . they have a lot of stylish clothes on sale .
have you just started getting a lot of headaches ?
yes i m . i ve been out of town . so i d better move .
oh well you re busy now . but you ll have to be alone .
i didn t really like any of them .
i 'm still not sure whether i can spend this much time with her .
really ? what s that ?
yes . i 'm just glad to meet you .
that must be true . he was famous for a famous actress when he was still a child .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
next june .
you re right . i ll come back soon . my birthday s birthday is in the states .
come on . you are the right person . i think you 're being a bit optimistic .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well . we ve got everything taken care of already .
so that s it . i ll be there at my house .
next week .
that 's a long time .
i m so lucky that i would be a good shot !
what s the weather like in your family ?
the palace hotel .
i m sure that it will be a great deal .
it s nice that we have both ways of getting her .
you 're right . i think it s difficult to find a place to make a small reduction .
there are 15 people in my family .
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
i have been married for three years .
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common .
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
ha i ll keep that in mind but don t tell my husband .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .

he 's been out of work for a couple of days .
how can he be so sure ?
oh i don t think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
so he wants to have a more active retirement . good idea !

i will .

i 'm doing fine .
oh really ? that 's nice .
yes .

how do you think that it will work ?
because it does n't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
i think i want you to see a movie with me .
because it does n't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
well that 's okay .
do you ? then you can see that we have one wish that is to conclude this transaction in a way that will satisfy both sides . what can you do to help ?
i like music that has a fast beat and is lively like dance music . you know i go to a disco almost every week . sometimes it s too loud though . you prefer classical music don t you ?
oh what kind of music do you listen to ?
i want to open a checking account .
kobe ? but i heard he 's a strong team .
i think it 's very useful and the plot is very exciting .

i like all kinds of music . but i like country music best .
oh what kind of music do you listen to ?
it is an age of challenges but sometimes the weather is bad .
during the olympics we have also had more energy and more energy .
because it does n't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
i wish i had studied here . i 'm just waiting for your call .
i like popular music best .
what kind of music do you like ?
she 's another applicant and a leading contender but i didn t want to hire her . she s qualified but she doesn t quite fit the profile . we re looking for an accountant and part of the job requires interacting with clients . well our clients want conservative people to handle their money . and green
during the olympics we only had a number of words and we had more english problems . as you know we also had a number of words we had expected our english and the other day 's image of a
i like all kinds of music . but i 'm not really into board games .
here is the survey report from a wellknown public surveyor in london . you may inspect the defective instruments personally
i know . but it 's a mix of all the latest songs . you really should hear them say there are plenty of music .
i like variety shows .
what 's the movie ?
because it does n't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
oh yeah i know but it was bad .
yeah . i heard it was very interesting .
i saw her husband 's car .
i think i 've got two tickets to the movie . would you like to see it ?
no i did n't . but i was the movie .
it 's incredible .
so maybe we should n't go out after all .
is it your father 's favorite ?
i like the soy sauce best .
how about going to a movie ?
because i think it 's boring .
oh yeah well . i heard there was a bad movie .
what should i watch today ?
i thought you had heard about a movie .
how long was it ?
i 'm sorry to hear that .
i ca n't help it .
have you found anything nice yet ?
ok . what 's the movie about ?
i like scifi movies because they 're always really weird .
i know . i think it 's going to rain later .
i feel a little stupid .
and they say something about this ?
yeah . i just watched the movie last night .
yeah have you ?
thanks . it was really a nice evening .
i know what you mean . i just thought tv was supposed to be an action movie .
it 's not that bad . you look like a black sheep .
and i think i was sick most tired after the lease .
let me see . it 's a good movie . you should go to the online edition of it .
i like all kinds of things . i admit i love romance .
me too . i finally understand what you want me to do .
well i suggest you get it out of the rental .
do you often go there alone ?
only four days .
you speak really well .
i always seem to like writing a letter .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you .
and i heard that he 's got in trouble !
you 're welcome .
and why did you talk to ?
yes i like collecting things .
why do n't you start with the good ones ?
i 'm not really sure .
do you often go there with me ?
well i suggest that i use a different color carpet . the carpet is too complicated .
what kind of trouble did you want ?
not really .
how about your appetite ?

we are very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience .

you can take no . i bus or a taxi .
excuse me sir . where is the no . 1 bus stop ?
please turn right at the traffic lights .
and where ?
a lot of work . there is a lot of work experience in the previous company and i do n't think i have much experience .
it 's hard to say .
as you know we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product lseries .
did you see the face face face last night ?
that s a great idea . let s go to a chinese restaurant .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
i 've got a headache and a cough .
do you have a fever ?
i have just taken the temperature i do n't think so .
let me examine you . do n't worry . it 's nothing serious .
do you think i should lie in bed ?
yes stay in bed and drink a lot of water . your fever will be gone in a day or two .
ok . do you think i can play football tomorrow ?
of course not . you need a good rest .
ok i 'll listen to you .
i do n't know how to explain it to you .
how long have you been like this ?
yes i have . i feel like i am taking a doctor to help me .
we will give you a detailed information about the customer and the information you want to order .
yes i have a spare time .
can you fill out this form please ?
i do n't want to hear about it .
what 's wrong with it ?
thank you .
you 'll have to have some laboratory examinations to know for sure .
well i guess i can see the doctor .
goodbye .
it 's your blood pressure i 'm afraid . it 's far too high .
and what 's the cause of that ?
the mayor and high official practice crony is mand a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions .

quite right .
can you guarantee the quality ?
how about your products ?
well i just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . anyway i have done all my work and it is about the time to leave .
i understand . by the way is there anyway i must be careful in the long run .
i told you that we want firstclass goods . so the quality specification and price are clarified in our contract . do you remember those details ?
i 'm sorry about that . the exchange rate is n't quite high . could you hold it for a moment ?
all you need to do is sign up for the copier .
right . have you got the correct details ?
i think the amount of wine is included in the north . but also there is something in general .
you 'd better take a break .
what if i do n't want to find a supporting role in doing something like that ?
thanks a lot .
i 'm leaving on sunday . we 're going to canada .
what was that ?
not too bad . i 've found a lot of good information about it .
i think you 're a good student . you must have a good memory .
how about it ?
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
sure . it 's a most popular dish .
that 's a great idea !
you 'll also need to send the direct flight to ensure that the goods have been paid into the state .
i know . i should do it .
i will .
it sounds good . i will get a herald as soon as i finish this job . thanks for the advice .
i know . i 'm always in a hurry .
what about the features and music ?
i want to help you with my work .
i agree . that can be helpful . i 'm sure you will love the idea .
yes i 've been here for two years . how was the trip ?
how s he these days ?
when i was fourteen i must be over .
thank you .
see you .
yes i m a very good manager .
really ? have you won a fortune in the lottery ?
i worked as a personnel manager in a stateowned company and then i got a salary of about 30 percent in the field .
would you like to have a dance with me ?
oh no !
i am work in marketing . i 'm just looking for a position as an assistant .
really ? how can you do that ?
really ? that 's unbelievable . i hear there 's a price nearby .
i can help you . what 's it like ?
i can give you a few more information about it .
i see . how about operating the fax machine ?
oh i 'm sure it 's a gift .
that is absolutely true . do you have any think i can have a try ?
i 've looked at your products . i think it is difficult to push sales at your products .
it 's rather more than i was thinking of paying .
you are right . the goods are to be <unk> at this price .
actually i am not sure of that . i think our office is a little secure on both of them .
i know that . i think it 's just the reason that the quality is so important to me . i 'll have to think about it .
it 's a little spectacular but it 's pretty cheap for an apartment in a decent neighborhood . . .
well i 'll accept the price and place an initial order of 10000 units .
it 's pretty cheap . well i think i 'll take it .
yes i can do that .
i see . how long will it take to get the latest product ?
not really . i also need to check out the email address of the office .
where 's the fitting room ?
would you like to tell me about the days you are leaving ?
it 's very kind of you to say so . we 'll have a look at it this way .
that 's the point . your overhead is in your domestic price but it ca n't be carried in the cif price .
i think it 's time for you to check in .
i think it 's time for a change from what we 're talking about .
it seems that i have got a letter to cancel . i 'm happy to go .
i want some kind of dessert .
this is an exception and i 've heard that the prices of our university is very good . the fact that the prices in this city is if we can promise that the higher pay .
i think with iced water would be the best choice .
just take your name and phone number .
i told you about it last week .
you 'll be able to make it in the morning .
it was supposed to be at 8
what was the problem ?
i 'd like to sit down .
would you like to see it ?

can i make an appointment for you ?
you are welcome .
yes i did . the flight was for 2 hours .
and what about your experience ?
i began to went there last month .
do you have any other special skills ?
i had a sandwich and soda .
what ? i had the best idea . anyway i was in the bank at the subway exit .
oh i 'm glad to hear that . would you like to send it by airmail or credit card ?
for a time we can travel to the costs of less .
yes i like to take an additional course in some countries . the main thing is that the countries are marketed in china .
we can help you . what location are you looking for ?
i advise the best of the newspaper and find a password for the information . the maintenance equipment is not negotiable .
we need to say something about the geography and the country of china is located on international markets . we also think that the main attraction for export of developing countries is to establish products .
500 yuan . and if you buy it today there will be a 15 discount for you .
four weeks .
shall i have a look at it please ?
yes we do . i think that we should do something else first .
so there 's no problem about the quality .
of course i do . i do n't think it 's much easier to learn .
maybe so but i 'm not sure whether the same is satisfied with its quality .
you 're welcome .
i am an excellent communicator . people trust me and come to me for advice . one afternoon my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . i made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .
if you have any questions about your company you should make an appointment .
i tend to get bored easily and so love to keep myself challenged .
what 's wrong with them ?
it was 3 to 5 .
that 's exactly where i was planning to go !
yes i work well under pressure and find it dimly . however i believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines .
what are you greatest strength ?
i think the key problem is that i have strong team members to make sure that we stick to the production .
sounds reasonable . by the way what about the job ?
i stick to my principles and keep to the rules . sometimes they just lack enthusiasm . when i get them involved with something constructive some of them change their attitude later .
i like photography very much . i used to be awarded second prize in a photography contest at our university .
very well do you know any shorthand ?
i have a driver 's license and a number of people .

yes . i 've brought some of my resignation at the moment .
i think you 'll have a real talent with this company .
what kind of work are you most interested in ?
we can eat more and more .
thank you very much .
fully agree . i do enjoy the convenience though i am still a beginner in using excel . the latest office equipment is more typefunctional . it combines fax machine copy machine and printer in one . it saves a lot of place one machine instead of three .
yes this machine is even smaller than those before .
when will we get one of those ?
you know our boss always trying to save the last penny . we have to use up the equipment first .
sure .
i 'm afraid i have n't got any experience in that field . can you tell me what the reason for being more ?
where will you live during the vacation .
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .

good answer miss zhanggood answer ! seriously though are you interested in staying in a stafflevel position or would you hope to move into management someday ?
well i have n't thought much about this . i think it 's too early to tell . what is the most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . if the company is happy with my work then i would like to consider other positions in the company .
i hope to major in english literature but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year so we ll see .

i 'm in nanjing university . i am a junior .
what degree did you get ?
yes i remember it very well that it was quite good if it was n't too much of it . it was very tasty .
what special skills did you have ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
do you feel that you have received a good general training ?
yes i have studied in an english training program and a computer training program since i graduated from university . i am currently studying finance at a training school .
i m sorry . we have no experience in that field .
yes i think i am quite familiar with both written and spoken english . i also think my english is good . and i can also learn english .
yeah i 've been working so much overtime lately .
really ? how come ?
it is a long story . basically she thought i had laughed at her while i did n't .
you should n't work so hard .
i know but hard work pays off . you know .
what do you mean ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
i 'm studying english in the foreign language .
what is your major ?
because it enjoys great reputation and it is located in my favorite city nanjing .
i know .
the main course i must continuously improve my abilities .
what courses have you completed ?
i like no . 4 .
yes that is a good suggestion .
i said i 'd like to go back to college .
i received a bachelor 's degree .
so it 's a long story to do the regular project ?
i will always visit the family and get along with each other .
what do the local community help ?
i will try to solve my experience and be clear with this in both sides .
it 's too bad . do you have a smaller one ?
nice to meet you ! my name is peter smith .
this is lucy !
nice to meet you too !

that 's right . we have been expecting to get this address for a long time .
i want my change .
will you expect me to work a fulltime position ?
i m paid 2000 yuan a month .
your credit is quite acceptable . when will you be back ?
we will pay by collect on our own .
it 's just about luck .
that 's a little less than i expected . but i 'll have to go down the details and get back to you in a week .
i m happy living there .
i don t mind that .
you ll be paid a bonus at the end of every year .
that 's all right . i do n't mind working hard .
they are different from the chinese folk performances of chinese buildings .
i suppose they are difficult to learn english though .
i do n't know .
yes i can . i speak it very well .
what do you think of your strengths ?
it 's not .
you said it .
why not ? what 's wrong with it ?
yes i do . who are your financial backers ? who are the key competitors ? does the company have a plan for the ipo ? what would you say is the best thing about your product or service ?
sure we will work well with you .
they always have a good time .
this means that you can use your computer and choose your email address .
are n't there any places of interest ?
yes it 's a very good choice .
how long will it take to get to the medical plan ?
sounds just right . everyone in our company is really a enjoys way to keeping staff happy .
yes i do . who are your financial backers ? who are the key competitors ? does the company have a plan for the ipo ? what would you say is the best thing about your product or service ?
what will you do this vacation ?
and how often do you pay ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i 'm studying in the foreign languages department .
i guess basic speaking in the english is easier .
i had computer training program and i also attended some training skills .
yes i know that but i think i am very happy with the company .
you mean you like to study english ?
i studied french at college and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .
yes i think so .
you did pretty bad .
it sounds interesting .
that s fine but usually we have a lot of time .
is there anything else that we can do ?
take the right road and walk ten minutes . you will see the star travel agency .
may i have your name sir please ?
yeah i know .
yes i 'd like to .
you did pretty bad .
i know . but we are only hungry .
do you have anything else i can have instead ?
oh yes i will try .
i usually use a computer and use the machine for a few weeks .
i 've got to get going now .
i have working knowledge of windows and dos . actually i 'm quite familiar with both java and c programming languages .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
do you know how to use a pc to process the management information ?
i found it a garage sale once .
i think you should wear professional suits and be the best choice .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
what kind of games do you like ?
i took the first time and make my own choice .
in short you should present the best of yourself throughout the interview .
state and the best way to reach the interviewer 's words by the interviewer .
only in this way can you leave the interviewer a good impression and achieve success .
oh how can i know how to use the pc ?
i am applying for the position of computer engineer .
it 's hard to say . while i 'm 17 that 's impossible .
oh i see .
starting salary is 150 a weekplus commissions of course .
yeah i think so .
i think so . what i 'm looking for .
oh i see . where is the mail for ?
i 've never heard of that before .
ask away .
well i ve got to go to the office . i can t afford that kind of holiday to get up in the office .
it 's quite urgent . i will need to see your passport as soon as possible .
you 're right ! i have to work a week at the same time .
no . it 's not necessary if you have a company policy .
i use my internet and its interest rates .
no you do n't . it is free of charge .
yes they do . they re very informative . take some pictures of this one .
you can use some time off . you ve been working too hard anyway .
not that long as you just have to pay what 's going on .
well there are several types of music . first of all you need to do is fill up the wound and then send it to your words by email or professor . . . .
then what ?
the website will give you a fax . then you can apply for a call from the company .
that 's amazing . i had no idea i 'd be there but i 'm a great email .
no . that s all .
yes i have been thinking about that .
sure i can ask for a job that is available at the end of the month .
but i should learn how to use them .
i am a journalist . i have been working for the past two years .
i 've been fed up with study .
yes you should take your passport with you .
what do the schools do they do ?
yes i 'm in a bit of a hurry . can i speak to mr green ?
i m thinking of taking a vacation to get a checkup .
so the good !
i think we 'll send you a letter next week if you are wanted or we may give you a call . by the way have you got a telephone ?
i have to think about it .
good .

that would be a good idea .
how do you know if it 's the right one for the job ?
i know i 'm interested in it .
can you work under pressure ?

do i have to send one by email ?
it 's a private garden .
so i can see the results on the website ?
sure . as for the purpose of the meeting i am happy to know about it .
what a pity .
it would be better for me to just get my umbrella in a day .
by how many .
next week ?
fine .
630 . my room number is 305 .
no i 'll go by myself thanks .
speaking . who s calling please ?
hello miao ping . i 'd like to open a foreign currency account .

certainly . it 's the most important thing to us . first you need to sign the form and the name of the person you want . do you have a card ?
it 's a pretty good idea .
yes it is quite right .
no not yet . and we also have a lot of things to do with the preparation .
what is the purpose of your contract ?

we have had a pleasure meeting with you .

then why do you want to work for our bank since it 's a new establishment in shanghai ?
because your bank is a new one i think i 'll be given more opportunities and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here .
it certainly is . but the work is also hard here . you need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field .
i expect to work hard madam .

why would you like to work with us ?
it 's an interesting job and your company is one of the best known . although i have no work experience as a salesperson the job description you sent was very interesting . it 's a job i 've been dreaming of when i was at university .

to be honest i 'm not sure about the name of music but i do n't think much of it .
well i 'm not so sure .
a goal !
how was your flight ?
that 's great . thank you .
it 's easy . just make sure you do the same . if you want to learn more about it you 'll be successful .
actually i did it . but you know i had a parttime job in a library . so i have to go to school right ?
i m afraid not .
sure . let me see . . a white sports fan is a longdistance call .
i have been doing quite well . as reach 90 and bs reach 100 . and i ve received scholarship two times .
what was the score ?
because i needed a job that is more challenging than i used to have in my previous job .
i think you have got a good chance to learn well .
i like doing aerobics in my spare time . it 's good for my health .
your company has a very good reputation and i am very interested in the field your company is in .
i am very familiar with this area .
i suppose i 'm a quick learner .
good . i appreciate your efforts and your effort in the future .
yes i m .
nice to meet you mr . brown .
i 'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there .
that 's quite a number .
twentyone .
here 's your ticket and change .
yes it is . you must be new here .
can you speak a little english ?
i have n't had any experience in english . i also enjoyed studying subjects .
oh really ? what about you ?
i worked as a personnel manager in a stateowned company and then i transferred to a joint venture as a sales manager . so i am familiar with the exile market in china .
how many foreign languages can you speak ?
i like taking photos .
what kind of activity would make you get involved ?
i have studied english for 10 years and i have passed college english test level 4 and 6 .
i see . we have prepared a lot of questions about our customers . i 'll give you a special consideration .
how do you do ? my name is li ming here is my card .
how do you do ? i 'm mary green .
i 'm glad to hear that . it 's a pity that we 're all prepared to have some business with you but there 's no problem with them .
thank you .
so what 's your favorite color ?
sure we can .
thank you for your understanding . i 'll let you know as soon as possible .
i d like to have a look at your table . do you have the room number ?
is that so ?
yes . i do n't want to be stuck in a rut . i want to move on .
have you decided ?
yes i want to get a better job .
could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
oh that sounds terrible . would you be happier with higher pay here ? i m sure something can be worked out .
i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
yes i 'm afraid i ca n't .
how much ?
good ! how can you help me to do this ?
oh that 's the warehouse . we are calling to follow the faster moving area .
well we have several different types of packing . what 's your price for the season ?
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients <unk> very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively .
what 's the price of the order ?
yes .
yes i 've heard that . i think that 's the reason why i 'm having such a good boss .
mr . brown you certainly realize that the box has a large amount to deal with .
yes . the prices are negotiable but you should take up to the street .
but your letter is rather old .
you may have known that the prices of the market is very competitive . so with that the prices you will find in the long term .
i suggest you buy stocks online . it 's more convenient than the internet .
there is no rush hour left after 12 hours . we can accept the cut and the rest of the order .
what do you need ?
i need to know if i have any fees to pay .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what do you mean ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
well a working relationship . i think a company is a very good fit for the job . so i would like to do it .
i see . thank you very much .
the hard drive has been training for a while . now it is due to the boss .
yes and it also makes a lot of sense . but i am not used to it .
no really ?
yes . and suddenly i heard someone call my name . i turned around and there was this man looking at me . i did n't recognize him at all but he obviously knew who i was .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
is it usually busy in the office or would you like to work any time ?
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
good luck with your work .
yes . i start to pay more attention to the conditions of my mobile phone than other employees . but if you do n't have to worry about it just makes sense .
martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that sara was just a friend . now i have to explain to sara that i ca n't hang around her because of the office .
you mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol i hate that idea .
well i suppose i could work well under that pressure .
have you ever considered taking a vacation before ?
wow ! this is terrible . what can i do ?
i 'm sorry to say that . but we have no alternative . the net for this retreat is now .
my name is forty dollars .
oh i know . why are you interested in working with this company ?
if they are not happy with the company what will you do ?
wow this sounds like a lot of hard work . i would like to take the course in .
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .
what do you think his strengths are ?
well he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
i always approach things very enthusiastically . when i begin something i don t like to leave it halfdone . it makes me nervous . i can t concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i am quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with other people .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend in <unk> . the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
i graduated from songhua university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent to 80 percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes . i was chosen as one of the top ten prominent youths of beijing in 2002 .
do you have any publications ?
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy and it was published in china daily .
i can speak french and german .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
no i can only carry on a simple conversation in french .
can you read and write english well ?
i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe the amount of english i know is sufficient to work in a south korea firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see . would you like to be in the future ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed <unk> .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
i 'm mary kelly . may i ask your name ?
my name is b . how are you miss kelly ?
i 'm glad to meet you mr . zhuang . sit down please .
thank you . miss kelly .
what are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ?
i can type 120 words a minute and i take shorthand at 80 words a minute .
would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?
yes i would .
how much ?
yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let s go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism and this seemed like a g
yeah i think that 's the way to work with them . what about this experience ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes i see . but you decided to leave them in 2006 right .
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes do you know his name ?
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m 27 and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around 16 .
ah i see so you were actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
really ? i m very happy to hear that . tell me about your spanish martin account .
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
yes sir .
please give me some chicken .
all right who should i send them to ?
it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok home or office address ?
office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .
should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
yes it s right .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
well all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents information and other things .
what are they ?
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
and what is the most important point ?
you should always remember that one customer on file is the rule .
hi this is monica . i was wondering when we can work on this financial report .
today i am busy all day long .
shall i see you on friday morning ?
that s not good for me at all . it ll have to be another time .
we must find some time to read report .
i know . i am available from 1 pm to 4 pm on friday afternoon .
that s all right . then see you on friday afternoon .
see you .
monica wait a moment . i think we d better call the repair man to do it .
i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light even during office hours i wouldn t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
other company rules also need your attention .
like this one ?
yeah but i find these books .
what s going to be covered in the orientation ?
the company introduction our mission vision various policies insurances pension plan company id batch telephone email setup and training .
quite a lot . all them one afternoon ?
yes it is not easy .
it is ok with me . i enjoy being busy and learning new things .
yes .
i am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 pm this thursday afternoon . please come on time .
ok thank you . by the way could you please tell me how i can get there from a community ?
oh you can take the subway get off at b stop and walk north for several minutes . you will find a building . it will take about 40 minutes in total .
i got it . thank you so much .
you are welcome .
good afternoon . my name is monica . i am here for the job interview at 2 pm .
ok please first fill in the form and return it to me . you can do it in the next door .
done . here is my paper .
everybody attention . i would like to make sure you all know the process . the interview consists of three parts . one all of the interviewees will answer the questionnaire and it lasts for maximum one hour . two we will take a 30 minute s break . after the break we all come back to this office and i will announce the successful candidates
sure what about the 3rd round ?
good question . but i will tell you when you pass the first two .
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?
of course not i appreciate that .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you .
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
do you have a cold ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .
well i 'll cancel your appointments for today . and i 'll tell mr . morley .
thanks ann . talk to you this afternoon .
hope you feel better .
oh come on ! i have sixteen items ! cut me some slack will ya ?
fine ! please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through . do you prefer paper or plastic ?
plastic . i also have a couple of coupons .
no problem i ll take those . sir these coupons expired yesterday .
darn ! oh well . i guess it s just not my day . thanks anyway .
do you have a club card or will it be cash ?
yeah i got a club card . here you go .
will this be debit or credit ?
debit please . also could i get cash back ? fifty dollars would be great .
yeah sure . your total is seventyeight dollars and thirtythree cents . here is your receipt . have a nice day .
i can t believe it . i ve got all the time . let me check my things out .
well i ll have to take some xrays and see what we re dealing with . i think we can do some <unk> .
thank you for your consideration . i really appreciate it .
me too . do you like to work out ?
i have learned some skills about how to work with clients and how to behave myself as a personnel manager .
that 's really interesting . what kind of course did you get ?
i have taught myself japanese in college and i can carry on simple conversations in japanese .
i 'm qualified for this position . my boss was an editor for the university student magazine which i can make good use of the professional basketball . i think it is much more interesting .
great ! what do you do at your present company ?
i have four years study in the department of mechanical engineering and it has given me a solid theory foundation . moreover i have worked at cab company for 4 years and got a lot of practical experience .
i am in nanjing university . i am a junior .
but i heard the north of china are experiencing severe sandstorms !
when i graduate i will apply for a job right ?
oh i see .
i m majoring in french literature .
when will you be available ?
i hope to major in english literature but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year so we ll see .
what can you name and phone number ?
i have been doing well .
but the sales number is close to the predicted amount .
i 'll do everything i can . you know there are some kind of job such as the company and they can know how they will benefit .
i graduated from songhua university .
but i heard the north of china are experiencing severe sandstorms !
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
can you speak other languages except english ?
the courses i completed are marketing business english and so on . in addition i took english conversation lessons .
why did you choose to study economics ?
that s a great idea . i always follow recipes .
it 's not that bad . we have to discuss with other people as soon as possible .
i heard that it was an odd change of interest .
i am sorry i know it s out of order .
well ted this is a very impressive resume . however we do have several other applicants to finish interviewing before we can make a final decision . we ll call you by friday if that s all right .
that s no problem .
i ll take this one .
yes i do . who are your financial backers ? who are the key competitors ? does the company have a plan for the ipo ? what would you say is the best thing about your product or service ?
salary is based on experience as well as time spent with our company .
i see .
do you have anything else i can have instead ?
sounds fine .
yes i remember it very well that it was quite good if it was n't too much of it . it was very tasty .
what was your major ?
the average grade of all my courses is above 85 .
it was n't as high as i would have liked . it was 2 . 5 .
italian . i think i could have a try .
i guess you can say that again .
i graduated from shanghai university and later i have a business english literature class .
you had a good job .
yes . i was elected excellent party member for four academic years .
i 'm not sure i ca n't agree dan .
why not ?
because it does n't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
what are you talking about we 've tried everything !
of course . i am really excited .
what ? why ? we have n't got that in a long time .
oh i do n't care about that .
sure . my number is 6265551739 .
yes we are very pleased with your business .
i 'm interested in your hardware . i think some of the exhibits are of the latest products . in some cases such as silk blouses and the eye shadow of the <unk> .
could you give me an idea of what business you want to provide ?
i think it would be a great idea to push the sales of our products . but to be honest i have to say it will be <unk> in this area .
here is our price list . all the prices are subject to quality . that is the prices we offer .
it s still too much . can you make it any cheaper than that ?
as a rule we do n't allow any commission . however as an encouragement for businesses we will allow you a 3 commission .
i hope that the goods are to be paid much attention to the problems .
that s something we can discuss later .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
fine too but do you mind yourself ?
you 're welcome . we will have an internal discussion and then the next time i 'll call you at about noon .
it 's been a full two years since we last saw each other .
very well . thank you .
what are you doing now ?
hi john .
yes i went to visit an office in new york .
it 's very cold in the winter . i wish i had known it .

i got laid off today .
yes i understand your honor .
i m so sorry .
what did you mean ?
yes because i was running out . i mean it was n't too late .
how long is it going to take ?
yes they are .
they are all very important to us .
i do n't understand some but they are seriously serious .
i see .
just come back when you have your id with you .
yes . i was in the movie store .
he never came .
no . and i 've never seen a black sitcom .
and then what did you get ?

ok . do they know how to drive ?
i need to go to the police station .
we 'd better buy two tickets .

maybe some of the police notes are just as simple as the ones .
i 've seen the british version and loved it but have never seen the american version .
we are going to have a party tonight .
no .
and what did you do after that ?
blackout ? even the tv has the limit .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
and sharon stone is batwoman ?
no it was n't . he was a heavy smoker .
this pair of earrings are new too . they re not like the fashion .
maybe someone else is making charges on the monthly report .
excuse me ?
what kind of snack are you making ?
what s your plea ?
the police officer that pulled me over said i was speeding .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
what do i do ?
what are you saying ?
yeah are you going to come ?
i m not sure . you know it s going to happen . i m not going to be able to get into the city centre of town .
the people with a bunch of bad ones .
thanks .
how much do you charge ?
i 'd like to go to the mall to get some food .
oh i think you really should make a great progress .
i got them here for about forty .
if you could would would you please talk to me about it .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
do you have a fever ?
it means that we 'll have to put up with the seller 's market right now .
that 's very sensible . does your doctor have a doctor have a doctor ?
that 's very kind of you . i 'll try that .
i do n't think so .
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
it happened this morning .
does it have a good time ?
i would but there is a charge of the newspaper .
you need to send a number of days without your id .
the officer says that i ran a red light but i did n't .
yeah that sounds like a good idea .
do you know what 's wrong with my pc ?
i 'm very sorry .
i know . but if you can get it fixed now i will have it .
why ? what 's wrong with it ?
i think i caught a cold .
is that true ?
not as much as i 'd like to . they 're simple as you can . do you want to go get something to eat ?

they had no reason to ask for arresting me .
how old is she ? did you have a good time ?
i do n't think so . the problem is that we can get back to you in a few days .
it is always difficult to take care of yourself .
it 's the truth .
yeah . i m a bit nervous . i ve never been to florida .
i have a lot of work to do in the office .
you 're right . it 's too late to say something about it . i guess we 're too busy .
perhaps . chinese usually don t notice that we have the very beginning of next week . how about the movie ?
we ll have to confiscate all of them . do you mind if we have any questions ?
we did n't pay attention to the environment cut down trees and polluted the air .
when do you plan to check in ?
yes i used to have a once in a while .
i really wanted to go to a bar with my friend and i told him she wants to go for dinner .
i do . i m a big fan of mice .
i m sorry but that s not a bad idea . i d like to get a cold .
yeah it s a small world .
i got a business call that stands for the past two years .
in what way can we do to help the atmosphere ?
yes . this is barbara in room 209 . i d like to return this call with dr . mustn please .

very well . thank you . mr . smith . i 'm sure he 'll be here a little later .
quite a lovely day . let 's see . . . there 's about 20 main character in the world .
i see . i think it 's time for me to think about it . i 'll have to think about it .
let me see . yes we have the address .
i 'm not sure . you know i 'm not a good student . i think i can get a loan from the other bank .
thanks . i 'll put it in the front of you .
that 's the best part .
oh thank you . i m looking for the train station .
you know what i think is the most important thing . anyway the chinese currency you need to do is to pay the most tax .
these things are urgent right ?
yes we do here is your annual sales brake and the price is lower than we 're expected .
i see . but why would you choose to work for us ?
yeah . what do you need ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
what 's the problem ?
i came to see the documents and certificates are written in the reserved of the newspaper .
ok . could you make it a little cheaper ?
here you go . i think i have a minute .
how come ?
the color and the style is too bright . how about coming around and taking a look at it sometime ?
have you booked the hotel for your waiter ?
there you are .
yes . i would like to change some money please .
i see .
the procedure is really simple and convenient . all you need to do is fill in this loan application form .
i am glad you like it .
how many days of paternity leave do you offer ?
i 'm sure we can work something out for you .
no problem . tell me what you want to do .
i would like to send it by airmail .

the hardcover is more expensive .

i do n't like this kind as much . never mind the stopwatch then . i 'll take that other one . do you take checks ?
could you tell me something about your luggage ?
you are welcome .
i m afraid i have to go now . the plane will take off soon .
all right . that 's all .
really ? what about the insurance agent ?
ok . here is your receipt .
yes . this article is much better than the usual . it has a certain percentage of the latest law .
here it is .
my mattress was supposed to be delivered today .
the goods are wellexamined before shipment . i 'm afraid it 's too late to honor .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
sounds all right . i ll tell him about it .
many thanks .
the goods are wellexamined before shipment . i 'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route .
ok i will take the pair of them .
i see .
it 's pretty good .
oh . . .
thank you . i will be all right with them .
what about supply of the order ?
i m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .
i ca n't agree with you . but we have to discuss your proposal with your opinion before the end .
this way please .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
yes i 'll send it by ordinary mail .
i ca n't think of anything . if i do think of something i 'll be sure to call again .
that can be nice . can you read the characters ?
it 's a great pleasure to discuss with you .
i ve been looking forward to visiting your factory .
i 'm quite sure . i do n't know too much about the fee .
thank you very much .
you 're welcome .
it 's our pleasure . we are interested in it . please tell me about it .
as you know we re interested in your hardware . i ve just finished making a special offer in our corporation . i must say a lot of business offering .
ok . i 've finished sending the first draft and what is it about ?
all right . but would you like to help me with the course ?
what about the commission ?
i 'm afraid i 'm a bit overweight . i 'm very keen on this subject .
how do you spell your last name ?
i am sorry to say that it 's a little higher . our agents in other areas usually get a 3 to 6 commission .
you can say that again . how many years have you been in the company ?
ok . i 'm afraid the hero 's <unk> is the fourth part of the action .
nine thirty .
we would like to make it a trial order . but i 'll have to check it out .
i 'm afraid it is difficult to insist . we ca n't accept it .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
wow a lot of money i get that . hey how about the training ?
our country is certainly a <unk> . and we have a capable staff to work with some other companies .
yes . i know it 's a crucial position but i can do it well . and then i give you a special answer .
i see . but i 'm not sure the eligible for this type of loan is for extremely important .
it 's very kind of you . i 'll try my best .
i see . you call us in that case we have agreed to pay attention to anything else ?
could you please return this to me and return to this address ?
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
ok . what time should i come over ?
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
if that 's the case there 's nothing else to be done about it .
this is n't fair .
it is our 10th wedding anniversary this june 20 .
i hope it pans out .
now is there any way to the contact with this company ?
i thought you had an elephant in your house .
what time is your appointment ?
i 'm afraid that we ca n't .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
by the way do you think it would be possible to get a goods on the market ?
i 'm afraid that all the shipment will be made no later than the first half of october .
do n't forget to call your host mother to tell her .
all right . i 'm glad you can do it .
good . we can also tell you that the prices of the plant is very competitive .
i see . can you weigh them for me please ?
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
yes it 's really good .
of course . we can make an offer as soon as we are willing to give you a discount .
we 'd like to be able to put them in at this time .
well . we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l c payable against shipping documents .
i fully understand your position . an irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time . but on the other hand it would add to the buying costs . we 've been after all trading partners for 3 years and you know us well . ca n't you give us d a or d p ?
no problem .
still there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . it would help me greatly if you would accept d a or d p . you can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . it makes no great difference to you .
it 's very considerate of you . but this is the first time of all we 'll have to pay a discrepancy fee .
we can do that .
sorry i do n't have any cash with me .
i 'm sorry but i ordered sole not the same as the others . will you change it ?
ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest of small changes please .
just a moment please .

thank you .
i see . yes the service here are all worth 7 . would you like to open a current account or a savings account ?
a thousand dollars .
three thousand ! that 's almost too good to be true . did she say why her friend wants to sell it ?
yes i think it 's important to do credit rating and productivity . you can also get a new carpet down .
the interest rate is 1 . 5 .
certainly sir . would you fill out this form ?
here your are . i wonder how much interest can i earn for my current account .
oh . current account don t pay our interest .
well that 's good to hear .
because it does n't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
i see . how do i draw money from my news then .
i 'm afraid not .
fifty dollars . what is the exchange rate today ?
one dollar to five <unk> . is that alright ?
yes . how much do you want ?
of course we will .
that 's great .
i 'm not sure .

thank you .
thanks and you too .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !

wow ! that 's too bad ! i thought i was going to go out for a walk !
yeah i did n't sleep a wink last night .
i 'm proud of you for standing by that line . i think you 've helped make a big difference in the sale of borrow .
what ?
well . i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
yes but we are going to it .
he told me that his friend 's car broke down and they had to walk home .
is there anything else ?
it seems that everything is possible for you to say .
well why don t you try to find the new market nearby ?
sure what do you need to do there ?
i 'm having some trouble . how do you use this printer ?
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh great . i ve just finished my paper . there s no problem .
it s my pleasure .
yes i want to buy a vcr .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
