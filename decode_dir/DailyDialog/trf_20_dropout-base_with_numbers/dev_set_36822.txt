i 'm very sorry sir .

i know . but i prefer playing tennis .
i never go to school for a gym .
what do you mostly do during your workout ?
well i swim and run every day but i 'm not good at it .
in that case you want to work with less weight . you can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . five kilo weights should be enough . now it s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .
about three times a week if i can .
i would like to have my hair cut .
ok . if you want to buy now you will enjoy it .
sure .
i mean you could n't give it up !
the best is to be attractive and cheap .
yes it 's a little large . the windows and the icebox are in good order and the plumbing is ok too .
i 've been wash and will get it for you .
the small rooms and the small but the small stove are quite small .
so will i .

he 's a bit handsome . he s very considerate .
i like the styte but i do n't think the one fits me well . could you give me a 20 discount ?

what kind of benefit are you interested in ?
here is your receipt . have a nice day .
they are 168 .
what color do you like ?
he said he would be able to make it back for the week .
i 've been thinking about visiting my friend . thank you .

i think i 'll go and find a quiet one .
yes it was the best choice for me .
that 's what we 're looking for .
i 'm a big fan of snoop dog .
oh ! that 's nice .
sure . i 'm looking for a place to put on the right hand side of the building .
yeah . i got it .
i 'm sorry but i do n't know how to keep it .
i mean he 's a lot like he 's no special . he 's so talented . he can become a member of the popular and he 's so he always so he always sold a lot of people in the world .

i do n't believe it . how much is it ?
yes we have several kinds of stamps .
oh that 's ok .
here you are .
i 'd like to change some money .

in that case please be seated .
ok .
yes . i 'd like to have one please .
the doctor has sent them to us by thursday morning . in fact i have to work today .
well if you like the soup you just need to have a look .
it 's a recruiting agency which specializes in introducing talented people to companies and businesses .
i think i 'll try chinese table for the most .
okay . i 'll get it .
it feels all right . but if it were a darker color i 'd like it better . this seems too light for winter . do you think you could get me one ?
i 'm so sorry to hear that .

i know . i will take it .
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
that s all .
you mean you can look through the internet ?

let me check it out .
it could have been a great idea to have a look at it .
yes . i do n't have to worry about them .
where is it ?
how long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?
sure that would be wonderful . i can also recommend the apartment for you .
it would probably be very expensive .
sure . that means we can offer you a room for up .
well maybe you should try to find out about it .
i have to work this tuesday .
where is it ?
it is . it s very easy to get . the government has gone through these exports . they are very friendly to each other .

we have red wine and white wine .
that sounds good . i 'll take two bowls of shrimp rolls .
that 's great . i 'm afraid i ca n't .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to do ?
you should take the no . 2 bus .
is that right ?
that 's a great idea . i love it .
i know . i ca n't wait to see the guys who are n't so bad .
ok . i 'll bring it over .
well i like the room . i 'm not sure i 'll have it .

you are really good . the quality of the skin and the color is so soft .
no problem .
i 'm afraid there 's nothing wrong with your connection .

what would you like ?
i want to see the menu . would you please bring me some flowers ?
how would you like your steak rare medium or welldone ?

i just got a job offer from dell .
yes i think so . i bought it four months ago .
i 'm sure you 'll love this .
i have to find it . you know i 'm too nervous .
ok . how about this one ? it 's our biggest 16 in diameter .
that 's a good idea . but it must be worth it .
i do n't like it .
well it depends on the price of the car . it is a very expensive car .
i 'm afraid not . the price is too high .
the price of cpu is 260 dollars .
that s correct !
you 're welcome .
i do n't know what to say .
i 'm sorry but our car is fully furnished .
i know it is not the cheapest on the market . but if you take the quality factor into consideration you will find your company will benefit in the long term . this device is built in with the most advanced technology . every aspect has reached the international standard . it is a worthwhile investment .
no sir . we 've got some great clothes in thousand yuan .
i think you should tell me about your educational background .

i 'm afraid i ca n't make it .

maybe just a few days ?
i guess i 'll stay here until the baby 's baby .

they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .

maybe . but i want to get one .
maybe i should try a thai massage too .
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try

sure . i d love to . you re welcome .
is there any difference ?
i think i 'll try the food .
i ll come back to the wine .
yes it is . but i 'm not so sure .
that 's great . i love seafood very much .
well here you are .
i think you could say that .
well since you 're in the student government it 's a big department store to store it it is in the cabinet .
you 're too early to make the offer .
oh yes it s just a few minutes walk . turn left at the traffic light and you ll see it .
i am afraid i have to go now . the traffic is not heavy today . the traffic is too late .
my name is zu ping .
ok .
i think it s the worst thing i ve ever tried .
i don t know .
yes . i think it 's much more charming than the cars .
what happened ?
oh how awful ! can you wait a second ? i ca n't wait to see it .
i don t think so .
i want to see the menu . would you please bring me a cup of coffee ?
no no no no no . i 'm afraid i do n't have any .
what happened ?
i m not sure .
i think that s a bunch of nonsense . it s better that we should do something else .
i know . he did n't make a mistake .
let s go to that store to buy some money .
if the traffic is bad all that bad weather is so bad .
i think so . it s a nice ride .
what happened ?
what kind of apartment are you looking for ?
i like this fact . i ran into the u . s . a . today .
i know . i m going to the library . i m sorry . there s one downstairs .
i see . it 's a long time to go . the security door is so firm that the place is fully furnished .
and the rent includes utilities .
i see .
i know . can i put it on your way to the office ?
good idea .
where to ?
beijing university .
is it furnished ?
i m afraid i have to be late .
sure . then i 'll be there .
that 's very kind of you . we do n't have to work today . we are going to have to get a class .
i 'll do my best .
here 's twenty dollars .
well i 've only done a lot of business for my company . i think you 'll have a good time .
oh i see .
ok . here you are .
here you are .
where to sir ?
well the new one .
ok . how much is the fare please ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't .
you have to pay ten cents a copy .
here is your change .
it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
that 's true .
i 'm sorry but i ordered sole not the same as the others . will you change it ?
what is the problem ?
thank you .
hi . it s tony calling from the dentist s office . is lily there ?
yes . how can i help you ?
thank you . this is your key . you need to fill out this form please .
yes i am . what can i do for you ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't smoke here .
that 's a good idea .
what 's the time ?
yes we are very happy with your decision .
that 's fantastic ! i like the fact that i 'm going to take a look at it .
i know . well if you re lucky you might have to wait for a few minutes . it 's the last thing i can do .
i would like to live in a higher neighborhood but i am not sure about the city .
an international one ? i have never heard of that before . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . i 'll call the taxi .
ok . thank you .
yes it is .
how much does it cost ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first or at the room ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
i would like to make a specific inquiry to our company .
sorry he 's out .
when do you expect him back ?
i would like to leave a message to mr . johnson .
yes please tell him i called and ask him to return my call .
ok .
ok . thank you .
you can check out university bulletin boards .
yes of course . you can also go to the bank and learn some useful skill in this process .
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
i was thinking about seeing the apartment ads .
that 's a little more than i wanted to pay . can you tell me what the rate is ?
i know it is . but i 'm not sure about it .
i m not sure i agree with you . if you want to live in a department it would be more convenient for you to pay for the products .
i am so glad i did n't notice the way .
i agree with you in this way . but i think the train is better for me to go .
i usually do housework in mornings . i go shopping occasionally . i like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket .
do you always go to work on night or would you prefer to go shopping ?
i know . i want to go to the university flea market right now .
where did he go ?
i went to the library on the fifth floor .
i do n't know .
you are right . i guess i 'll be a great mother to have a child like you .
yeah you are right . he is really a hard working student .
well i 'm not sure . i 'll try my best to take the course again .
that 's a good idea . let 's go to school .
it 's more violent than tv .
hi linda . i m calling to confirm the date of the next interview .
wow ! it s great to see you !
it 's all coming up . i should be there some time .
i 'm very well thank you .
i 've been working too .
oh that 's great ! it 's all together !
thank you . actually i could not believe it at first . you know there 're so many outstanding people in our company . many of them are qualified to fill that position .
well i am really happy to hear that .
what time does the next showing of forrest gump begin ?
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
for two years .
it seems that a lot of people have to do as part of the company .
she 's pretty easy to get along with . she listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .
what is your strongest trait ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .
that 's not a problem . he used to be a famous singer in the future .
what 's the matter ?
ok .
i 'll come back to china tonight .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
no we have n't decided yet . we are hoping to move our car in with you .
well i m not sure . we ve just been here for quite a few years . well i m looking for a position to put and we ll consider it for a lot of money .
come on let me show you the house . here you are . we ve got plenty of room . let s see . there are the ingredients here . we have a high power of motor . we ve got you a few shirts . would you like to choose some ?
you can take a break from the rest of your extra space for me . i can put you down for a few minutes .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
i am looking for a small room .
how long does it take you to get that ?
you certainly have to ! you can t take me to that cafe for you and i ll just put my car away .
i know ! it s an amazing growth opportunity ! they re not going to get a bachelor party this time !
what 's the price of the gas ?
ok ! we ve got a lot of time before we go to the library . it s a good exercise and it s fun !
i guess i 'm lending them to you . . .
i can never wait to play the piano .
i m afraid there s nothing i can do .
yes . i m here to fix your pipes .
what s your computer ?
i m fine . i ll take a picture of the pamphlet .
what s your camera ?
right . well i see . so that i can get the contract ready by the end of the week .
i 'm afraid you ca n't . it 's a dutyfree shop .
it is very nice and easy .
so how much do you spend ?
you too .
i d like to try an outlet .
so you 're saying that you 're from america ?
i d like to try that .
what is the difference between the two ?
i 'm not sure . but i want to have a try .
it s a bit of a problem .
that s right .
i would like to have it wrapped for you .
no problem at all .
i need to make a deposit .
the ground beef is 2 . 48 a pound .
that s fine .
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .

no that 's all . thanks .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
it s a very good idea to have you with those meat .
okay . i ll take your word for it .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . i ll just stay in bed for that .
i want to buy some flowers .
do you have any special request ?
it is the best season for a stewardess to have a free facial and then go to mrs . smith .
you re right . this is a very elegant design .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
well this is a dozen things i m afraid . they re not too expensive to get a 3 or 3 percent discount .
i don t think i m ready to get a good deal .
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i guess i could t find out if there is a table available .
you can do a pet that we have a dog .
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old !
i have no idea what you are talking about .
i mean it s not the same as the car .
how much does this cost ? i do n't know how much this is going to cost . i want to spend a fortune on a tour .
sir the gym is free to guests .
i have no idea what you are talking about .
i m not too nervous ! i just want to hear the perfect lighting in this car . do you know how to use this ?
i know . ok i know . i am ready to wash my hair and wash clothes for wash clothes .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
just make it to your side and then turn right . wait for a moment . . . quick !
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set .
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wish i had n't chosen this job .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
that 's true . i never heard of that . the funniest thing is that i never even think of a stage that is that the thing that is in china . a bunch of people do n't mind .
i know i 'm a good student . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
oh i 'm not sure . let 's try .
i think i will try to find the local one .
you 're not going to have to . i 'm not going to be late for dinner .
no really . i 've been thinking about that .
i will . thanks for your advice .
are you sure you 're taking the class on your left ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you .
but i ca n't believe it .
i 'd like to look at some of your products .
do you have your library card with you ?
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well you can still play a lot of website using computers like you can play games surf the net or play games get into your computer . do you have a private email ?
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
you re not nervous ?
awesome !
yes . but i need a report to your boss .
it s true . i m going to get a car run .
it s a chilly day folks so don t forget your coats ! what about tomorrow kenny ?
i am glad it did n't get so bad !
good news !
it would cost between 2 and 10 dollars more per square yard .
sure . i think it 's great ! i can recommend you some for you . it 's the latest fashion . you can also cut the main thing you have in mind when you try it .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! i 'll take it . oh no i 'm a little short . did you bring your credit card ?
i m thinking about buying it today .
i like the color and the material is good quality . it s bright and the material is good .
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
what size do you wear ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks for reminding me . i had forgotten to show you how to pay for it .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
you 're right .
i 'm afraid not . the tour will have to be a lot of people .
i know what you mean . i 'd rather be cold than hot .
you 're right . the view is spectacular .
it s a very good idea to have a grand home .
you mean we can climb the stairs to the top of that .
i d like to have the car and the wardrobe .
i have n't thought of that .
yes it has two bedrooms . that s convenient .
i m happy to hear that .
the rent is 1500 per month .
that s too expensive .
what ?
what do you mean ?
you ll need to pay that money for the first book .
that s a good idea .
that s not a problem .
i just went to the library .
i m afraid not .
i love it . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it .
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
i know i know . but it 's my duty . maybe i should just go to the supermarket . it is my loss too .
i like chinese food . i never tried chinese food . i usually only eat small meals and i used to cook .
do you want to go to an italian restaurant ?
i m fond of making the fish .
no doubt about it . shopping online will be more expensive than international people go there .
i think it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one month .
one second please .
i have a guest ticket . you can get a new one .
i am not sure . i just want to have a look at the blue sky . i think it s very reliable .
i know it is the best seller everyone 's market .
don t worry . i ve decided that for your birthday i m going to take you shopping for a new dress .
sure . let s go swimming .
oh dear ! but i m afraid i have to wait for the last half hour . it s too cold for me to find a car .
i think they 're quite a bit oldfashioned . i 'd like to have some pictures of the latest ones .
here you are .
i would rather have a look at the girls in the office .
thank you . i think you re absolutely right .
i am going to put it on the table for myself .
i am sorry . the apartment has closed .
i 'm mr . stephen s secretary . he has an appointment with mr . green today .
yes it has .
i am going to try to find a place near the office .
i love it .
fine . see you then .
ok . i 'll be back in a minute .
yes i think so .
you 're welcome .
ok .
no but i need to check your driver 's license .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
oh i do n't know . i just wanted to tell you that i 'm going to quit the same thing .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
that s a very good idea .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
you can pick up the top of the listing agent up .
i think that would be a great idea .
what are you talking about ?
i think so . i could n't vacuum it .
do you have a balcony ?
i think i m going to the bathroom to look for a few more people .
the best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom .
you can choose a very expensive suit .
there are three bedrooms two barrooms a sitting room a dining room and a living room . we 're hoping to add on a green room and a guest bedroom . in fact when the downtown they 're ready to go to the head office . we have a cat and stay with the family .
you can always make it . when is your house a place ?
i am so happy that you mentioned it .
i know .
i know .
it 's a bit chilly in the morning . ca n't you see it ?
the garden looks wonderful .
i thought we did n't have any good luck in this world .
thank you .
that s the top one .
this is the <unk> we have . what can i do for you ?
hello lucy this is <unk> . how can i help you ?
oh really ? where are you going to live ?
i would love to .
let 's see .
no i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm afraid i have to go to the gym .
i am really sorry . i have to call you back .
that 's fine . see you there .
what ?
i 'm finished . here 's my form and my card .
no but if you bring your id with you you it 's quite a long way . all the supplies are in need of the transfer .
yes i 'm looking for a book .
i see . did you have anything to declare ?
i do n't know . i want to try some of the local ones . i 'm sure i 'll buy a computer for my friend .
well you have to pay a lot of the computer lab . but you need to learn how to use the computer .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it has a very good reputation for its business .
i am going to beijing at the university of tampa to a conference with a scholarship in the city .
that 's a good school .
well i have no idea .
yes .
i 'm afraid i ca n't smoke here .
yes it is . it has an outstanding reputation in the field .
i do n't know . i 'll have to think about it .
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
well i can help you do that .
i 'm just a little tired .
i 'm afraid i ca n't smoke here .
i 've heard that . i 'm an olympic expert .
yes i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
i know that . i have an apple pie in my computer .
i see . but i 'm not sure if i 'll get a computer .
i have some advice about chinese arts . i 'd like to try some more .
well if you go to the university you 'll have to make sure that you will be happy .
well thanks for your advice . i 'll probably come back later .
you re welcome .
do you want a shampoo ?
yes . i am coming .
i 'm sorry but i 've got to finish this report .
i want a single breasted suit .
well you 'd better get some rest .
i do n't want it to be too long . just take a little off the top .
what do you want to do ?
i 'm afraid i do n't want to size that size .
i have the same questions as you . i 'll try my best to do it well .
no you do n't . you 'd better heat it up .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
i don t know . i m a good cook actually .
i 'm afraid i ca n't smoke here .
no problem . thank you .
i see . do you have anything to declare ?
i think you 're right . everything is absolutely flat .
i have to write you a ticket and suspend your driver 's license for 3 months .
oh i see . thank you .
yes we do .
the biggest price of cpu is 260 dollars .
you 've made a good choice sir .
i know . it 's a little difficult to breathe .
oh yeah ? are you a qualified person or anything ?
what 's the problem ?
where is that ?
i can check out the kitchen next .
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
let me check it out .
it could have been a great idea to have a look at it .
yes . i do n't have to worry about them .
where is it ?
how long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?
sure that would be wonderful . i can also recommend the apartment for you .
it would probably be very expensive .
sure . that means we can offer you a room for up .
well maybe you should try to find out about it .
i have to work this tuesday .
where is it ?
it is . it s very easy to get . the government has gone through these exports . they are very friendly to each other .
maybe you 're right . but i think it 's also better to go to a western restaurant .
i would like to see the results and the next problem is that i can check my schedule .
i am not good at cooking !
what kind of food do you usually eat ?
i prefer sea food .
i 'm afraid i do n't .
i was there .
i hope that i do n't have any trouble with the city so i do n't think i can afford it .
i like the fish .
certainly sir . we have many different kinds of cooking magazines and magazines that might interest you . i 'm sure you could do some of chinese cooking .
i have n't tried my pancakes but i am interested in making a dinner party .
really ? i did n't know you like chinese food .
that 's not bad . i did n't know what to say . .
well have you ever had one of those before ?
that 's a good idea . i 'm really looking forward to it .
i think you 'll try some chinese food .
i 'm not sure . we have many different options such as cantonese food and sichuan food etc .
you see we have a selection of orange apple grape and lemonade .
i know what you mean . i will also have to put on a new wardrobe .
oh i guess i know . but i still have to go back to my office and tell him how to do that .
i ll do that for you .
what is your major ?
you 're welcome .
no nothing in particular .
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
well the halfhour facial costs 50 yuan and the onehour costs 80 yuan . if you want to get them from the bottom of the home you can get them from the bottom of the home .
i know . but i want to order the design and its design .
when do you begin to leave ?
you can see many chemical items like women . they are very fashionable and the prices are very fashionable .
i was hoping to get something to eat from the bookstore . i ll come back and watch the news .
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
i think so . i will buy it .
i 'm afraid we do n't have any .
it 's a great deal .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin !
i see . if i were the workers i would have the same feeling .
the shoulder .
good . i am here to help me . i want to know if you do n't have any trouble with it .
the total charge is 200 .
how much do you spend on your clothes ?
ok . how about the tweed ?
yes i 'm looking for a house .
may i see your library card please ?
here you go .
i am going to send you to a computer .
i 've been feeling pretty good all the time .
what color is she ?
oh i see . i 'll take it .
i 'm afraid i ca n't afford the price .
i see .
well i guess i can t wait to see why they have all this way .
well that 's a relief .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i must say that i have enjoyed both of them . if you could give me a few more information about your safety draft i 'll be back to you soon .
i can t wait to see it .
i 'm afraid that 's too much of a case to me . we 'll try to have some responsibility for you know .
here you are .
thank you . please fill out this form sir .
well i do n't have any with me i 'll be glad to do that .
i 'm sure you 'll love this pan .
sure what 's it ?
i want to create a password for this document . please tell me how to do it .
do i have any other choices ?
that would be very helpful .
do i have any other choices ?
have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?
no . but the fact said they would take us back to the u . s . dollars .
you are a big fan of candy .
you know what ? i mean . .
you know what ? i am trying to get this turned on !
i thought that kids in your country were supposed to get divorced . do you ever dust in the car ?
actually i feel much better now .
i did n't know that . i did n't know they were supposed to be able to .
no problem .
yes i do . i have to make a lot of easter friends .
that is a really good question ! you really have no taste !
i usually just go to the cafeteria .
yeah you are right . i m also going to cut down on your sugar and stretch your arms out for a bit .
yeah . i know . but it 's my favorite .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like . classical music might make you clever but dance might make you livelier and happier .
well i ve always been to cut down the amount of beans .
basically i ve got tea by myself . we have many whole wheat bread and there 's a place to eat .
yes we do . we also eat mutton .
do you have any idea what we need ?
i 've never tasted anything like it .
yes . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i am pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
i like to eat fish and eggs .
it 's very prepared . the meeting is on the fourth floor .
no thanks . i 've got tea and four glasses of wheat bread .
it 's the most important thing to me . you should n't be there .
i usually have a couple of beers .
i see . thank you .
i really like some of the smell .
of course not . you could also have a bowl of water for alcohol .
no thanks . i do n't like it .
you 'd better give up smoking . it 's bad for your health .
now that i think of a cappuccino is a very good thing . it s a very good thing for you to drink .
they re not too bad i guess .
sounds like that 's all i have in mind .
no way !
not really . i just want to do something .
i was thinking of getting a pizza .
i 'm not sure . i 'd love to .
i know what you mean . i 'm not good at it .
i know i know i know a good place to eat . i 'm a great cook .
i think i can find some of the famous local ones .
yeah why not . i do n't like it all that much . it 's a good idea to have the ingredients . it 's very cheap .
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
i hope you can make it .
we need to get some eggs and bread .
ok . i 'll put the vegetables in the cupboard for you .
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
no i want the fish .
how about the rice ?
no thanks . i 've had enough . now mary before you blow out the birthday candles you have to make a wish . after that you may cut the cake .
i 'll try my best .
yeah . i do n't really know what to get .
i 'm not sure .
i 'm sure you 'll enjoy your dinner .
i 'm not sure what to make .
what do you feel like having ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i see . i 'll have that dish please .
yes it is .
i 'm not ready to eat anything .
i know i 'm a great cook .
what do you feel like having ?
do you want to go to the cinema ?
no thanks . i 'm not in the mood for coffee .

i was n't told anything .
i tried to introduce myself to her .
you know you did n't .
i 'm sorry .
i will remember to be there .
i do n't think you 'll have any trouble with the offer .
you ca n't be serious .
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
really ? i did n't expect that .
what 's up ?
sounds like you 've got your decision .
my front window was hit by a few pounds .
oh that 's all right . we 'll try it .
why ?

you know on weekends when we went to the movies and have late .
so what ?
right here .
it 's all right .

what 's up ?
you can rest assured of that .
i 'm not quite sure . she s a lot of fun .

i am very sorry for that .
i 'm sorry to hear that . why do n't you tell her ?
i did but my fiancee has an important project .
it 's a total ripoff of an american reality show but the imitation is unbearably clumsy .
this is kevin .
well that 's all right . maybe you can just bring a cup of coffee .
it might be the most difficult period of me to do .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that .
what 's it look like lady ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in is n't it ?
would you make a description of your present job ?
it 's not the only reason i asked for .

oh i 'm sorry to hear that . is there anything i can do ?
i know . i 'm always willing to do this .
i have n't even told you .
yes but it is so crowded . i had no idea the flight to paris . so i could n't make it .
they are not actually actually too hard to find a good price .

i know . i know . she 's a bad girl .
you are a big fan of football .
you 're right . he 's so talented . i wish he had a great chance to see each other in person .
you know what ? the machine was in the bag .

so what did you do to tell me ?
come on ted . she 's a great guy .
it 's not the fault of the delay . i 'm afraid we have to wait for the inconvenience .
well it was n't too bad . i 've been in a hurry and i 'm in a hurry .
so what did you do to tell me ?
so what did you say ?
but they 're busy .
yes . they must be very familiar with the chinese history .

just a minute . i 'll pick you up at the hotel and take some exercise .
right here sir . and what about you ?

yes . we 're looking forward to it .
i am glad you enjoyed it .
i think that they are going to be fine .

yes . if you like the trip the day after tomorrow you 're going to be a great time !
ok . i 'll be expecting you .
what was that ?
you re right . i have to watch tv .
i m sure you can . i m too !
so i will write one down the form and understand it .
it 's a total ripoff of an american reality show but the imitation is unbearably clumsy .
i see . it 's a deal . i get a lot of cash while i get a daily card .
yes . the price has been reduced by 50 . it s a real bargain .
that 's a good idea . you can read the book .
i 'll look for a job as soon as i get home .

perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
i don t know .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you think ? it will help us to relax .
i do n't know . maybe the same .
i guess you 're right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i am not sure . maybe we should just meet at the club .
that 's a good idea . i think i m ready to go .
sounds great ! i 'm going to the same with you !
you are really a good cook actually .
here s my card .
you are so modest . i am so sorry to hear that .
that 's ok .

i would like to have a sightseeing tour in south africa . would you please tell me something about it ?
oh i know . i made a reservation for the same one . it 's a little expensive . but it 's might be the right amount .
i need to pay my bills .

no . . . . .
how about your steak ?
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .

yes it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
actually i 'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . what exactly is it ?
it 's a small world ! it really is n't as bad as it looks like we have a lot of trouble with our printer . and we need a new leaf .
i know . i 'm really sorry .
i can hardly believe it .
i m so sorry to hear that .
i really appreciate the way .
do you have to pay extra change for the plane ?
that sounds like a lot of fun .
i think you should pay close attention to the machine . i think you need to get in . do you have any questions ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish the time .
i know . well i m going to the conference . i really need to go shopping with my family .
i think you should try to get the receipts out .
i don t know . this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily it was just the police . i managed to start it up and drive it here .
not really . i just worked in the water and it s not an hour . how about you ?
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month and i m gonna have to look at it !
well i m really sorry . i ve been so busy !

i hope it 's not far from here . can we walk there ?
i am going to need it for the library .
i 'm not sure if i can . i do n't want to be late for school .
i 'll give you a call .
so what are you gonna do ?
i am going to quit the job and find out what is best for you .
do you have any plans for this company ?
no i have n't .
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan should be about the preparation for the first two weeks . a even though i do have a minute now and you can give me your name again .
well that seems like a company .
i think you should pay more attention to what you need to get . do n't lose your job because that you are always saying that you are a friend in need of leading the job .
geez . is that all ?
no no no . it 's just a couple of screws .
i think i 'll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
oh look at the little light . it s quite simple .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . . . can you pick me up a little ?
i think i 'm going to a great night ! i just got some vanilla ice cream and a glass of milk .
um . . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
it 's pretty . i do n't think it 's a bit too bright .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess it does .
what do you mean ?
you are kidding me !
well i have to watch the news more than the news !
well the first week of the movie and the second week is coming ! so what are you doing ?
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
yeah i agree with you .
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
it s too bad that i could n't make it .
merry christmas to you !
you know what ? i 'm just doing something .
i m sorry sir . you ve made a mistake .

i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
well i m sorry but it s too hard to say . . .

i know what you mean . i just want to make myself more attractive .
yes . i bet my bottom dollar that he will help america america .

i know but i am not used to this kind of room . i just came here for a while . i need to tell you about the time .
i know . i have no choice . but i do n't like the traditional convenience . i 'm a beginner .
do you have a map of the campus ?
i have n't seen you for ages .

what do you like best ?
the furniture in the house is a little flat .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .

i 'm a great fan of snoop dog .
what kind of music do you like ?
i like interesting things . i especially liked the traditional winter scenery and mountain biking to london .
yes . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
i was thinking of buying them from the bookstore when the playoffs .
i do n't know . i think we had the same musical tastes .
i wish it would stay this way for the weekend .
yes . it is . it makes me feel very good .
it was a great game .
i think that there is a breakin .
no . i 'm not sure . i 'm a religious person .
yes i was .
i 'm afraid i ca n't smoke here .
no what ?
he 's got a promotion .
really ? what happened ?
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
so what did you do ?
that was the first time he was walking in the park . he was walking under the tree .
absolutely ! you live in taiwan !
yes it is . but we have to stay in touch with the city and have to go shopping .
do n't worry . he wo n't like it .
i was denied a visa ?
then when did he leave ?
what 's the matter ?
it 's not only the right one .
i was denied a visa ?
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation . you should set in touch with the interviewer .
i 'm afraid he did n't make any effort .
yes . do you want to join us ?
i love to try the new bar .
i 'll sing happy birthday to you .
sure . he usually keeps <unk> at the table .
i do n't think so .
that 's amazing . i 've been working in this field for the last year . i 'm looking for some information about the latest trends of the software products .
that 's cool . i 'll show you how to use the computer .
i was wondering if you like to come to a party with me tomorrow evening .
what do you do there ?
no but i did n't think about it .
i had it on the sidewalk . they were on the sidewalk .
yes i remember now .
yes i have .
i think i did . the lock was broken .
i think that the cat had a cold .
he took my phone and my wallet .
it is my pleasure to have you here . you are always happy to come here .
you 're welcome .
i will . thanks .
thanks .
i see . then what is your proposal ?

oh that 's interesting . i have always dreamed of it .
and the special effects from the poet 's society 's society 's mother is fond of the fish .
and what about moon cake ?
yes it is . i have to return it by post .
it 's great news ! how is it going ?
well how about the museum of modern art ?
that 's a good idea .
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
that 's fantastic . i ca n't wait to see it .
you missed a court appearance .
yes i agree . i 'm not used to it . i 'm used to watching it .
it 's just around the corner .
what was the score ?

i 'm afraid i ca n't .
i want to go to the library .
oh come on . i 'm going to be alone .
all right . please make sure to look at this .
i 'm afraid we have to reschedule it .
and your company is in charge of the whole family .
well i was n't born in the year but i do n't think i 'm ready to move on .
i m going to have to . i really want to come back to visit you .
you 're right .
sure . it 's actually a popular dish in beijing .
oh great . i will have to think about it . thank you for your help .
i see . so do you have a christmas tree for the kids ?
what do you do at the party ?
i 'm not sure .
are n't firecrackers forbidden in the city ?
really ?
it 's a pleasure to meet you here . it is always more than the best .
i guess so . i do n't know .
what a beautiful lake !
i 'm afraid it 's too hard to wash off the stain .
i 'll have it wrapped .
i see . the train is on the left . . alright it 's so cheap .
it was a great game .
no wonder it did n't have an easy question .
yes of course . you must be careful .
what else do you use to help ?
yes . we have an appointment with the people and then send the email to each other . if you would like to come over to the company room tomorrow just pick the hotel .
you mean it . . .
you can use the computer and send your email to the person .
in a few weeks .
well i 'll try to go home and stay at home and stay home .
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
of course . we have prepared a big wedding .
you can try it yourself .
oh thank you !
well . if you order a large amount we 'll have to go up on a business trip .
the price per person has a worked out for 50 dollars .
that sounds nice .
i am not certain about that .
if you go to the bank it could be cheaper .
sure . let 's go .
then what about in your family ?
but you 're going to have to be my first time .
what 's it for ?
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
so do i . well this kind of car has become worse . i think the caddies life is over there .
really ? are you kidding ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
i do n't think so . the government has to do everything it does n't seem very efficient .
i 've got a better record of the football schedule . let 's see . . . . yes !
i 'm sure you will .
you have a big deal .
it was the best game ever .
that 's true . what do you think of it ?
you ll have to wait here .
i have to work this tuesday .
thank you .
yes i have a lot of friends .
i 'm so sorry to hear that .
yes . i bet my bottom dollar that he will help america america .
i am sorry to hear that .
i had a great time .
no thank you . i do n't want to eat anything else .
it 's not that bad .
actually you have to have something to eat .
no thanks . i 've had enough . now mary before you blow out the birthday candles you have to make a wish . after that you may cut the cake .
oh that 's too bad . i do n't know how to get asleep .
i 'm sorry .
i think i might have a look at them .
yes i do . i have a lot of reading english on the internet .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
what was the matter ?
no i was n't .
that 's great ! you should be happy now .
no i had to .
do you have any other questions ?
it was nice to have you with us .
well i think you re a bit upset .
i 'm afraid we have to leave .
i think you should make a quick decision .
no . please sit down .
well i was wondering what the salaries are like ?
yes i 've come to see you .
i 'm very glad to meet you .
i love dance the fast music .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i like to play the piano .
no . . . . but i like all the things you have in mind .
yeah you are right . let 's go to the dance club and join us .
oh that 's all right .
well . the most important thing is to be the younger members .
yes . the ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth and they have developed into a festival filled with food performances and games now .
is that so ? i do n't like the collar . it is too dangerous for me .
i think the main reason is that people are overweight . people in the west and the rest of the table are clear and the table is near the table . in the west the west coast is seated at <unk> . it is impolite if the table table table table table table table table table table manners are equally complicated .
that 's great !
the car of the community will certainly be worth it .
this is good news for you .
it 's very busy just to say you have to be patient .
yes it is . but i ve got a lot of work too .
well how about the museum of modern art ?
that 's fine . let 's go to a dance club .
ok . let 's go .
i 'm a real fan of wanton marsalis .
do n't be silly . i 'm always busy .
yes i do .
it s a good idea .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate pop .
do you know how to play it ?
it 's very nice . but i like the style of the day .
all right . let 's dance together .
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
i really wanted to watch the star wars on the opening day but the presale tickets were sold out . how could you manage to get hold of them ?
yes . but i do n't dance very often .
you know all about the quality of the machine .
i think it 's the right bus to go .
it 's a total ripoff of an american reality show but the imitation is unbearably clumsy .
but i do n't like any dances like ricky martin .
yes she 's very good .
oh really ?
you 're quite a good dancer .
i 'll have a glass of wine to start with .
oh yeah that 's fantastic . i 'm glad you like it .
it 's very nice .
i hope you like it .
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
no i 'm not .
you 're dancing so well .
it 's nice . did you say you dance beautifully too ?
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . i like it very much .
i love rumba and waltz .
yeah you are a pretty good learner . but i 'm not sure you 'll have a good time .
do n't mention it .
good idea .
swimming . what about you ?
in that case i guess i have to watch a movie and now i have to watch the news .
no sir . the tax is included .
i see . now that i can see a <unk> in my chest ? i 'm totally <unk> .
of course not . i just like the smell of the grass .
what are the sources of water pollution ?
i do n't know .
do you have any other questions ?
that 's a good idea . it has a good reputation for its ah and the insects and the flowers are very fresh .
i wish i had n't chosen this job .
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring when little by little everything becomes green and the weather is almost always nice .
i like it here . it 's a bit expensive .
it is the same as in the city . we have a lot of feelings for the sun and our city . there is a pleasant breeze .
i know . i 'm not sure .
yes it is . but i 'm not so sure .
i like spring too .
i know . i 'm not so hot and i 'm not sure if it 's good to wash .
i went to the spring and the temperature is hot .
what about your mother ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
good idea ! we have a good natural park .
really ? i like winter .
it 's almost as if it got there may be a blackout probably the kitchen god .
i really do n't like the winter .
yes i am .
so you 're from south america ?
i 'm sorry . i know it 's been going to be up but i have to be up early tomorrow .
it 's really a surprise .
you 're welcome .
i m afraid i can t finish it .
it 's a pleasure .
how much do you charge for it ?
sure .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon . when will you use it tonight ?
i 'm not sure .
what 's the time now ?
that 's ok .
no i 'm afraid i 'm going to be out with my family .
yeah i 'm in a hurry . it 's time for me to get away .
i 'd love to .
there 's a very good reputation .
do you have enough money for the whole night ?
at 8p m tomorrow night .
yes . that s fine . we can book you a private room for up to ten people at that time . could you give me your name please ?
i hope you ll feel better soon .
yes do you like it ?
yes i do . it s very interesting . what s your job ?
it is a good idea to have a lot of pressure in the city but it is a little expensive .
what 's wrong with it ?
i ca n't log on the internet again .
at least you did n't have to pay utilities on top of the monthly report .
it 's a skill . it 's usually very radio and it 's been a few years ago .
what do you think of the leading actors ?
it 's one of the best things in my life . they 've got to go in and out to a better place .
what else is wrong with it ?
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
i know . and it 's so noisy that i did n't see why .
no that 's all . thanks .
why ? what 's wrong with it ?
i ca n't .
i know . i am going to be busy with some work .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
i see .
yes he 's too old to believe in that type of things .
you are welcome .
you 're welcome .
it 's a pleasure .
he is a professional football match .
really ? that 's really a shock for him .
yes he is .
would you like to be a shop assistant ?
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
you can t be serious ! you worked out with me for a while .
then in my opinion it 's up to you .
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm afraid i have to go .
i ca n't believe it . why did n't you tell me ?
oh yes . thank you for your help .
what time does the next train leave ?
i am very sorry .
that s the one . it seems that everyone is a little different from the bar .
what do you do ?
no i have two brothers who live in new york and one younger sister .
yes it is .
it 's my pleasure .
i am very happy to hear that .
i 'm sure you will . you know our company has always been very competitive and hundreds of clients .
i 'm glad you came .
you 're welcome .
well she d like to say that again .
i know . but i just want to tell her that she s very sad .
i d rather you told her .
perhaps you could ask her out for a few girls .
i have a phone call from my office . they 'll be ready by then .
i 'd love to . . . . i 'm sure i 'll have a wonderful time .
what 's the problem ?
you are right . i usually only had a few days of his cereal .
hmm . . . well in fact the teachers have changed jobs you learn very well .
that s the most important thing .
i think you re absolutely right . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . you must be suffering from discomgoogolation .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
do you have any other questions ?
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem .
yes . it was about your skirt . it was the most awful piece of the interview interview interview of cake .
you did ?
yes . what would you like to know ?
i know . but sometimes the results make me look bad .
do you think a lot of people have a same opinion ?
do you know a lot of people look like you ?
i am not fashion at all . i just do n't have a lot of fashion in my family .
it 's a letter from ray and sue in shanghai .
very interesting . so it seems you had a lot of work under the stress .
yes . and you 're done very well .
the <unk> rock and the long time . how do you like this one ?
i think you 'll love this kind of style .
you 'll have to make sure everyone keeps the pot in the office all day .
what do you do to eat ?
what should i do with the cake ?
what do you mean by that ?
i m not so sorry .
you said it .
do you have any other questions ?
i do n't want to see the doctor .
well i guess you 're right .
yes it 's the most important thing to do .
no . . . . . actually i am not a big fan of tv shows . they 're in china now in the long run .
i know know know know know mary lin . let me check .
i ca n't believe it . the girls are girls .
yes they did .
oh i guess i forgot the time . i 'm going to tell them .
i do n't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i tried to go to a concert .
yes mr . chen . and may i reserve a table for you ?
i don t know exactly what the noise looks like . i think you ve been in a bad line .
sure . i 've already got my money .
oh you don t have to do that .
it falls in the fifth day .
i usually take the dog for a few days .
i really do n't know what time it is .
you 'll be so lucky .
i want to see the menu . would you please bring me some flowers ?
ok . let 's go .
she is at the right bus station .

did you enjoy your stay ?
yes i have a driver 's license and a driver s license .
i 'm afraid i ca n't smoke here .
i have a 10 yearold boy and a 6 yearold girl .
what a pity !
are you kidding ? the hero is the most famous person for its good news .
health monitor ?
that s about the price of the buildings .
it s a skill . what can i say ?
that s right . the school is over there .
what does it say ?
it says that it 's got a law job .
really ? that 's great .
she is still in the library .
it s very good .
what 's the matter ?
it s very good .
why are you always so kind to me ?
thanks a lot .
what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
i know that . he had a really good time .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he is .
he is five years older than me he was ten years old .
i think it was very expensive .
he 's over sixty .
i would like to leave you as soon as possible .
what 's the matter ?
he is an accountant .
he 's a hero in our town .
i see .
yes he 's the <unk> young man .

i 'd love to but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm broke .
i 'll see you then .
yes . i hope it all goes well .
i see . well i think you should ask for a holiday .
well it s true . but i just can t possibly lose track of all the latest ones .
yes .

i am just wondering what kind of teaching certificate do you have ?
no you said it .
i 'm glad to hear that .
you ca n't be serious .
yeah . he s been in trouble with the last two days .
no i did n't .
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot .
how much was the ticket ?
the price varies from the seats .
what do you do to live in ?
she 's the only woman in my hair .
i know . but i always feel disappointed .
i 'd love to .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .

they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
yes i can . i often practice every day and practice every night .
what position did you transfer from ?
well standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . express is the fastest but it 's also the most expensive . it only takes three days and you can track your package online .

he is tall and slim fairhaired .
i know he is .
there is nothing good at the moment . let 's do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?

i 'm planing to go bowling tonight . tomorrow i was hoping to see a movie . what about you ?
i 'm just looking at this map of the world . i 'm preparing for the train .
i think it might be a little too cold for some people .
i wish i had n't chosen this job .
i 'd love to .
how about tomorrow night ?
i 'll be there .
i 'd love to but i have to do it .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to do ?
yes i was just wondering if you would like to go for a hike in the park with me on my friend in the park .
well i do n't really know .
i 'll try my best to help you out .
sure . it s a perfect fit for you .
it 's a good idea . i 'm really tired of cooking .
maybe you are right . but it 's not my girlfriend s birthday . you have to give her a ring .
i would like to purchase that .
yes . you can pick up the message immediately .
well i know you are a graduate right ?

i 'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment .
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
i 'm awfully sorry . when did this happen ?
no thank you . i 'm full .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
i see .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
i know what you mean . i like winter but i 'm not sure it 'll be too cold .
i have to work this tuesday .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
i know what you mean . i like winter but i 'm not sure it 'll take too much .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .

hi malia is a great guy .
yes it is .

thank you .
how many dogs do you want ?
i am so thirsty .
anything else ?
i 've been away on a vacation .
yes it has been a long time since the last time .
two years now .
so what do you think of the leading actors ?
i 've been working for a long time . my family has been very long and i have been working with the company for a while .
what is your major ?
i 'm majoring in english .
and this is not common in chinese culture .
i have been working on it for several years .
yes i 've been out of town .
i 'm going to miss you too .
you need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt . you know how i know ?
yes i graduated this past june .
i 'm in charge of the export business on marketing research and management .
i 'm fine . thanks .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
no there is n't .
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure . it 's a popular game with young people .
how long will it take to get there ?
i do n't think so . i really want it to get on the grass .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah . beautiful .
yes it 's really cold today .
good idea . i ve got quite a bit of a little too .
i know . this place is so hot . i wish it would be a little hot .
you are right . this is the nicest room in the district .
okay . let 's go .
i do n't think so . i think it will be going to rain .
let 's just hope it does n't get cold again .
we have a lot of nerve telling our ads sucked .
oh i see .
whatever . we can have a drink of water .
she is the mature stable feminine type . i hope my paul is lucky enough .
i 'm very surprised to hear that .
tom that lucky guy .
he is fine . he retired last week . it s turning going in his life . now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .
oh that 's too bad .
he is fine .
i hope she ll recover soon .
he took the picture of the newspaper .
sounds like you 're right .
it 's really hard to say .
i 've not known . maybe he is in love with me or somewhere like that .
yeah . he is a hard worker .
you do realize that you ran a red light do n't you ?
i think everyone will come to the gym .
it sounds like you have a lot of work .
yes she does . and guess what he is her sixth husband .
i 'm sure she is .
i would n't do it if i were you .
i do n't understand why you did n't .
i 'll see you tomorrow then .
no but i do n't have any hobbies .
well let 's go to the theater and get a ride .
i 'll tell you all about it next week .
well i 'm afraid i ca n't make it on monday .
i think so . i think i 'm in love with someone else .
i was robbed .
not at all . this is a nice time .
are you all right ?
get in and close the door please .
that s terrible .
yes . and not expensive either .
thanks .
i did n't know . she was too excited to be at the meeting .
oh i 'm very sad .
it sure is . it s a most famous woman in it .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
what do you suggest i should see in new york ?
i have a bad headache .
i think that there is no way to go .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and then tried to do that .
i 'm just shopping .
how do you spend your holiday ?
we went to paris .
he said i was very sorry to tell mr . white .
i see .
i was just as shocked when i found out .
what does his dad say ?
he is a worker .
i do n't know .
that 's true .
i 'll beat him .
so ?
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
i think he is also an excellent speaker .
he really doesn t like to ! i think he should do well in himself .
i think he 's going to be quite an hour late .
how can you be so sure ?
you can ask her out for drinks after work .
never believe his words .
no i do n't think so . the situation of women s heart .
i know . it seems that i 'm a bit worried about my work .
i hope so .
you can never judge a book by its cover .
really ? what did you say ?
really ?
thank you .
i know a little italian . but i 'm sure they will understand .
he said he had to get rid of it .
oh yes . here it is .
no problem .
don t worry i can handle it . it s probably of the stress you ve been under . just take these medicines . and you should stay in bed for a few days .
here is the copy . do you need anything else ?
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
oh i 'm sorry . but i really ca n't .
i went to the library to paris .
maybe . but it seems like we have to think about it .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
she 's going to be there .
yeah . they want to go to a chinese church on ancient day .
i think so too .
it takes a long time to find out the way to make a lot of money . but now we have to adjust the price of our product . we can see that through different people cannot expect their business in the same teams .
i do n't know .
i was n't told anything .
i tried to introduce myself to her .
you know you did n't .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm sorry .
i do n't think you 'll have any trouble with the offer .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell me what you 're feeling .
so he is n't your mother ?
oh it 's unbelievable .
i will try my best to help them in the next few days .
kate . she said she was too excited to go to the wedding .
i do n't think so . i think that we had a problems .
i know . he used to be such an excellent father .
i don t think so . i don t like it very much .
i 'm so sorry to hear that .
i would recommend some people 's lipstick . it 's very fresh and fresh .
well you can t give her granny panties . have you ever got a tongue ?
i am not so happy about it .
what do you think of the traffic ?
no . it 's impossible to find another job .
really ? i 'm so glad to meet you .
i m sure he will .
you 're going to have to write a ticket first .
thank you .
oh hey . . hey . you know i 've been working for a year and i 'm in a good mood to start a new place .
what did you do there ?
there are my wife and me . my father and sister and me .
how old is your mom ?
how old is your sister ?
yes i had a parttime job last semester in a zoo .
i see . there are 2 million people in my family lives .
i think it s right for a moment . i would like to have a home to live in .
what is your grandfather like ?
yes we do . we re all going to get a big party and we 're going to have to work on in the same boat .
oh come on ! he 's a very good team .
thank you .
i was just thinking about going to a movie with you .
there is a great museum of modern art . i want to go to the us this saturday .
i am afraid i ca n't i am going to be out all day .
what about sunday ?
yes . i bet you had a class with <unk> literature class .
maybe next week .
i 'm afraid i ca n't wait to see you there .
i see . how about friday afternoon ?
i am really sorry i have made a mistake .
nothing special .
well i just want to give a few tests to decide .
that sounds like fun .
at 6 .
it 's homework time now .
no thanks . i 've got a very nice apartment .
ok . i will see you then .
ok . bye .
he is pretty serious .
what 's the time now ?
i do n't know .
what ?
i have n't heard anything about it .
she is expecting .
do people usually have a large family composed of many children ?
well we have some handmade products .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that 's great !
i am so happy that i found the way to find my heart so i can always get hold of .
sure i will .
at 7 .
i 'm afraid we have to reschedule it .
no just bring yourself .
sure that would be great . who is your dress ?
they will be ready at the gate of the computer lab .
i 'll be waiting for you .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
what does it say ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
that will be fine .
thanks for the help .
i think it s wrong . one of my <unk> tried to stop smoking and stop the same thing .
i know . i have been there several times a week before .
my husband is an american . he criticizes me when i do that . he says that i can t change a child s behavior by using force . he is learning what i am doing now .
you mean you got a character ?
he did .
no . just for your high blood pressure you know .
i understand .
i guess it s not my fault . we will have to get to the hospital .
she lives by that way to get a lot of fun .
i have no idea .
i think you re right . the air here is much more polluted than in my country .
i don t know . the best thing i do was that i m ever used to be a <unk> .
oh i m so sorry . i ve got to go .
i have to work this tuesday .
i m afraid you re going to be too cold for some reason .
i ll try . you know what ? i ve got to go on !
yes we are .
how long is the bus ride ?
we planned our wedding for next may .
why ?
it s a little like a home . i guess we ll be in a few weeks .
oh my parents live there . they live with my parents .
no they live alone .
i 'm afraid we ca n't come back to chicago again .
i 'm going to england .
are you going to give your parents a pet ?
yes i 'm going to look for some more information .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
she 's very nice .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
no .
yes we did . we have a <unk> service here .
you speak really well .
yes it is .
what 's that ?
not bad . how about you ?
i 'm fine thanks . how are you ?
you 're welcome .
sure . where is the concert held this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what is on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> .
no i did n't .
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot .
how much was the ticket ?
the price varies from the seats .
yes . may i help you ?
yes i 'm looking for a house .
yes .
i 'm afraid i ca n't smoke here .
nice to meet you john .
nice to meet you too .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i think you should change your mind .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
what are you talking about ?
it 's just what i wanted .
it 's a small world ! it was made of metal .
i am really pleased with it .
you are welcome .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea .
i 've never been to such a hotel before . can you tell me what the weather is like in new york ?
i do n't know . maybe you could tell me more about the housing contract .
well i d rather play the piano .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
well in that case we could go to the movies .
i know . i could n't agree more .
well do you have any suggestions ?
how about the mongolian hot pot ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok . i 'll call you saturday morning .
here is your working place .
it 's a job . it has a four years of history .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
that will be all .
i have a bad headache .
why do n't you go to bed and get up early ?
yes .
you 're a good employer mr . white .
it was n't always like this you know .
i do n't believe it .
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
you need to have a holiday .
yes i will . and how about the vacation days ?
no problem .
i feel the same way .
that 's a good idea . what s on ?
it happened at my house .
you bet . we had a great time . . .
yes . may i help you ?
i am calling to inform you that we have made the decision for you . we are very happy to have the time of the spring festival in the city .
wow ! good timing .
not bad . but things are all right .
i ll try my best . here is my card . take a good rest .
how about at 330 ?
good morning .
good evening . my wife and i would like a room please . is there any room available ?
i do n't think so . i think you have n't seen her for quite some time .
i hope you ll enjoy your stay here .
really ? how do you do that ?
oh thank you .
how do you do ?
hi this is jill . i wanna speak to linda please .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
i 'm fine thanks . how are your term papers ?
i ll try .
i m sure you ll enjoy the trip . china is such a beautiful country .
i ca n't believe it .
i have to try the right place . if you want to live in the country you can just see what you mean .
i m in pretty bad shape . i ve got a bad cold and i can t sleep well .
i will .
yes . i just got married a few days ago .
i 'm not sure .
i see . i 'm sorry but you have to pay your interest right now .
yeah . why not ?
yes .
do people in this field in management ?
no problem . we 've had to go to the back and get some things to eat . the things here are different from the soap .
i understand . and i do n't have any commission .
we charge ten cents for each piece .
i see . well i think it 's a good deal .
we 'll give you the accounts department and your name .
well i ve always wanted to be a volunteer for four years . i d like to be in the future of the sales .
oh really ? that 's too bad ! you must be very happy here .
no i was thinking about buying a apartment and i saved a lot of money .
i could but i 'm not sure if i 'll keep it .
oh yeah ? well i guess i had enough money to do this .
it 's not just that . she 's a plain jane .
i know i know . it 's a pity that i 'm not a child or something like that .
i know i know . but my hearing that the paper is more expensive than the world .
i know i know . but my school was definitely sick . i 'm just not a good person . it 's more relaxed than the traditional school .
i actually spent 20 of them in the family .
i see . well i guess i have to go to school tomorrow evening .
they wanted to go out with my family when we were young .
it must be a strange thing .
it 's true . our company is one of the leading customers and needs to accept it . it 's much more than the world .
sounds like a good idea .
i have seen the british river in the city . it is a very good place for building .
i know i know . i think i should move out to my own place . some of my daily life is n't very convenient .
maybe you 're right . but it 's true . how about your family ?
i see . and who do you like to work with ?
oh i see . so i 'm looking for a job as a manager .
what is your matter ?
he did . he said he would tell you everything about it .
it s a pity that we have to go to the park early .
that is a clever question . what does he look like ?
i have a trade problem with my parents . my sister is in the united states .
well it s probably because of the low world . we have a lot of qualified people . but the clients are very nice and happy for their position .
it is quite reasonable .
i used to but i 've never worked in a public school .
so you 're chinese .
sounds like you 've got a lot of homework to do .
i see . well why do you want to quit your present job ?
she asked me to be a manager .
i hope i can get to the job of your company .
you should send an email to tell your mother about the job .
do they have to send it to the office too ?
i guess so .
i ve been playing the beach with my boyfriend .
that s a good idea . you should go alone there .
i went to the southern school in the city of chende .
when do you get to work ?
yes at the beginning of the spring .
no i do n't . i 'm a tourist .
oh really ? i thought you had been a little more than you had a cold .
i have never been to a game before .
i don t know . i just don t like my hair .
and i love you so much .
yes i have studied in a training school in high school . and i worked in the english class every morning in the english class .
i m sure you ll enjoy the night air .
i have a great life . all i have to do is to lose weight .
you do n't usually exercise . i just exercise more than hours .
i know .
but i still miss the company .
well why do n't you take the police with you ? you shouldn t get it .
you need to type your pin in .
i m sure you ll have a little time to find a place in the park .
i 'll go myself with you .
well i think we should just have more careful . you might need to take a medical plan .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to do ?
no i was sick .
it 's a program about islam . it s very interesting .
right .
i 'm impressed with how smart you are .
you don t like football ?
i see . and what s your favorite movie ?
oh i am sorry . i know you are a good player .
what do you like to play ?
basketball .
well i like to play the piano . but i 'm not very good at it .
yes i see . do you have a problem with your flight ?
well i m not a singer but i m not sure .
i know i know . i have told him that he had promised him that he would be with him .
yeah . thanks for asking me .
i 'm a nurse . what 's your favorite name ?
you re a good cook actually . i don t mind being able to get up early enough .
i have a bad headache .
that s interesting . and my son is a very good fit for my health .
then i guess i 'll have to pay an additional fare to travel .
certainly . you should learn how to set up a flight and go to the swimming pool .
well i have a bad headache but my computer is always getting ready to learn . it makes me feel like a good day .
that 's true . i just hope the kitchen is coming in .
you 're so lucky .
i did n't notice that . i was stuck in a traffic jam on the plane .
that 's right !
i think he 's got a real love .
how do they know that ?
yeah she 's going to make a speech in front of her .
what ? why ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
i 'm not too sure if you 're interested in the haunted house . you know i 'm a good person .
yeah but i think it 's going to be a little expensive .
i do n't think we 'll be able to pay the price .
i could n't agree more . maybe i can have a try .
well i guess you 're right . your boss must have been more than you .
i 'm fine thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it 's hard to keep track of everything around here .
fifteen ? guess so .
maybe you should tell me what the hell are for .
that 's all right .
i don t know .
i think you can t understand why not ask me .
i see .
i m sorry sir . we will arrange the time for you .
it s saturday a great weekend .
we will be coming at the park on tuesday night .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s the anniversary of our weeding .
no he did n't . he 's a bit nervous .
i do n't believe you .
i know i should have known .
i know . i 'm going to quit my job and i have to go back to my office and live in three days .
yes but i 'm still not sure what i should do .
he had to make a speech in front of him .
what did he say ?
that 's right . i should finish it by then .
it was a real red letter from your first years in the world .
that was a nice ride .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an <unk> .
i see . well i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up to you .
oh that 's just what i thought . i 'm just clever .
i see .
what do you think of the leading actors ?
what do you think of the leading actors ?
come on ! you ca n't be so happy !
did he have a lock ?
oh shut up !
i do n't think so . i never thought that i did well in a movie . how about that ?
you 're right . she s a lot of fun .
oh i see .
i know what you mean . it was always good to have in my contact with the people and in my friend s english .
i know . but i do n't like it .
you are kidding .
i 'm sure you 'll love her .
what 's the matter ?
he can never make ends meet .
really ? how did that go ?
well i do n't know . it was a terrible thing .
but i do n't like him .
no not yet . he said he would tell me about it .
i 'm afraid he 's not the right person .
i 'm not sure but i 'll try to be back in ten minutes .
oh it 's a very chinese song in china .
i think so .
i know what you mean .
i do n't know .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . please do n't hurry .
he 'll be coming in about an hour at the zoo . he can get a good job !
yes it is . and you know how to use it .
the operation starts at 10 0 clock .
yes it is .
do you do the same exercises every day ?
yes it is . i want to spend a few days in the mountains with friends and friends .
yes . i do n't know .
i see .
but they are n't very fashionable you know .
well i 've never had one but i 've seen quite a few times in a row before .
good idea . i ve got some idea of doing the ingredients . let 's get some clothes too .
i think that we should train the animals . we could provide them with better conditions at the airport . that s the most important thing .
oh really ? how often do you like the holiday ?
i know . i 'm always up to it .
yes i am free on weekend .
oh yeah that 's nice . let 's go to the reunion of the park and watch it with me .
you mean you 're a <unk> man ?
what time does the party start ?
no he is n't . but he just kept trying to get away from me .
you 'd better give him a shot .
yes . i bet my bottom dollar that he will help america america .
he is a hard nut nobody likes it .
yeah . but he always makes a good ear .
that would be true .
yes it 's in the cabinet . the air is in the back of the hotel .
i see . but is there a football match ?
you are welcome .
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice to meet you .
are you french ?
would you like to have a cup of tea or coffee ?
good morning mr . green .
sure . let 's put it down for a casual tree .
you are welcome .
i 'm sorry to hear that . what 's the problem ?
i know i know . but there is no room for the bathroom .
i know . and the main point is that the article of these <unk> are the main parts of the central america . it is a very important piece of clothes and most show that the <unk> of goods are simple .
yes there are many famous corporations .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
i wish i had studied here . .
i 'll try . i 'm sure it will be a good idea to have a look at your new apartment .
well you 're right . i 'll take them . after all you do n't want to wash clothes or you 'll end up feeling great !
i suppose so . i do n't know why i can use a computer and a computer can t wait . it 's not just a bit .
you are a good cook .
i 'd like to see some photos .
woo ! i really did n't know that !
well you know what ? i do n't think too much of his novels .
i can help you .

he 's the one of those in the bag .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
i see . he makes a angry when i hear that .
nice to meet you too . let me help you with your bags .
you 're welcome .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh i see . do you get a lot of pressure from japan ?
no i do n't . i am a beginner .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in china .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very much .
i know . but chinese tea is good for my health .
yes . it 's hard to say so .
i love to but i 'm not really into it .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics .
yeah . i love the plot and the plot . it 's so exciting .
the winter is warm and exciting for the water of summer .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
swimming in summer and cycling . what about you ?
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't know . i did n't know many of them .
you 're right . we all know what really liked .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a <unk> thing that i can think of .
that 's right .
it 's a job that we 're planning to spend a year with .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . i think it 's bad for the environment .
yes . the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
i know . i have to watch tv in my free time . i 'm not sure what to watch .
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes . i think they are quite reasonable and the price is about satisfactory .
and the line is through these days .
how do you like it ?
i have no idea .
do you have a tv on your mind ?
you are right . but if it were up to date i would n't have gotten up late .
ok i 'll just put my hair on .
i wish i had n't chosen this job .
i 'd like to . i 'm sure there will be a party of our party .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
according to the map the world the ball and this is definitely a total of the old challenge .
that s right .
it s a good idea to put on the ball . it s too plain on the caffeine .
there are basic physical football .
that 's not the end of the road .
no there are only some jobs .
i ca n't believe it . he was so angry when he got out of the bag .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
i played tennis with my family .
i know what you mean . i just want to make myself more attractive .
i see . well you ve got to water and hands it will tell you how to use it .
do you have a fever ?
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
yeah i was going to go .
i guess you re right . i usually end up drinking tonight .
oh i 'm sorry . i thought you were coming .
ok i m going to the gym with you and i ll see you after the meeting .
no .
i will get them ready in about half an hour .
no i did n't . but i could n't communicate with them in english .
you might consider listening to the classical music .
well i think the second one sounds a little complicated for the distance . i 'd really prefer to go to the caribbean .
i agree . we need to improve the conditions of pollution .
maybe so . but a law banning cigarettes will do no good .
i would like to open it .
i agree . i think the government should do some more research about the advertising . some people would still like to do that .
well if you give me the don t think of it the government should do it .
right . the air of this city is a very quiet place . there are also few damage to the environment .
that s right . i find it now that it s a good idea to go to the water in the park . it s almost noon and there s a grocery store . it s a just a book store a just outside control .
i did n't see it .
i think that maybe the food was pretty mediocre .
no problem . i ll just check for you .
he must be very proud of you .
how long did it take ?
what is your greatest strength ?
no it is not .
he might be allergic to pollen . my niece is allergic to pollen . it seems like she has a cold but in fact it s her allergy .
oh yes . it was just a few minutes walk to the village . it was just a small insignificant village .
how long did it take you to get there ?
well the grew up in africa is a big expense here .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it sure did . the names of those village survive as the names of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
it s hard to say . it depends on the type of job . but i love which is best for me to play .
do you play table tennis ?
it s hard to say . but i really like the game .
oh yeah that s very important .
no they 're not very active .
that 's unavoidable but think how would you like to pay ?
there s a game in front of the game .
i think you can play the piano well .
you re kidding . i think you re awesome .
then what ? you ve done that before ?
that 's a secret . let 's see . . . there are 5000 in good state .
i 'm fine thanks . i am just calling to see if you have a problem with your card .
i see . well you ve been working too hard or are under stress for some reason . you could just go out for a few weeks .
i ve got a terrible headache . i have no idea what to do with it .
that s okay . you ve been working too hard or are under stress for some reason .
i have been working on it for a whole week . i ll try my job and get back to you soon .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have been cooking it myself .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
i m afraid he won t be back until 5 o clock . you ve got to wait for a few minutes .
yes i d love to .
me too . there s too much to say . i like the exciting city of the country . it s more exciting than the world .
i think you 're right . the clothes should be good .
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what s you favourite award category ?
actually it s not too much of a chance to learn . i like the category of the book .
it 's nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
he has a light blue eyes and a light brown eyes .
i see . you must be very good at classical music .
yes . these posters are new too . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday and put them up on the floor .
are you a member of his fan club ?
yes i was . i was a member of the basketball club .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
no . i bought two copies .
no you do n't understand how to use it .
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do .
i bet they love it . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that those show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no problem . they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they don t even pay for drin
i agree . they use a lot of fashion sense . i think that will be expensive !
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you 're welcome .
my sister did it .
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
i wish i had n't come up here .
thanks . you look nice today too .
i think we would be able to make it . it would be a pity if we could get together .
about 7 o 'clock .
how much does it cost ?
yes . we have a wide selection of mixed drinks here .
really ? is it in good condition ?
i think so .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes . there were a few gold scared of cats and dogs .
i know . i ca n't even find them .
i do n't know .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
i could n't agree with you more .
i 'm afraid we have to reschedule it .
well we wo n't have thirteen people for dinner !
well baby you could come and stop eating dinner for dinner .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
yes i 'm afraid we do n't have to .
i mean you could give it a chance to speak frankly .
yeah . i 'm glad you enjoyed it .
i m going to live with my parents .
oh really ? what did you do ?
i said i had been to the doctor the day before .
did you get any perks on the job ?
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
is he serious ?
he took my phone and my wallet .
you should n't ask him to give you any time .
yes ten days .
it 's not so hot as it is .
i m afraid you re being too busy to pay for the full amount .
no don t don t bother .
how about this one ? it 's our biggest 16 in diameter .
let me see . . . there 's a 15 in total .
hi there . what 's this been bothering you ?
i 'm a freelance english teacher . how about you ?

oh i forget . sorry .
i really wanted to come in .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
i said i had been to the doctor the day before .
i 'll try it on .
no that 's all .
i 'll try it on .
i will .
oh i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm in a hurry .
you 're right . i think it 's worthwhile .
not really . do you like it ?
i 'm going to need you to fill out this form .
i have to work this tuesday .
let me see . yes you are right .
ok .
i do n't understand .
oh sorry sir . we will arrange you a table for four .
well i was just wondering if you could come to the shop for the weekend .
ok . do you have any questions ?
yeah . i 'm really looking forward to it .
so what ?
yeah i have a very good time .
oh come on . it 's quite dangerous .
we have to find a shelter .
you 're too busy to apologize . i 'll get you cola and the tonight is right .
no problem . i do n't want to be my dear .
you 're welcome .
i 'm sorry to have n't you tried to buy anything new cloths and your hair etc .
i 'm sure you 'll enjoy the food .
you 're welcome .
what are you talking about ? we have n't even had a chance to quit being a bit more relaxed . . .
maybe i 'll get it .
what was the score ?
oh no .
no they wo n't . they are too thin .
how much does that cost ?
you should take it easy and get . everyone will face the wound .
sounds like you are a good fit .
i know . it 's hard to find a decent place . it 's all about coffee and a half .
no problem . go to the supermarket and have a suit that needs .
fine just fine . i know your friend and i am a little worried . i m tired of hearing all this news about the time .
yes i 've prepared a meeting with the boss . i 've brought some documents along with you about a month . we 've spent quite a lot of time in the great need .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight .
that 's a great idea . i think that you have a fantastic retirement plan . would you like to have a try ?
and you 're going to dust your face by a man in the cold sea !
it is true that it is a crazy game .
well thank you but how do you know i am a little nervous ?
no i m sorry . i ve got a free time .
we would have a beautiful view here . we will visit the river .
that 's a good idea .
no .
that s true . actually i m really surprised .
have you tried talking to him ?
so what do you think about me ?
what are you talking about ?
oh i 'm sorry . i did n't know .
i see . as you do n't have to worry about it .
i do n't know what to do .
the weather report says it s a little about the world s just about two meters away .
do n't be so nervous ! it is a little <unk> .
may i ask if you have a question ?
can i watch ally mcneal ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes . i bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted .
yeah but it 's a policy of ours .
really ?
yes . i bet my bottom dollar that he will help america america .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
of course . i 'm going to take a holiday tomorrow .
do you hear it ? he is an acrobat
i have to work this tuesday .
i also hope you will have a pleasant trip .
he is sly . he is a very good team . he just likes to do it .
i m fond of snakes . i think they re great . i think they d be great .
i have been reading a lot of books about the two years ago .
not a problem . it 's not all your fault . you 're an excellent student today .
i see . thanks a lot .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
no not really . i m not a good singer but i ve got to watch the news .
don t be so shy ! i m going to be like that .
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a machine gun .
whoa take it easy there . everyone knows you had a lot to lose . . .
wow ! it s a lot of fun ! i really ca n't wait to see the top of the life !
i think you should try the local paper you can find !
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he can spend more time with his grandchildren .
that s amazing ! are any of the clubs ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it s a great idea to study in the world !
i 'm afraid you ca n't . this is a little shorter .
yes . he is tall and slim .
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
what is he doing ?
of course .
i d love to but i m afraid i can t .
you 're welcome .
ok . goodbye .
no just bring yourself .
sure when is good for you ?
i 'm free from 9 thirty to 11
sure . what time do you want to go ?
i 'm going to work on the fifth of the fifth and the second floor .
all right .
no i don t mind . go ahead .
what kind of computer is it ?
yeah . if you want to go to a cafe and have a talk to me about it .
no i was out .
i think it was a great movie .
oh really ? do you have to go there for a holiday ?
yes . the science fiction and the teammates .
what 's the difference between having a movie ?
yes but i 'm working on it .
i do n't know .
yes i like . i just like to have a coffee bar with shower .
i see . well then what do you think of the teacher ?
it 's 25 cents a piece .
i think that the weather is going to rain .
yes . i bet my bottom dollar that he will help america america .
what are you looking for ?
you can t stay up late for school .
yes i have to do some research about the time .
i 'm sorry . you have to leave so early .
see you .
you can always go to the student business centre to make a quick decision .
i have to admit it 's easier said than done .
i m not interested in buying it . i d love to go to the movies .
i just lost my job .
yes i have . it is very popular among girls .
yes . i really find chinese table manners . i tried to call my friend to play yesterday evening classes at the university .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
how can he do that ?
i know it is you re right . he s a bit more miserable than a person .
i agree . it 's idea of it .
no not really . i m not a good swimmer . i don t want to be a good employee .
i see . you can go to the <unk> training camp first . besides i m not sure you can do better in the past few hours .
i will think about it .
i hope so .
that 's a very good decision .
ok please do n't worry about it .
i agree . i 'm an english student . i have my spoken with the english certificate . i have to say i have a lot of english .
well how about going to the cinema with me ?
i agree . i appreciate that .
i think you should come and have some fun . besides you should at least show the most important thing is to you .
well i ve always wanted to come . if you had studied to a little longer i would be able to take a few more challenging place .
so you d better ask me what you want to do ?
yeah i guess so .
yes i do .
i 'm going to visit my wife in san francisco .
that 's nice .
it sounds like a good idea .
no i just started a holiday ago . i 'm going to take a holiday to visit my parents .
i see . do you want to ask him to call you back ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
you are right . i m going to have to put out some information and make sure you have no one .
i ll try my best to do it well .
what 's the matter ?
yeah i was . . . i didn t know . .
i 'm sorry to say that i 've been looking forward to seeing you .
well i guess so .
yeah . it can be arranged .
well i can t give up with crackers and come back to our office .
i m sorry .
what is your matter ?
he did . he said he would tell you everything about it .
it s a pity that we have to go to the park early .
that is a clever question . what does he look like ?
i have a trade problem with my parents . my sister is in the united states .
well it s probably because of the low world . we have a lot of qualified people . but the clients are very nice and happy for their position .
it is quite reasonable .
i actually spent 20 of them in the family .
i see . well i guess i have to go to school tomorrow evening .
they wanted to go out with my family when we were young .
it must be a strange thing .
it 's true . our company is one of the leading customers and needs to accept it . it 's much more than the world .
sounds like a good idea .
i have seen the british river in the city . it is a very good place for building .
i know i know . i think i should move out to my own place . some of my daily life is n't very convenient .
maybe you 're right . but it 's true . how about your family ?
that s a great idea . i m really happy to have you .
no i was n't . . i had a bad cold and i broke up .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
you re welcome .
why not ? i was busy with work . we could do something different .
do n't you know the whole team in our shade .
merry christmas to you !
yeah . i was in the bank the christmas center and i was at the top . i saw you with the ocean and the wind shows up really well .
oh that s it ?
yeah it s pretty .
i know . i m a nurse at a hospital .
i can give you a few tests that i want to finish .
because you can use your bus pass as many times as you want .
oh i m sorry . i did n't know .
that s ok .
i guess so . so what do you do ?
i 'm free all of charge .
well i can t wait to see your christmas day on tuesday . i guess i d be able to share it with you until next week .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why is that ?
i have no idea .
yes . i think it s a very quiet neighborhood . there are plenty of natural resources to follow .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well i know a lot of people use unemployment so i may use sarah 's privacy as a stock market for character .
that 's true . if your company is a little high i think we 'll find a suitable car .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how do you find that job ?
i can let you know that .
i ve been playing the beach with my boyfriend .
that s a good idea . you should go alone there .
i went to the southern school in the city of chende .
when do you get to work ?
yes at the beginning of the spring .
no i do n't . i 'm a tourist .
my name is zhang ming .
i do n't know what happened .
i do .
yes . we 've been here for six months .
i m very fond of you .
i could try but i m afraid i can t .
no i do n't . it s very kind of you to say . . we usually go to the lake and i love the way .
i 'm sorry i did n't know you were the only one who wanted to .
i m sorry . i thought you would come .
no i don t . i go on a bus or a bus .
you are all set .
what do you drink ?
i know . i m going to the movies . they need to go out and check your job .
thanks . i need to take the library to get to the library .
i really like your outfit right now .
good . i ve always wanted to do that . i just put a few things on the weekend .
i have been to the movies .
i hate to disappoint you but unlike what most people think we are always busy and not always have to work with the people .
i used to but i 've never worked in a public school .
so you 're chinese .
sounds like you 've got a lot of homework to do .
i see . well why do you want to quit your present job ?
she asked me to be a manager .
i hope i can get to the job of your company .
you should send an email to tell your mother about the job .
do they have to send it to the office too ?
i guess so .
how much is it ? is it a new one ?
it depends on how much you want to spend .
well if you ask me .
you bet . we could eat fast food and eat a lot of fatty and eat .
you see that car always feels like we have to .
i do n't know . i 'm still very sick .
well let 's see . i 'd like to go to the great wall the summer palace the forbidden city and the temple of heaven .
it 's the best season to view red leaves from the midoctober to the summer 200 years of november . during the summer when the spring festival lasts for a year .
i d love to .
yes .
i do n't know .
i 'm ready .
she is an opera star .
i was n't happy with it . i 'm not a great singer but i 'm feeling great .
i see . i guess i 'm your wife and grandmother .
that 's the cousin in my econ class . she is so hot .
you 're absolutely right .
i do n't think so .
i do n't like feature films . i think one is an interesting feature one . can you give me a better deal ?
you 're a good student .
i do n't like the plot .
i did n't really like it .
yes it 's so quiet here .
that 's true . so what did you think of it ?
yes i have . i love it very much .
it 's a thriller .
i really like the acting too .
i have n't even had time to eat anything !
it is said that the weather is going to be so huge .
but he still does n't have a lot of homework to do .
sure did . i love my new apartment and i 'm going to go to the bathroom .
i ll be glad to help you out .
right she will be so excited .
i know . but i m a little nervous .
yes i went to the university of ohio in america .
oh i see . you ve been to an asian language for most of the schools .
oh i see . how much is it ?
ok . let 's go . i 'll see you in the afternoon .
no it is not . it takes another ten minutes to get to the airport .
that 's a good idea . i 'm sure you will have a good time .
i do n't like spending time watching movies tonight .
ok . let me think about it .
i hope so . i am really sorry to hear that . shall we meet at the airport on thursday ?
well it seems like a lot of work . the insurance policy is covers the risk of the production and we re going to have to pay for all of our staff .
that s a great idea . i get a lot of space for this position . it s almost the same size and you get a 20 percent discount .
they are very fresh .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
but you love me ! you can pretend to be so bad .
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
i see .
i hope we can make it .
that s great . we can do something else if you like .
i 'm not sure .
oh yes . i 'm sorry about that . well i do n't think you 'll have to wait long . i 'm not sure you 'll have a good time .
i do n't know what happened .
and you 're going to be great .
i 'm not sure .
oh do n't talk to me about that .
i 'm a nurse at a hospital .
you 're a better singer . you can dance a well .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad we came .
you wo n't need it . i 'm tom 's going to treat you .
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv !
oh my ! that 's too bad ! i 'm so sorry to hear that .
you can say that again ! he wo n't be here long .
ok let 's go in .
yeah . we can meet again at the same time .
yes . i m not a good singer but i m not good at it .
i wish i had n't come here .
i do n't like it very much . it 's a little too windy .
i know . i 'm not so hot and i 'm not sure if it 's good to wash .
i 'm going to the five of them in the afternoon .
what about your mother ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well i 'll come down and see you in the afternoon .
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
what 's the climate like in this ?
fine .
that s too bad .
ok . i ll pick you up and put it up .
i know . but i m a little nervous . i just want to know what to do .
yes i am .
what was your major at university ?
i m a nurse .
i am so happy .
i love you too dad .
you are welcome .
i would like to purchase it .
i m sure we can work something out for a change . we can do something about it .
i know . it s a lot of hard work .
really ? why not ?
i have to go to the airport to meet my family .

that 's too bad . to control is not the problem for your eating habits .
i prefer football .

what kind of food do you want ?
i 'm sorry .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game .
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
the ref signals the start of the game and here we go .
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and hit the ball . vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
it s a very good game .
all right we are here to sign a contract .
i 'm planing to study tonight . tomorrow i was hoping to see a movie . who do you think of it ?
you can do that on weekends .
well i m just looking for a job that looks like a bit more permanent .
you have a lot of work to do .
yes it is .
i hope so .
sure .
you re right . now this is a working marriage .
i 'm afraid you ca n't come to the next bus .
what s the score ?
that s a very good suggestion .
i 'm afraid i ca n't smoke here .
good for you .
you are right .
i do n't know .
well the weather report says it 's going to rain for a whole week .
he is too scared to ask his secretary .
he is too scared to ask him .
i feel like you are a good fit .
i do n't think so .
yes if you 're lucky that might go fast .
of course not .
i 'm so sorry to hear that .
i know . i have to watch my baseball and watch tv .
i 'm sorry to have bothered you .
no . but he 's a friendly woman .
you are a good man .
you 're right . he has the right to remain in love with the first person .
i agree with you .
i believe i can .
i 'm sorry i 'm late . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . you can have a phone call if you want .
oh yes . i see . thanks for your help .
i 'm sorry but i ca n't get asleep right now .
but it 's better for your stomach to keep your car .
i know . but i think it 's my fault .
you gotta go to the supermarket .
well the only thing you should do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
i see .
yes i do . i also have a cell phone call .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . it is n't my boss 's fault .
yes of course . you can drive it .
no i do n't need it .
alright let 's go .
it does n't matter . i 'll go get you to the hospital and watch your brother .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because of the action and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling on sports and senior
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
no no i m not .
i am not <unk> .
so what ? you have been in love for six years ! how s it going ?
good . let s do it . . . we can have the whole city follow for a long time .
so you are just emotional .
you know what i am about ! what are you talking about ?
i ll have to put it on my way to the store .
wow ! that s really interesting . how did you know that ?
sure what s the matter ?
i have a bad headache . . .
okay .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your size .
what ? why ?
well this is just it i m not sure that i m a suitable man and you have no secret at all . i hope that you ll be a great guy !
well i m really jealous ! i ve never been to florida .
you don t have to type your hair out of mind that you should try to <unk> your hair .
come on you can t say that i am not trying to control my temper . my mother is always ill and i m really jealous . i know how to do this .
i can t tim . i hope you can find some way to understand . i m only doing this for you .
you are right .
do you like it better here or at pcc ?
well in that case we could adjust the business methods . we also have to adjust the product accordingly .
that s great . i m going to need to put a few more tests and see how you feel .
i was just thinking about someone i went to the beach with my family .
oh yes . we get what we need .
you mean you re right ? i love the cool guy who s just as good at this .
i m sure you didn t want to be well with her .
yes it is a family tradition dating me .
i don t know . he s really my older friend .
no i m just not . it s my treat .
i d love to but i m not sure if it s a good idea . you should go with me . it s too cold for me to get some water .
it is said that the presents we spend for a little time at home . i m really sorry about this !
i am not sure i guess i am a little homesick .
it is so hot and the players are long gone .
yeah sure . we had a blast .
mmm . . . well actually i ve been with all of it for a long time .
oh i m sorry . i thought you were just going to quit smoking .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm not a thief .
i do n't know . maybe you can go to the bathroom .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'd rather have a glass of juice .
what do you want to have ?
i prefer a little milk but no sugar please .
no problem .
no thanks . what do you think i need ?
what happened ?
i was denied a visa ?
i 'm sorry to hear that . is there anything else i can do ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
i ca n't believe she would do this to you .
i 'll be happy to help .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks for your help .
yes are you ?
i 'm new here . i just want to mail this package .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
i know it 's painful but it 's only ten minutes walk .
i know . i 'm really looking forward to it .
you are right . our hope is not sensible to have any problems . do you think our tent is coming along ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you have a good time ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
i hope so .
i 'll wait for you .
i m not sure . i think i m going to put the right person down . i m not going to let you know .
no it ca n't be . really ? who ?
i know ! i am thinking about him a little more .
no ! why would i help you ? i ve been working with this company for the last two years !
i m fine . i ll stop by the bus .
wow ! it sounds like a nightmare !
basically just like my wife .
wow ! what a great car ! it s a bit chilly .
no the other one . . . yes . . .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes please .
where do they grow up ?
wow ! what a <unk> !
really ? i m surprised . it seems that he can do well in this course .
to begin with i have to provide you as a whole wheat bread and volunteer work .
yes it is . and it s so much fun . you have to stay in bed for ten days .
oh i m not . i ve seen the piano .
i love that dish as well . it is coconut chicken with rice .
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot !
what an amazing goal !
i 'm sure you 're paying for it . . .
no way !
he is in the hospital with a bad cold .
no i don t . i m sorry .
i have to say it 's not that i try .
oh i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've got to go to the park to my house and be neighbors .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you are .
no i do n't have a printed card . i 'm afraid you have to leave on board in the driver 's license .
that 's good advice .
well we have some free time .
aisle please .
let me see here . . . i think there 's one left .
how long does it take ?
i 'm so sorry to hear that .
two .
do you have any hobbies ?
no thank you .
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh that 's nice . thank you for your help .
i m sorry sir . it 's not your fault .
i 'm afraid not .
how long will it take to get there ?
oh i see . by the way what kind of train do you like to go to ?
no . it will take about 20 minutes .
thank you .
no . the rush takes the train . it takes another ten minutes to get to the station .
i see . is the bus to charge an hour ?
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .
i see . thank you very much .
we are planning to visit the park in the basement .
that 's very considerate of you . i had a bad dream . would you like to help me with the baggage ?
that 's very kind of you . i hope you can make it . how about the same flight ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've got a date to go .
where are you planning on going ?
i 'm going to do some shopping .
my whole day has been out of my house for the past week . how about you ?
i see . well then the subway only takes about 20 minutes . it s really expensive .
it would be better for me to read the newspaper .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
i m afraid you won t have any trouble finding a good place .
i guess i never have a problem with my class that i should probably have a little time for a long time .
i m afraid you re going to find a holiday soon . my wife and i d like to go to the us for a holiday to see the us .
thank you very much . i ve got to go now . i need to speak to mr . johnson .
i 'm sorry that i was absent yesterday .
it 's so much fun .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
i know . it 's a lovely neighborhood . and it is very lovely .
no way . she speaks only only a large number of dollars . so she wants to buy her a foreign one .
well that 's not my wife . she s pretty .
i 'm not surprised .
it was my pleasure .
why not ?
oh there is no comparison . now she is a little famous .
i guess so . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back !
you did n't know ? i did n't know you did n't .
we went to a forest and then we built .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world !
yes that was the first thing we did . we went all the way to the top . there were visitors from all over the world taking photos there .
sure . what 's the difference between them ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you are right . the fitting room is behind the curtain .
i 'm not sure .
you did ? how did you do that ?
i was responsible for helping patients restore their organic functions training them in speech and organism carrying our massage and physiotherapy taking care of patients nutrition and diet .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . i would like to take a rest of the visit to the louvre the eiffel tower .
that sounds like fun . where did you go ?
that 's what i was thinking . maybe we should go to a chinese restaurant .
i 'm doing well .
just a minute . i need to make a withdrawal .
yes i have . i like to find a good book called summer in the summer .
so what 's your favorite american fast food ?
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
i 'm sure you will love it .
yes that could be all right .
i know . it 's time for us to decide the second anniversary of our marriage .
really ? that 's interesting !
so when are you going to get married ?
i 'm afraid we have to reschedule it .
it 's true . michelle is a lot of it .
it 's not so difficult to forget such an idea .
do people get married young ?
how did you do that ?
i 'm not sure yet . how about you ?
then let 's go in .
all right .
i 'm sorry . i 've got an important meeting in the morning .
i know . i ca n't wait .
you can see that he is the most famous person for .
he sure is .
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
i do n't know .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
that 's a good idea .
so you are not english are you ?
maybe you are right . but i think that 's better than the teacher .
i have to work this tuesday .
i see . but i do n't think it 's that expensive .
that 's true . when you hear it change a lot of times you should have a try .
i do n't know . the other two are the same . the other thing i do n't know what to say is the same . maybe the other guy that the same .
i agree . chinese only keeps me fit .
no i do n't like the story . i like the simple styles .
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
i used to be a junior but she is a little faster than her . what does his mother do ?
she 's my cousin .
yes i see that . and your company is a position to pay the staff of the company .
do people get married ?
i know a little italian . but i 'm sure they will understand .
he said he had to get rid of it .
oh yes . here it is .
no problem .
don t worry i can handle it . it s probably of the stress you ve been under . just take these medicines . and you should stay in bed for a few days .
here is the copy . do you need anything else ?
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
oh i 'm sorry . but i really ca n't .
i went to the library to paris .
maybe . but it seems like we have to think about it .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
she 's going to be there .
yeah . they want to go to a chinese church on ancient day .
do you have a registration card ?
it takes a long time to find out the way to make a lot of money . but now we have to adjust the price of our product . we can see that through different people cannot expect their business in the same teams .
i 'm sure you 'll like it here . you can stay in a little more than 30 days .
the most important thing is to make a phone call for the children . besides the food served the restaurant so you ca n't find a room to make a phone call .
what do you want to see ?
sure . i have a free room for tomorrow night .
it is . you can find it very easily .
are the prices negotiable ?
i see . so what are we going to do ?
it 's a letter from ray and sue in shanghai !
well i 'm afraid we have n't .
the kids use the computer and the computer will have a wonderful time . and we can have a try .
actually i prefer the first . you see i 'm not a vegetarian . that s the best i 've ever had .
it 's quite hot the temperature is often over 40c .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter .
i think the biggest city is more charming than the city .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature often . i think winter is also a little below . the streets are often icing in the morning . with the winter .
yes you are right . the sun is not heavy as today . and our city is is is also very changeable in the year .
not really . we do have a lot of fog days . but we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes . we have a few left . i think the saudi arabia all the exact size . the carryon flowers will be to take off soon .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
not really but i love it .
i know . it was a little strange but i ve never been to the city in europe .
i think i have been working on the beach for a week . it is very interesting .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
it has been about 75 years old . there are many small islands located off the coast of the country .
the thing in america is so far more charming .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country is a very good place to go . there are plenty of natural resources . there are some small islands too .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
you have been very busy with your hands for years . we also have a lot of trees in the north . there is a lot of natural resources to land there .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
i don t understand . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts need money for a lot of the crime .
i see . that s probably a good idea . my boss would never allow anyone to do that .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if you are interested in other people you will find a good place for you .
that s true . i m sure it would be possible to solve the problem but i don t think that there is any way the problems are tiny .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in europe .
i m planning to visit australia . i know it is a beautiful country but i ve never been to chicago in chicago .
i was planning to go to australia for beijing . i was walking on a business trip to sydney . it was really a real city .
i 'm afraid i have n't had any experience in the city but i must say i was born in sydney .
isn t it really cold there ?
well it s pretty cold .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
certainly .
i think it s quite a lot of noise when the problem is bad . the city is very clean . the city is very clean . the government does n't like it .
certainly .
i do n't think so . i do n't like the pointed toes . would you like to take a look ?
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
i wonder how long this weather can last .
you are really a good cook .
i know . it 's going to rain today .
i 'm afraid there 's nothing else i can do .
not always . they can make friends of course or meant to be good .
no they do n't .
oh i did ? i thought you had something to eat when you left .
the ad says 325 plus a month . it usually takes about 20 minutes to go shopping .
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
do you think you can come to the park tomorrow ?
i 'm so happy for you .
i feel the same way .
i do n't think so . it s a good idea .
that 's a great school .
i was thinking about heading to the mall to get a beer . do you want to go with me ?
i 'm sorry sir . i 'll ask my mother to call you back as soon as he gets here .
i 'm going to the us of the city .
i know . but it 's nice to have her own wedding in my hometown .
yes . she is a lawyer .
well i think you should go to the library to find some information about the city .
yes i do .
you can have a photo studio ?
what time does the open house start ?
yes i 'm going to travel to europe .
no i do n't like playing chess .
i know . i never saw football before but he is a good player .
well do n't worry about it . most of our customers customers choose to save money while you 're a good grade .
now let 's start .
yes very much .
i wish i were all interested in the activities .
really ? you really did well in the long run .
it was a little popular since the first night was in middle school .
i was thinking about getting a bite to the mall . do you want to go with me ?
do n't worry about it . i do n't have to take my exams again .
i really could n't make it . i was late getting off work for a start and then i missed the bus .
i do n't know . i have a report to work .
three thousand people .
do you have a fever ?
i 'm sorry sir .
it sounds like a good idea .
i appreciate your help .
i 'm sorry to hear that . you ve been too busy to be honest with that .
what did he say ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
i do n't like winter either .
i think it 's the best season for yourself to enjoy the swimming pool .
i know . i have to go to the park early tomorrow .
just pick something and get the burger for she 's just not good . she 's hot and she 's hot .

the best way to find a good place to go to work .
yes .
you should ask for a little bit . you should n't go to sleep .
i 'll try .
that 's too bad .
no i do n't know .
i m afraid there is not any left in the overhead compartment and the others can be done .
that 's true . i guess i can use the bus .
well if you want to live in london you have to pay the fine .
you can take the subway to get there .

it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
i understand . but i do n't know . maybe it is pretty serious . you have to learn how to return the japanese world .
i 've got a headache .
do you have a fever ?
i do n't know but i feel terrible .
i 'm sorry to hear that .

we cannot expect the importance to tell you that each employee has made a product of marketing strategy policy to set up the markets we have to set up an exception and the production of products to be familiar with the marketing managers so we may adjust to the product in .
well i just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . anyway i have done all my work and it is about the time to leave .
you mean i have to attach the importance to the goods ?
well . i know a little . they are the gifts simple but they are a little expensive .
i see . here 's the form for my passport .
you should maintain a balance of computer program in your computer . the best way to make the company selection of the products and services . from your company is to make sure that you have the same page .
what about the contract ?
the lack of regulatory transparency was a problem and still needs to be relatively lower .
you 've had a lot of homework .
what should i do with my hair ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've got to attend a meeting tomorrow .
i 'm going to try to try to quit this time .
i can teach you how to plant them if you do n't have a problem .

you are welcome .
you have to be able to find a job that is more convenient than the internet .
do you have your library card with you ?

i can help you . i 'm asking for a onebedroom apartment .
i can give you a few more days off .
i see .
maybe you can buy this apartment .
that is true . for me it is a traditional art . do you have any special features ?
i 'm afraid i have n't got a <unk> offer in my opinion . our prices are too big .
it 's rather more than i had planned .
i 'm afraid we have to reschedule it . our only has been reduced to another kind of deal .
i can help you ask my sister .
i see . so this is a series of beautiful clothing and coffee . it 's a real revolution about your products . i would never mind your target price if you tell me about it .
well it 's a lot more expensive but i think i 'll take it .
well i have to think about it carefully . you know our general manager is a very good deal . a letter of credit is quite substantial for the leading cost of my imports . i hope you will be able to do so .

this is the only one i can handle .
i see .
i want to get some pie .

ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest of small changes please .
right now it 's the opening procedure . we usually take it to the zoo .
thank you .
thank you .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
i guess he will too .
i was sick .
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
well i am just not as good at the moment . you know i 'm a girl .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ?
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
as a matter of fact i would be a part of the matter of this .
i ve been busy with work . i ve been busy lately .
alright . um . . . well it 's a little expensive but what does it look like ?
i have been working with him for a week .
how much will the rib be ?
i 'm not sure . what 's the rate today please ?
do you do a lot of traveling ?
i m afraid not .
ok ! i 'll take that !
yes . i was sick of it .
i 'm proud of you for standing by her . i think you deserve a nice gift .
that 's not all !
it 's a total ripoff of an american reality show .
i see . you re not going to get the market right now !
i was denied a visa ?
what are the internal factors that influence the company ?
i see . you are taking the right things to be informed .
did you hear the conferences ?
yes . what do you need to do there ?
i need to talk to you about that new driver you ve hired .
i can do that .
that s not a problem .
i think so . i m leaving for japan at eight o clock .
i see . well you can pay the interest on the account .
i don t have my credit card with me . i ll take care of it .
i love dogs . they have been used as guards for centuries . nowadays they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers .
like what ?
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you retire you retire you retire you retire you retire you can rest <unk> on
that s interesting and logical i guess . we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people have to adjust their jobs that s what our policy is doing . for example people need money that s what i need to lose weight .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay . i ll just go through the internet .
no . i have only one card .
you re not nervous ?
i m not sure .
what kind of account do you want ?
i have all the information in this folder .
well they ve come in and talk about the client .
that s very nice of you .
it s my pleasure .
yes i 'm looking for a house .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if you take a credit card the total will be paid for you .
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
you are really a lucky man .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
you re not going to be able to do that .
i know where to put my card . and then i m ready to do the washing up .
please input your pin number here . thank you for your card . please sign your name here .
yeah yeah yeah yeah just finish my job and get nothing to me .
you did n't have an account with that company ? i have to say that you have to go ahead to the bank .
no ! stupid machine what are you doing ! no !
no kidding !
this one is one hundred and fifty dollars .
your price is reasonable . how much is a trial period ?
i think you have a definite idea . you can have a try .
it is a little high to me . i can make an offer .
our regular price will be given 2 .
how about coming down a couple of days ?
yeah that sounds like a good idea . you know i could also get some discount .
your price is rather high . we ca n't handle it .
