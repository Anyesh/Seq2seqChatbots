you are lucky .
i will try my best .
well the subway is a bit faster but it will be cheaper .

yes ! i just checked in and there s a chance that could happen .
what was the problem ?
no kidding !
also some of the dirty clothes and the government also have to keep them with it .
i am afraid it is not the right problem . the security is much easier to get used to that problem .

i do n't think so .
you are welcome .
i do n't know .

you can eat a large seed but you do n't have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the difference between these mangoes ?
well it 's a little different from our old price .

it s a very difficult drive . the train is about to get a mile from the highway to the right .
that s a lot of money !
it s a fruit and a lot of big seed in it . it s a small town but it s not very big deal .
now far from the last question . what is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?
it 's not too much . just a regular price .
but what can i do ?
well we have a lot of training problems . i can assure you that our apartment is on sale is down so we ll have to deal with some new furniture .
i 'm not sure .
how many people will be traveling around the world .
i know ! i just got back from home and found a couple of weeks ago ! it s gonna be fun !
i m actually thinking of completely <unk> the kitchen and getting a new stove oven dishwasher a trash compacter .
that s a good idea . the kitchen looks great . the kitchen god is very old .
yes sir . what size do you wear ?
i 'm sorry sir . i ca n't finish typing it .
sure .
it sounds like a pretty far from home but it 's far from home .

it feels all right . but i like it better than it 's a bit of a bed .
it 's only 29 . 95 .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you .
i 'm afraid not . you can trust that .
i 'm afraid not sir . i 'm afraid there 's a bit of a problem .
i think we can find something nice in the city .
yes it 's pretty bright .
you 're right . it 's so romantic .
it 's a well furnished eatin kitchen . the stove and the icebox are in good order and the plumbing is ok too .
that 's true . the bathroom plumbing is also a little tight . is it convenient to take place to make a large selection ?
the toilet flushes and the shower has hot and cold .
are there many problems with the kitchen in the kitchen ?
yes . we have some that are on sale now .
what about these ?

i 'm glad to be of help .
yes .
our first year of our services we have a broad selection of various sizes . for example we offer a starting salary for one month .
the delivery date was for a problem .
i know . but we cannot expect him to make such a boss decision .
you 're right . you 'll never guess . you 're right . you 'll be my girlfriend . i 'll go to the hospital with you .
i think you should have a try someday .
you can buy them if you buy me a souvenir !
if you buy a prepaid phone card you can be assured of that .
that 's a good idea ! you just cut the price into it and make it thin crust .
i 'll take it . thanks for your help .
i 'm not disciplined enough i guess .
yes . there are many websites about that . i can email them to you .
that 's good . i 'll take one .
i think it 's worth trying .

that 's a good idea .
they can enjoy themselves in the world without one else and will offer you a discount .
well there are two types of job search . this is a really good company .
that 's a good idea . what about supply ?
maybe that would be a shame .

that 's a lot of money ! you just need to cut out your price and we ll replace it .
i do n't like it . i 'm not a good singer but i do n't know what to do .
how much did it cost ?
you should try to put your best foot forward and be careful .
i 'm not really sure . i just want to make a few more money .
it 's not just spreading out to the websites .
well i guess you 're right . i 'll see that they 've got to get another one .
yes . i 've been busy with a job for two years .
i ca n't wait to play it well . i 'll be able to sing all night .
well i 'll see you tomorrow then .

i m not sure . i d like to have a look at the newspaper .
where do you want to go ?
i 'd like to go to the railway station please .

hi . this is mick . there is no response to the problem .
no .
i 'm sorry sir . i 'll check it .

i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon .
that 's fine .
see you tomorrow .
yes i 'm glad to help you . what kind of apartment do you need ?
i like the fact that i go shopping there but i do n't think they are going to spend a lot of money on the street .
well i think you can find a place that is better for your health .
i hope so . i am not in the mood for traveling abroad . i am not sure i can do that .
i see . that 's why we have everything here . we 've just started a new apartment for you .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
yes . i 'll call the manager and tell you what .
ok .

i would like to make a deposit .
i 'm sorry . mr . li is in a meeting right now . can i take a message ?
i 'm sorry . i 'll call him and discuss it for you .

ok . bye .
ok .
you can get that type of apartment out of the rent .
yes it 's really convenient and the subway is often icy .
is there a problem ?
it s not usually included so you ll find a house nearby .
that 's a lot of money .
that 's true . but i think it 's worth trying to get more money .
i agree . it is not the easy color to make . you know the market is much more expensive than the old people will think it s worth it .
i know . i ca n't stand it anymore . it 's not like i can do anything about it .
well i guess i do n't have the chance but i do n't think i can afford the subway if you want to take the subway .
i usually buy a car if i m not a bad drinker .
do you have a lot of money ?
i think that the idea is that there are some people who are looking for the apartment on the edge of the rent .
where did he go ?
he was in his late place .
i do n't know what to say !
i do n't know .
you can never do that . he is always a really good friend .
i do n't think i can get the right now .
that 's a good idea .
well i think we should save more money .
hi ! i have n't seen you for ages .
hi jim !
i 've got it there . thanks for your help .
i am doing great .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .

well i am really looking forward to working with you .
ok .
i 'm serious .
i 've been looking for a job for a year now .
no double a <unk> .
he 's a <unk> professional and a teamplayer . i do n't think he can do well in that area . i have the right to work that needs .
what does she look like ?
yeah i 'm not really hungry .
that 's a good idea . he has a rough idea of how much he can make .
i 'm sorry . i ca n't help you .

i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've got to go now .
hi ! i would like to have some money made and withdrawal withdrawal .

yes . this is what is called road rage .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area .
i am afraid i ca n't agree with you there .
i think so . you should try to put your best foot forward and put it in front of you .
what are you talking about ? you can t just take me to the side of the road .
i m glad to hear that !
what 's the difference ?
ok . let s go !
well i guess i was being too shy ! i just ca n't get some old stuff that are n't tough .
i 'm not really into the mood for it .

i 'm looking for a sweater for my girlfriend .

i m fine . i need a new car . i need a new one .
what did you buy ?
oh i see . well you have to take the original state of the ancient greece .
i 'm afraid not . i 'm looking for a sweater .
i think you 're a real bargain .
so you must be careful .
it looks like it 's getting cold .
you can buy an expensive expensive battery . you can use it .
hey ! you 're really strongwilled .
that means that an <unk> man is <unk> a large idea .
what 's the difference between these annoying rates ?
i 'm not sure . i think i 'll look for something else .
it s a problem .
i m sorry sir . i m going to have to take a look inside your bag .
i m starving ! what do you think of it ?
you 're welcome .
i need to get a passport .

i know where this is going . how much do i need to get a new computer ?
it 's free of charge .
i see . by the way what is this made of ?
i m not looking forward to it ! let s do it !
ok . i will send the colors to you as soon as possible .
yes it does . look at these styles . they are very simple and simple . it has a builtin <unk> memory .
now that i know what you mean . i will just cut down on the skin . do you have any ideas ?
it 's a little complicated but it 's a little complicated . you have to put it in a couple of minutes .
okay . i ll just keep it in mind .
yes it is . look at these two watches too ! they are much <unk> and can t stay in shape .
i ll just have it ready for you now .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
i know . i was pretty upset about it .
well i guess you 're right . i just lost my wallet .
i can take the survey online . it was n't that easy . damn it ! i 'm afraid i ca n't finish writing this paper .
i 'm sorry . i did n't know you did n't . i just lost it .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
i know . i think the marketing is worth the compensation .
i 'm going to put it on the table sam .
i think you 'll enjoy the food .
it 's about 3 kilometers .
i 'm afraid you ca n't . i 'm going to have to work tomorrow .
yeah i guess so . i do n't know why i can change this job . i do n't think it 's just that the right places are to be taken .
i 'm sorry . you did n't know that you did n't do anything .
thanks . i 'll do that .
it 's a great idea . i ll go to the supermarket .
ok . i 'll see you tomorrow then .
that sounds great . where did you learn it ?
i 'm not in the mood for it .
i 'm sorry . i ca n't . i 'm going to take the exam .

that 's right .
i 'll try .
i 'd like to buy some rib for my collection .
what kind of job are you looking for ?
i want to look at the computer and get rid of the internet that is possible to get rid of channels that it 's really convenient to be convenient for me .
well you can download a cd from the bar . it 's a popular movie . it has a builtin <unk> memory and a connection with a connection speed of free memory .
do you have to pay an installation fee ?
you can buy the first break .
awesome ! i m going to go get the bank right now !
yes i did .
i m sorry sir but this was the first time i was really gonna catch the road .
it s a pleasure to have you studied in the united states . it s not an easy job . there are several possible sources of cash and perhaps you can put up for a small business suite .
i am not surprised you know the feeling . it took me to the beach with the birds and squirrels . i am not so scared of the sunshine .
that s great . thank you very much .
it sure is . but it costs 200 dollars .
it 's pretty . i think the color is ok . do you have any in a size ?
i m not sure . i ll take it .
yes . i ve got two double roses and a roses .
i like spring too . how about this one ? it s very hot and the weather is very nice .

oh i m sorry . i ve already got a credit card .
i m sorry sir . you re going to have to take your credit card .
it 's not really all that great . it 's a lot better than mine .
i know . i could get a look at the bank at it .
i 'm afraid not . you 'd better get up or you 'll simply need to improve your english .
i think so . it 's probably the weather that is better than the summer in winter .
you 're right . the special effects are becoming double and well done .
it s a great idea . the rent was very good .
it sure is . the view is spectacular . but the bedroom is worth it .
i think that we should probably get more . we could get some exercise in a few days .
i think that we can find something similar at .
i am happy to hear that .
i m glad to hear that .
you can only pay 725 a month .
that s too expensive .
how much money can i go to the movies ?
i m glad to hear that .
that s a good idea .
that s a good idea .
that s a good idea .
i didn t know you liked mysteries but i don t think i ve seen anything like that .
i m afraid not . i ll be able to do it .
it 's very nice of you to say so . i love it .
i think you should try some new food . it s very delicious . you can find some tasty and cook .
i ll put the plates and cutlery away as i dry them . where is the tea towel ?
i know you are a good cook for me . i will take it .
well i like chinese food . i 'm not sure . i 'll just eat it .
that s a great idea . you ve got a great cook .
i do n't like it but i usually cook it . i usually only cook it for lunch on the other day .
yeah you can find hundreds of chinese culture if they like it .
i think about it a month .
ok . do you want a large one or an electric one ?
i think i 'll need a new brand .
i think that one fits me well . how about the brown one ?
i think that is the best price we can offer .
i m afraid you re going to be too expensive for me .
thank you for your compliments . you are a good leader .
yes . that s why i bought some ring from them . after that i can get rid of them . they also have to buy synthetic products .
i 'm not sure . what 's the difference between american and american styles ?
here you are .
i 'm not sure .
i m sure you ll enjoy your stay in this room .
thank you .
this is he .
i 'm looking for a job .

i think that 's a bad idea . i just need a few more of it .
i see . do you have any ideas which one do you prefer ?
i think you are right .
well i think you should try to reduce your price by 5 percent .
i 'll take a try .
yes we do .
i think you can choose from one of the another .
i 'm sorry . i 'll try it .
why ?
oh i know . i know a place that is a little far away from home but i 'm sure you can do it .
well i 've never had a better job . i 'll have to take a look at it .
where is that ?
i really like that house .
i do n't know .
that is a great idea .
yes it did . we bought a lot of things from it .

i like the fish .
certainly . you can bring some of your present knowledge and if you like i can invite you to some music .
well i do n't know . i 'm in a mood for some kind of vegetable . but i do n't know what other dances like .
that 's right . you should go to the gym to the gym after breakfast .
thank you .
i 've heard that before . do you like our thai food or seafood restaurant ?
that 's a good idea . i 'll have them bought for you .
you are not really chubby . you are actually thin enough .
well first you should buy a bottle of moisturizer . you can go to the supermarket and buy some of the <unk> .
well we have a couple of different things . we should consider giving you a couple of days . do you have any idea of getting a big family ?
i think i will try this one . it is always the best in this world .
ok . i know where that is .
you can always take it again .
and what is your nationality ?
you 're welcome .
i do n't think so .
i do n't know .
i think the best way to reduce the price by 5 percent .
i know . i 'm really sorry . but i must say that the prices are higher than other companies .
when do you close ?
they are all here .
i know . i think i can find something that i want to buy .
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
i think so .
yes . i 'll be there around 6 .
it 's a great idea .

you know that i have no appetite but i do n't think that there 's any kind of bad news for me .
my pleasure ! this tea towel s a little ragged . do you have another one ?
what ? you are you doing anything !
i know . i think that maybe they should try to reduce their price to make sure they are neat and <unk> .
i feel like having a little trouble .
ok i 'll keep that in mind .
i am afraid not . i can t .
i do n't like talking to you about it .
i really like this meal ! it 's so beautiful !
i usually go to the cafeteria .
yeah you are right . i ll start work hard at that time .
yeah i know . i have to admit that i 've been going to make every day .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like . classical music might make you clever but dance might make you livelier and happier .
well i like to eat a lot of dumplings and then drink more of alcohol .
haha . i have no idea . for the most beautiful drinks of the time of all the time we have for a dinner of our family in the kitchen .
i do n't like it but i do n't mind it .
do you have any idea how many people are there in your house ?
it 's fine . i 'll have some salmon sashimi and a roast salmon head .
yeah you are right . i have to admit that i never tasted anything like it . i always wanted to have indian food so i could use chicken or thai food .
i like the fish .
i 'm prepared to do the meeting right now .

no . you 'd better not cry or you 'll have a glass of water for the rest of your stomach .
no thanks . i 'm not really in the mood for some kind .
i do n't think so . you 'd better give up the medicine . it 's the medicine for the doctor 's doctor . you 'll need to take it .
that 's right . all right . you have a good taste in your mind .
i do n't like museums . they re boring .
sounds like a good idea . i 'll get a bottle of perfume and a chocolate shake .
i 'd love to !
i 'm not sure yet . i 'm not sure what i want to do .
i do n't know . i do n't know what to get for a pizza !
i 'd love to . i 'm really not sure .

i like the wine . i ll take it .
i hope you like it .
well we can give you some advice . you can get some sound sound financial guarantee .
ok . i can peel the vegetables . and they 're the chips .

how about the rice ?
no thanks . i 'll have a cup of tea .
i 'd rather have a hamburger please .
yes i do . i have to remain at home tonight .
i 'm not sure . i 'm going to have a lot of trouble .
i know . i 'm going to go out to the store .
i 'm not going to cook tonight .
i 'm not sure . i know a place that is ok .
i do n't know . i have no appetite .
i think i 'll have a dish of vanilla ice cream .
i 'll have a sandwich and some chili sauce .
i do n't like cooking but i do n't mind cooking .
i 'm not sure . i just want to try something .
i 'm going to go home and get a burger and some food .
i 'm so sorry .
i 'll have a diet coke please .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you .
i 'll have a diet coke .
what kind of soda do you want ?
i 'll have a glass of wine then .
i do n't know .
i 'll have a glass of wine then .
i 'm not sure . i just have a beer and soda .
i 'm not going to put this off any longer casey ! i want to see you .
i 'm afraid you ca n't .
i 'm not sure . i have no idea what i want .
you do n't have to eat a lot of vegetables .
i like apple pie .
you can eat a lot of them .
you can see that one hand over the world . you can see that one that looks like you have to buy .
you can eat a lot of fruits and vegetables and vegetables .
you can buy them if you like .

here you are .
yes they are very fresh .
you can eat a lot of them .

come on . you are my lifesaver .
i think you are a good friend . i would feel the idea of having a conversation with me .

well the reason is that there is a possibility of giving the advantage of a general manager . so you can speak english conversation and other things .
i think i know that . i think it 's realistic .
it 's a book that i can give you a free drink .

the inspection is usually the same as the damage .

i think you should try to put in the other day and try to get some more information .
i do n't know . i do n't know . i do n't like it but i do n't know how much i should do .
it is . it 's hard to believe that it is better than the old vaccines .

i 'm glad to meet you .
i can ask you if you like .
i do n't think so . i saw her down the street you know . i fell in love with her at first sight .
i think it happened last night .
i 'm sorry to hear that . but i think you 've seen her before .
yes i do .
i did n't think it was a good idea .
the notebook is a big fan of him .
he was messing around last week .
it is really a beautiful country . you certainly have been expecting this for a long time .

yes i agree . i 'll go and watch it .
it 's a bus station .

i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've got to go now .
the morning will be fine .
oh come on ! you 're going to be my masterpiece !
i think i 'll take the bus .
i think that i 'll see you tomorrow then .
and now you 're ms . wilson ?
oh my god ! i just bought a new one last year . it 's really nice to have a big dance .
i hope so .
that 's so unfair .
it 's a romantic party . it 's the best season for the world .
what time is the wedding going to be there ?
i know you are absolutely right .
so what do you drink ?
they are attending an evening course in the united states .
oh no ! they are killing me !
really ?
it 's a pleasure to have my own business .
i think so .
what a pity !
i 'm glad you like it .
i 'm not sure .
i see .
it 's a piano solo . i 'm fond of piano you know .
i do n't think it 's that serious . it 's absolutely absolutely absolutely possible to get a picture of my old stuff in japan .
yes it is . and it 's also located in the opposite part of the city .
wow ! what else do you use to get ?
i would like to have a shave for my son .
that 's a good idea . you have a good memory .
you should take it from the library .
in the beginning of the month .
that 's a good idea .
well i think we should go out for a picnic .
thank you .
you can ask him out of the way .
thank you . i am very excited about the olympic games .
but the price will be negotiable .
it 's 1 dollars .
that sounds nice .
yes i 'm going to do that .
yes . if you want to go to the bank account you can get a monthly savings account and a savings account .
i 'm not really in the mood for dancing actually . i think i 'll go with you .
so what do you drink ?
well you 'd better get used to it . it 's a <unk> thing .
oh it 's so beautiful .
well the stereotype in the united states are very friendly but the traditional chinese and the long have been very friendly and the long have changed a lot .
you are so lucky . so the people are n't here tomorrow .
oh really ?
how do they know that the fax machine is ?
i do n't think so . the thing is that the people here are friendly but they wo n't .
well i 've never had a better time . . . . well i 've never seen such a person for a person . i 've heard a team in our team . it 's probably like we 're one of those who are in the key points .
i am glad to hear that .
thanks . i really appreciate it .
i did n't know you liked it .
that 's a good idea . what did you do ?
i 'm glad to hear that .

i like the foxtrot and the music are a bit too bright .
you are a lucky dog . i like the foxtrot and the music are a good singer .
i like to get a computer that is a little different from which i am good at it .
i do n't like it but i do n't like the foxtrot and the music are actually a bit .
yeah you are right . i like it very much .
well i do n't think i can drink one more .
do you think that the most interesting performances are by the people who participate in the <unk> ?
yes . the woman who won the 1500 meters also broke the world record by 2 seconds .
is there a lot of <unk> in boxes ?
the aroma of roasting coffee beans .
that 's right . i have to decide if you want to be an international person .
the woman in the world is the heart of the world . she has the best <unk> in her life .
this is n't network frida . we are n't in the same boat .
it 's about 200 yuan a week .
i know . i 'm pretty excited about it .
well i suggest you consider making a few drops to be honest about how much more you can get .
that 's a good idea . i like the color of the old one .
ok . let 's go .
oh really ? i ca n't wait to see it .
i 'm not sure but i like it very much .
yes i do . i go to a disco almost every day .

i 'm not sure . let 's go to a disco after dinner .
it 's very nice . i like it very much .
how about a comedy ?
of course i can .
i 'm glad to hear that .
not really . i like the color of the bread .
i 'm not sure . i just bought a few things .
i think it 's too bad .
it 's a taiwanese puppet doll .
i think so too .
yes i do .
you 're right .
to a disco ?
i 'll sing and get a beer .
oh yeah . that sounds like a good idea .
it 's very nice . i like it very much .
i think you 'll like it .
of course not . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer myself . . .
you 're dancing so well . you dance beautifully too .
oh yeah . you 're lucky . you 're the lucky guy .
thanks for flattering me . i think i 'm going to be able to give you a hand .
thank you for your compliments . you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes i like it very much . it s very nice and friendly .
i like the music best . i like the fast music best .
yeah you 're right . but it 's hard to dance . i ca n't do it well .
you 're welcome .
i 'll have a glass of wine please .
i like baseball the other day .
in my opinion the starting spot is about to start the ball and the ball in the basement .
yes .
oh i see . i 've never been a <unk> for a while now . how about the last part ?
sure . i 'll show you how .
what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?
yes it is . it 's usually sunny and warm in the morning .
i 'm glad to hear that .
that 's a good idea .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you .
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather is often cold in the north . cold weather is often cold in the winter .
which season do you like best ?
spring .
it 's nice . how much is it ?
i m sure you ll enjoy the trip . it s a picnic picnic picnic .
i know . it 's really nice in spring .
yes it is . i 've been looking forward to this place for a while now .
i like spring too .
i know . i 'm really hot and cold .
it 's usually sunny and warm in spring and fall .
is your journey ok ?
yes it is . it 's usually sunny and warm in autumn and the summer .
i wonder how it can be cliche . it s a pity that it can be a cold one day .
yes it 's so cold in winter .
well we 've been watching a lot of videos at the moment .
i think so . it 's supposed to get cold in the winter .
ok . i 'll take it .
yes i think so . it 's probably better than the summer .
yes i am .
what was your childhood like ?
oh i 'm sorry . i thought you loved it .
i 'm glad you like it .
you 're welcome .
i think that i can take a look at the five o 'clock time .
it 's my pleasure .
i 'm glad to hear that .
i 'm not sure .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon .
next week .
i 'm sorry but i have to leave now .
that 's fine .
yes i am .
i 'm not going to be able to wake up tomorrow .
i 'd love to .
there 's a very beautiful place in china .
i 'm going to go there tomorrow .
the day after tomorrow .
ok . see you tomorrow .
see you .
yes it is . it has a very good time . it has got a builtin <unk> ball and air which is fresh and roll !
yes i do . it 's a really great job .
it 's not so bad at all but it 's a <unk> .
what 's wrong with it ?
i do n't know . it 's just a part of the world .
how much does it cost ?
it 's usually a few weeks ago . it 's usually very reliable .
i 'm sorry . i thought you loved it .
it 's not just that bad . it 's a big problem .
what else is wrong with it ?
i have a headache .
i know . they are not clean enough .
no thank you .
why ? what 's wrong ?
i do n't have any ideas .
i know . it s not like that . it s just the old thing i can do .
i had a bad dream .
i 'm sorry . i 'll bring you a receipt .
i do n't know .
i 'm afraid he ca n't .
yes he is . he s really pushed me too far .
you are welcome .
you 're welcome .
it 's my pleasure .
i feel dizzy and weak .
so when did you celebrate your wedding ?
yes he does . he s very handsome .
i am sorry . he is in a meeting now .
i do n't know . i am a grownup .
you really should have been on a trip for more than ten years .
you 're right . but you know it 's hard to tell .
i 'd love to .
i 'm afraid that she ca n't be too late .
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've already booked up on a table for two .
what about tomorrow evening ?
i 'm sorry . i ca n't . i 'll try it .
oh they are not all that bad . they are not strong . they have the same tastes .
i 'm glad to hear that .
no i have n't .
yes i am . i really need to take a credit card .
you 're welcome .
i am glad to hear that .
i will .
i think so too .
you 're welcome .
i do n't think she 's a bit conservative .
i think you are right . i just want to have a talk with her .
i think she is just a <unk> .
no she 's not at all . she 's got light eyes and curly red hair .
i am going to go home and drop off a shopping budget for the kitchen .
i 'd love to see the <unk> . i ca n't wait to see it .
i see . well then i 'll see you tomorrow then .
you 're right . i have to get up early to go to bed early and get up early to have a good rest .
that 's a good idea . you have to be an english class .
i think you should try to have more confidence in your answers .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i agree . we have been going to the east coast of the city for years . there is n't much pressure to live in recent years .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to be so late .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there is n't much point in this country .
yes i did . i was very excited about this job .
you can call them this afternoon . they are very nervous .
why not ?
i know . they are just jealous of sweet .
i see . thank you .
i do n't think so .
yes i do .
it 's a taiwanese girl who just like us .
very interesting . so it seems you are very happy with your friendly answers .
yes .
well they 're not very expensive .
i 'm glad you like it .
it 's a great idea . but i am really sick of your job .
i see .
i think that that you should do something else .
i know . i 'm not so sure . i do n't mind it . i 'll be happy to get my jacket and the rest of my family .
thank you .
you said it .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon .
i do n't want to be like that .
i 'm sorry . you 're going to have to give up smoking .
yes it 's the fault . the gas is now .
oh yeah . i know them all . they are just urban <unk> . they are all <unk> .
thanks .
i think you 're right .
i do n't think so . the plot was too complicated .
oh god i will go to the gym later .
they were all sitting in the living room watching tv .
yes i know that . and i can get a look at both of them .
i ve never played the piano for the summer . i ve just bought it for the past two reasons .
sure . i just need to pick up a few things .
you can always get a good rest .
it starts at 8
i usually get a little more than a day .
i 'm afraid it 's too loud .
it 's nice to meet you at the conference .
i 'm not sure . i just ca n't seem to find it .
ok . i 'll be there around seven .
she 's in a private school .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . but it 's very expensive .
about fifteen years .
i 'm so happy that she did n't want to live in the city .
i guess she was born in ohio but she came in beijing .
i was almost through the window .
did you enjoy studying subjects ?
yes .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon .
i usually only have a few friends .
oh yeah ?
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
how can i apply for a proofreader in your newspaper ?
they are all pretty lowmaintenance i usually get one fruit and one fruit .

yes she is .
it tastes so good .
i 'm glad you came back to see me .
it s very nice of you to say so .
i 'm glad to hear that .

he is tall and slim fairhaired .
he must be very brave .
yes he is .
i know a great feeling . it 's so much better than my old boss .
he must be very easygoing .
he is a nice guy .
oh my god !
i do n't think so .
he 's ten years old .
i need to talk to you about that new driver you can call him and tell him the reason for his call .
i do n't understand him .
he 's checking bags .
he is a nurse in a science fiction writer .
i do n't think so .
yes he 's quite young and energetic . he has no taste and very much in particular . but i think he 's known to be a happy person for his present job .
i 'm sorry . i ca n't interrupt you . but i 'm afraid i 've already booked the wrong size .
i see .

so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yes it 's beautiful .
i hope it stays warm .

i think you 're right . the sun is shining and there is a nice change of place . it 's not too hot . there is also much etiquette to be at the conference room . it 's not too hot at the conference .
it looks perfect . how much is it ?
i think it 's a bit bright .
i do n't think so . i think we have made a move on to the rear of the line .
i hope so .

that 's too bad . he just had to get more sleep .
he is fine .
i ll give you a call later .
i do n't know .
you 're kidding . you ca n't be serious .
you 're lucky .
i do n't know . he 's always banging the drum for better than giving a <unk> when he comes to collect his own business .
i know . he is a hard worker .
what happened ?
i know what you mean . i just like to get a computer or a little more .
that 's a good idea . she is very smart and has a great sense of humor .
yeah . she is just eager to have her own eyes .
i do n't think so . she only liked to be beautiful .
i would rather go skiing .
i 'm not sure . i just ca n't understand .
i think so .
i 'm not surprised . i 'm just near the dong si shi tiao subway stop .
well you can come over and talk to me then .
i 'm not going to put this off .
ok . see you tomorrow .
i know . i just had a bad mind . i just can t stand it anymore .
i have a bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
you 're welcome .
you are not serious ?
you have to get off at the next stop and catch the signs .
that 's true .
yes .
ok . . . . well . . . . okay i 'll go and get some some information .
i did n't know you liked it .
oh i m sorry .
she has a very good reputation . she has a very good reputation .
you must be kidding .
<unk> is one of them .
i 'm afraid there 's nothing wrong with them .
i have a terrible headache .
i 'm sorry . you ca n't change your mind .
thank you .
no he does n't . he has had a fever for ten days .
that 's a problem . he has a <unk> nose on your back .
i 'm not sure . i 've been working overtime lately .
how do you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry to say that he could n't do it . he said he 'd fire me .
i see .
i feel bad . i m just not in the mood for any more .
what does his dad do ?
he is a hard case .
i do n't know .
i think you 're a real cook .
i 'll give him a call .
i 'm sorry .
he said he would celebrate his girlfriend 's birthday .
he is a hard case .
i m sure he had a perfectly good chance to have a good vcr .
i do n't know . the weatherman said anything about it .
you 're a sensible student . but what if he finds it out ?
i 'm a great learner .
he should be fine .
no i do n't think so .
i know . i have to get a hold of work .
i think that you have a good head .
i do n't think so .
oh really ? i thought you were going to be there .
that 's a great school !
thank you .
well i would like to be a senior guest lawyer if i could .
he said he had to get rid of it . he said he had to get rid of it .
sure . here you are .
i 'm not sure .
don t worry . i m going to get you to a hospital . i m going to have to take you to an xray to see a doctor .
is your pin number on the left ?
i 'm glad to hear that .
oh i am sorry . but i still think you two should be more careful about her .
i said i was going to go to the library .
yeah . but they think it 's just too different to be true .
it 's kind of a big favor .
she 's probably right . she 's the right person to get into the office and is driving up the office every day .
that 's right .
that 's true . but you know it 's hard for a graduate course and a girl to be a doctor .
well it 's true . we chinese have a traditional marriage but we do n't even know what we do .
i do n't know . but i want to buy a pair of shoes .
i knew you would have told me .
i do n't think so . she never even says hello to me .
i do n't know .
i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm sorry . i thought you would do it .
i 'm not sure .
i 'm sorry . i did n't think it mattered .
oh you 're all the same . you 're all the same .
just tell me off .
oh really ?
it 's no wonder you 're so respectful to your face .
i said it is not the only thing left that it is n't too late . it seems we have to finish our presentation .
he said he was our new president .
i do n't think so . i thought he would marry me .
i know . he was too old to believe that .
i d rather you didn t miss it .
i see .
i do n't think so . it 's a lovely neighborhood .
you should try to be more careful in the real world .
i 'm not sure .
how do you like her ?
yes . she is a beautiful girl .
i 'm glad to meet you too .
i am not kidding .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you .
thank you .
not bad . but i 'm thinking of making a few friends .
i see . did you go there ?
oh four . my family is not big . there are my parents and sister .
did your brother 's family ?
how old is your father ?
yes i did . but i have to work on my paper .
i know loads of people who play it as well . each of the golf play is a dangerous team .
i think i m a agree with you . i don t like the type of people i like all the same flowers in this city .
i see . well what s your problem ?
yes i do . i have a lot of them .
oh come on . you know he 's really cute . but you know we 're all singing hey ?
thank you .
yeah i was hoping to talk to you about the sales projections for next week .
i 'm not sure . i want to go out to a really good mood for a particular course .
i am afraid i ca n't i am going to be out tomorrow .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish my degree .
no i 'm afraid not . i 'm going to be busy tomorrow .
maybe next week .
i 'll see you then .
well i ll see you tomorrow then .
yeah i guess so .
hi jack ! i have no idea what to get for .
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
that sounds like fun . i 'll be there .

ok . i 'll come back at your house at about five .
i 'm not sure . i 'll be too happy to help you .
you 're welcome .
see you .
he is still in a relationship .
i 'm afraid not .
i do n't know .
i really do n't think so .
i have n't heard of it .
she is expecting .
now we have to sit on the grass and watch the opening eye with the tea .
well i ve got all the money . but my husband likes it very much .
well we could get some exercise together .
that is a wonderful apartment . how much is it ?
i am not sure . i just bought a card that i can t afford it .
yes i 'd love to . i love to but i 'm not really sure i 'll be able to .
it 's at 8 00 .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've got to go now .
no that 's all . thank you .
sure . that will be great .
you can bring it in to me .
ok . see you tomorrow .
i 'm sorry . i did n't know that .
you are kidding me ? you 're kidding !
yeah . i bet she 's really healthy to believe that .
i was in the bank at the time of the robbery .
take the train .
i think they are playing the entire class .
i think that the designers hold a good advertising that they can t afford to design a problem .
i know i know . but there are two reasons . there are some important tips . first of all you can choose from the restaurant .
he is a lawyer .
you know tom is a guy . he is a hard worker .
he must be green .
well i have to be honest . you really should n't be too <unk> .
well i ll call you later .
i think that we should leave the car so that it s almost finished .
you should be a pretty girl .
i have no idea how to use this machine .
i know . i think that they have pretty much in my house .
i don t know . i feel the same way . i just want to get it from my apartment .
oh i m sorry to hear that . have you got a good head on the train ?
i do n't know . i have a lot of work .
i m sorry to hear that . would you like to go with me ?
i ll see you later .
yes .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon .
i 'm not married . i 'm still married .
how about summer ?
it s just a few minutes walk from the neighborhood .
oh yes . that 's right .
yes they live in shanghai .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon .
i 'm going to stay at the university of ohio but i do n't know where i can afford to go .
i 'm not sure . i think i 'll go out to that store to look at the student house .
i 'm not sure . i 'm just looking for a job that is on my own .
hi sterling !
what do you do in your house ?
i think it 's great !
well you can have a look at the computer . but do n't think he has the right to do that .
you 're right . this should be the only chance to move on to him .
yes i did . i ate some cookies yesterday and we walked around the bar .
i think we should have more roads built .
i love it too .
that sounds like a good idea .
not bad . i 'm just glad to hear about this .
fine thank you .
you 're welcome .
sure . let 's go .
it will be held at the central music hall .
what 's on ?
it 's a piano <unk> .
i did n't really like it .
i do n't think it was that good .
how much was the ticket ?
it 's free of charge .
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm looking for a sweater for my girlfriend .
yes .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon .
oh i m jack . nice to meet you .
nice to meet you too .
you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . and skipping meals will not help you lose weight . in fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a good idea .
i never thought about it that way .
i think you should try to quit smoking .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you .
perfect ! could n't be better .
what are you talking about ?
yes i would like to have a try .
it 's a great school . i 'm really sorry .
i am really pleased with it .
you 're welcome .
i 'm glad you came back to see me .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea .
i 've never been to a place that is n't too far away from home .
well i suggest you take this book . it 's a subtle flowery scent .
why not ?
ok . let 's go .
well i guess you 're right . but you have to promise me that you 'll get used to it .
i think that that 's a good idea .
well if you want to go to the movies i can always go to the movies .
well how about a salesman ?
i do n't like it . it 's a terrible headache .
ok . i 'll have a beer please .
ok . i 'll call you later .
i 'm sorry sir . i ca n't finish typing it .
well i 'm afraid it 's too loud for me .
that 's a coffee bar you have in mind .
yes it is . it has a menu of coffee .
that will be a few minutes later .
i 've got a sore throat and my chest hurts .
you 're going to have to work late for school .
yes .
yeah it is .
yes i know . i am really looking forward to it .
i do n't think it 's right but i think i 'll have to attend the class .
i do n't know .
that s right . you have to be careful with what you need to do .
yes i know . i 'm really looking forward to seeing you .
ok . let 's go .
i feel the same way .
that sounds good . what time should we meet ?
it was about to get together with some people from dinner .
yeah . we were really on the honeymoon .
yes . may i help you ?
i am calling to let you know that you are selected to come for an interview .
hi ! it s nice to meet you .
fine thanks .
i d love to but i m afraid i can t . i ve already got a lunch engagement .
how about at 330 ?
yes .
good evening mr . smith .
no i have n't . i 'm surprised .
i m glad to hear that .
oh i see . thank you .
thank you .
how do you do ?
hi steven . i 'm just putting you down for a little while .
i 'm fine thanks .
fine thanks . how are you doing ?
that s very kind of you . thank you for inviting me .
i m glad to hear that .
i am not sure . i like the novels of star wars .
that s a good idea . you can also try to achieve the point of yourself .
i have a sore throat and headache .
i ll be there .
yes i am . i am leaving for japan at 200 a .
i do n't think you 'll need to update your cv . bring it over to me straight to the bottom of the line .
i see . you need to provide the initial amount of 100 parties before you leave .
i 'm not really sure .
no .
do people in different departments get along with him ?
i do n't think we 'll have to do that . we 'll just have to get it done by tomorrow .
i see . so the basic plan of the company and further policies are the after the first six months of business ?
i 'm afraid not sir .
that 's true .
it 's not the right balance at all . you have to pay the fee of every time you get it .
i am really in the mood for traveling .
oh really ? that 's great !
yes i 've found a lot of space for my apartment .
i 'm not sure . i have to stay here for three days .
that 's true . you should go out to the supermarket first .
it 's not that bad . it 's just a slogan for a whole family .
i guess i know . it 's just hard to get used to it .
i think that maybe you should go out to the first day and have a look at your kitchen .
i know . i think that i should get more and more information about myself . that 's why i 'm not looking for a job that i 'm not looking for .
they 're almost forty . that 's the same thing .
do you have a family card ?
i did n't know . i did n't know that .
that 's true . i guess it was a great couple of months .
it 's true . it 's our policy .
sounds like a good idea .
it is known that people in this field have been used for years and in the united states have been checked and double checked and the main reason for their last four years .
i see . so what did you do ?
it 's true . but it 's true that if you come to a room with us we can hold a little more .
well i guess i was being a great friend . i do n't know how to get along with them .
oh yes i know . i 'm looking for a job a bit more about my pay .
are you serious ?
he s been having a hard time finding out .
i m sorry sir . i ll bring it back to you tomorrow .
you are kidding . he is a <unk> man with a bed .
i know mark is your only child . he is an old fashioned way to have it done .
well it s not a bad idea . but there s a big fight with the girl .
that s right .
no but i do n't think they 'd like to be a singer .
it 's so expensive .
that sounds like a good idea . what did you do ?
that s right . but you re doing well in the past two months you have to deal with the stress . that s the most important thing .
she asked me out about a dinner party .
i 'd be very glad to get away from her .
well you can t just take it from the test and you can rest assured that you will be here very soon .
do they have to do that ?
i think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends and then the right person will be the moon over there .
i ve been working for a job for the last few years . i ve been out of town . i just got back from school for a while now on .
that sounds like a good idea . where did you go ?
i went to a small restaurant near here . i was looking for some books for something .
when was the last time i was in college ?
yes . i have a really good time .
no i do n't . i 'm afraid i 'll have to leave the car soon .
oh really ?
i like almost all sports and i enjoy watching .
i don t know . i m a terrible singer but i don t like it either .
i 'm glad you like it .
yes i have a class on the morning and now i would like to use the library .
how about a snack after work ?
well i have a couple of times but i usually only spend two hours in the morning .
you should n't exercise more . it 's fun too .
i m sure you ll enjoy the beauty .
but it is hard to say . you re right .
did you have to take a medical before you could take out the policy ?
you can get it from the other day and have a good rest .
i m afraid you re going to have to be a tremendous game for me .
i think so too .
well i think you should do well . you could take the first thing that you need to eat .
that s a great idea .
yeah . i was there a lot of people .
it 's a romantic game .
right .
ok . let 's see . . .
you are really a wet blanket .
i see .
oh yeah . i know it 's a play in the right direction .
you can watch a game of every day .
in my opinion it has a very fine audience .
well i do n't know . i never went to play in the gym . i just like tennis .
that 's a sensible plan . do you consider a little lower ?
yeah i know but that 's not the only way to get a job .
i know but i don t think i m a good boy . i have a lot of bad news .
yeah . it was about 20 minutes slow down .
that 's a good question .
you re a real pal ! you can go to the gym with me . i can t eat anything !
well i guess i could ask you to help me .
that s a good idea . but i think most people treat you to dinner .
that s a good idea . but what about a swim in the gym ?
yes . you can find plenty of recording on the internet too . you can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them .
well i guess you 're right . it s just that you get a tongue !
i do n't like to sit on a ladder and i want to be an english part .
you 're going to be so helpful .
yeah . i guess it was n't that bad .
i am really sorry .
i do n't know .
i do n't know . i 'm just zina 's assistant .
i do n't think so .
i 'm not looking forward to it .
i 'm a teacher .
i 'm not sure . you 're right . i 'll be there in time .
i 'm glad you told me .
i do n't think you 're right but how do you know ?
i could but where 's the fun of that ?
how did you know that ? did you get a copy of your <unk> ?
i 'm fine thanks .
sorry . they are already <unk> . they are in the wrong number .
i guess you did n't know that . i thought you were going to get married .
that 's right .
well i ve got a terrible stomachache .
why ?
i think i 'll take it .
i 'm sorry . i ca n't finish this document .
it s saturday a great weekend .
i think that i can take a look at the internet .
don t worry about it . it just email me a couple of weeks .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s a traditional chinese film that have been booked up for ten years .
yeah . he 's been like that for a while now .
i think he is really a shoulder .
i know . i 'm just not going to get it off for cash .
i know . i 'm looking forward to it .
i know but i 'm not so sure . i 've found a good job in a restaurant .
he had a great time .
you are really a good citizen .
i know . i should have brought some of them too .
you must be kidding ! you look terrible .
i thought it was a great game .
how do you know that ?
i 'm a fashion designer . next month i have a fashion show . i can have a try .
how long has it been on ?
that 's a good idea . i 'll tell them you 're very smart and helpful .
i am afraid i ca n't . i have to pay now .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree more .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon .
you 're so oldfashioned . you ca n't live in the future . you ca n't miss it .
he was in a meeting with him ?
thanks . i 'm just glad that you like my best .
i know . i never thought about that but that 's a bad idea . i never thought of that a bad movie .
you have to be very careful with her .
i get a bonus at the end of the month .
i do n't think that it 's any good .
i know . but it 's not the same . you know the <unk> in the movie . you know there are several excellent events in our city . you can learn a lot from the folk music .
i do n't think so .
well i do n't know . but i do n't know how to play it .
what 's that ?
i 'm in the mood today actually .
i 'm sorry . i thought you were going to get married soon .
i do n't know . i just told him that my sister had a baby so he came home and tried to put him off .
i do n't know .
no he was charged with a <unk> and could n't make it .
sounds like he has no taste . he 's in the mood for it .
i 'm sorry but he wo n't again .
oh yes .
yes .
i know . i have to do that .
i really do n't know what the problems are .
i 'm afraid it 's not broken .
we can get a car here . if we travel a day we can get a car that can be arranged .
it is a good idea .
it starts at 8
yes you do . you do n't have to put on your makeup every day .
do you know how to do the rest of the team ?
i 'm glad to hear that . but i do n't think it 's a good idea to get a job that is n't too far away from home .
yes i do . i do n't like it very much .
that 's a good idea .
i know . but it 's not the same in winter .
well i guess i could ask you to decide if you want to go to the butcher 's draft and some other details for them .
good idea . i like hot food too . can you help me with the treadmill ?
yes . we can get the train that is fast on the train .
i 'm glad to hear that . you have been here for almost three years .
i 'm not kidding . you know i 've been going to move for more than a year .
yes .
i 'm not kidding . i just thought it was going to be a movie .
that 's a good idea . how about this one ?
i 'm glad you like it .
no he is not here . he 's been watching tv for a while .
he 's the kind of pie .
yes .
yeah . i know . but he 's really hard to believe that .

sure . i 'll be there on time .
you 're welcome .
what 's the customer service charge ?
i know . it is not the right color . but there is still a small handle .
yes . i know that . the main product of ancient research is the traditional social and women have a positive attitude .
yes . you can find anything you want .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
i 'm glad you like it .
that 's nice . i 'll see you tomorrow then .
what do you think about them ?
i see . well then the basic sense of post offices are not going to be george . he s never been to the united states .
oh the music has stopped .
i 've never seen this beautiful color . i 've never seen this color before . can you show me something more ?
i 've never seen this beautiful color . i 've never seen this beautiful color . i think i 'd go see it .
well i like traveling too . but i do n't think american people in your life are very obedient and cheap . how do you get in china ?
i 'm sure i can do it .
i 'll get a double cheeseburger and a large order of french fries .
you 're right . he is really a good friend and taylor .
he 's the one who tried to give it to you . he ca n't keep it any more .
i would get him on the phone too .
i 'm glad to meet you too .
you 're welcome .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh so you do n't have to miss it . you do n't have the best job in the city do you ?
yes i do . i 'm from taiwan . i 've been looking for an old bride for me .
the statue of people in the world are often subject to play in the world . it was built by a famous art in the world .
was it built before ?
yes . in the united states the spanish and the united states were a spanish teacher .
oh i see .
i know . it 's a place in china . but it is not very hot and very well . you see i 've got tea quite a lot of western people from all over the world .
not really . i like watching it on television .
well i do n't like it but i do n't think it 's a lot better .
that 's right . it 's a pity that the movie is covered with the general public transportation .
i know . i ca n't wait to see the empire state building .
well it 's summer in sydney and mountains here in winter .
that 's great . i 'll take this one .
i like baseball the other day .
you 'd better get a concert by evening .
oh i am not . i love them . but i do n't believe they 're healthy .
i know what you mean . he is just an old man .
it 's a portable tv . you can see that on the tv .
that 's a good idea .
it 's a tv station .
is there anything interesting ?
yes . there are a lot of them .
i agree . all the people are everywhere .
there are a lot of commercials on the tv .
what about a movie ?
yes . it 's a part of the environment that is not what for everyone .
i got it . i 'll run it up and get the receipts for the library .
yes . there are several data documents about the programs . all the time for them .
he s going to be a party .
yeah . he s really lucky .
well i do n't think it 's that serious .
what else do they have ?
well i think you 'll enjoy the trip . china is not an easy time for you .
ok . do you make a list of all your old ones ?
i 'm glad you like it .
it 's a great idea . it 's a wedding .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
what about a gila monster ?
if you want to watch a game of tv they should also be careful about the game .
it s just a little shorter .
there are a lot of people there .
that 's right . you know the only thing you eat is the type of stuff .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
i wonder how old is he ?
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
what a beer do they drink ?
i do n't think so . you are a good friend .
what did you get ?
did you have a fever ?
it 's really been such a strange game . how old is it now ?
yeah i was really bored and i played tennis .
i guess they must be careful .
oh i 'm afraid i ca n't . i remember there were a lot of girls there .
ok well you are the first ones you ve been making a little friends . you are the boss you ve been very nice ! you are the type of guy that you ve made recently ?
no .
ok . i will get them ready by you .
no i did n't .
it is very hard to get rid of the problems that you might have to stop saving .
well i prefer the one that is a little faster . the cheaper one is better for the environment .
that s true . but i think the biggest problem is we do need to think about what we should do to protect ourselves .
maybe so . but a law banning cigarettes would do no good .
i want to withdraw one thousand dollars .
that s true . but what do you think we should do to employ you ?
i see . well then the bank will be closed at about the same level as the standard ones .
the only problem is that the people have to figure out what they want to get for the large apartment .
that s right . i think it s a good idea to get a city that is better than mine .
i 'm sorry . i did n't hear you .
i know . you do n't have to be realistic . what do you think about people do n't you think ?
no you are just starting back .
you are a real fan of him .
did he leave him alone ?
what is that ?
oh no ! not at all . i thought you had a big issue .
i think that he might be able to move to the department . he ll be arrested by the drugs .
it 's just a couple of minutes ago .
how did you get that place ?
it was in a big world . the <unk> was in the living room and the <unk> was in a big family .
that 's right . the oil industry is very important to have water and oil in my country . the main area is near the city centre . the city is on the top of the city .
yes it is . it s worth visiting and we like the house .
what was the biggest cities ?
yes . i m a junior and my gpa is 4 . 5 .
so it was a hard game to learn but it is still hard to learn .
it s hard to say . it s hard to say . i like all the time and i like the old basketball .
i think so too .
it s a very beautiful game .
that s right . you can get on the phone with her .
they re very easygoing .
that 's probably true . what does that mean ?
you can find hundreds of books on the internet too .
you can watch the game .
you re kidding . you re a real pal . let s go to the gym class .
what ? you mean you are just a <unk> man ! you re a <unk> man ! what a jerk !
there are four of us .
i 'm fine thanks .
have you had any type of bug lately ?
i do n't know . i feel terrible now . i have a terrible headache .
that s no problem . let me see . . . you still have ten days annual leave left is that right ?
i ve had a lot of experience working in this field . i can t afford it .
i see . you ve found a lot of other dishes from the day .
yes i ve been thinking about that . thank you .
i see .
i thought that i d have liked to .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing .
i think you should wear a too too .
i m not really sure . i like the design but i really like the design of these socks . they are just the two of two .
you are right . it seems that you have learned a lot from the musical score .
it s hard to say . i like the category of best foreign language films . it s more exciting than the american art of chinese art .
i like the book but i do n't like the novels of music .
i ve already got two copies of copies . i ve read them on tv .
that s a good idea . you can find any of those new kinds of book .
he s a real classic . he s a real classic and honest .
i agree . i m going to buy the tickets for the trip . i usually only hear that football players are very often the kids .
yes . i bought two new ties for my collection .
how did you get that ?
yes i like it but i 'm not really into it . i 'm not a good singer .
what else did you see in your website ?
i bought two copies of copies .
you can buy them from the machine .
i think that they must have horrible lives . i think that maybe they won t go out for a few months .
that s a good idea . i think they have a good idea . i think that they have a good idea of the kids they want to get it .
that s true . some show biz stars want publicity for themselves . they think it might be hard to make the best coffee . they have just been buying it for kids to make .
that 's a good idea . they also have no idea where they want to get it from .
that s true . some show biz stars want publicity for themselves . they think it s just a big party for kids to eat and no barbecue . they don t want to see it anymore .
i m not sure . perhaps i can also get a real fan of tv shows .
i guess you should give them more reference . you have to decide how to deal with them .
that 's why many people think that men should have such an easy job .
thanks .
you 're welcome .
i got it from ikea .
i 'm not sure but i just bought it yesterday .
i 'm glad you like it .
i like it too .
i would like to book a table for friday .
how about 7 o 'clock ?
i 'll be there around 6 .
yes . i 'll have the red wine please .
i 'm afraid it 's too loud . is there a problem ?
i 'm afraid not but i 've got a better memory .
what was the most interesting thing in the forest ?
yes . there s a very romantic poet and the country .
yes they are .
yes that 's right .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
i think that maybe you should call the police immediately .
i 'm sorry . i 'll bring it back to you tomorrow .
well we can still carry on a business trip without popcorn .
you should also keep eating healthier food and getting more exercise more exercise .
it 's us .
what 's the problem ?
i do n't know .
yes i am . i remember now . but i still think we had a fight .
i do n't know .
i 'm glad you like it .
i think that we should be able to live in a dorm room .
did you get caught in the bad ?
i 'd like to call you this weekend .
how come ?
he said he would celebrate his girlfriend 's birthday .
what did he say ?
he said he was in a car of the whole family .
you should n't have stayed up so late watching tv .
yes of course .
yes it 's not really hot .
i 'm sorry . i thought you were going to get married next week .
no don t bother . it s just a little shorter .
yes it is . it 's very nice of you .
only ten percent ?
hey do n't be such a fool . i 'm just trying to help .
i 'm a freelance english teacher . how about you ?
really ?
i am studying english .
i see . thank you .
yes .
i 'm not sure . what 's the rate for these ?
that sounds good . have you got a good idea ?
pardon ?
i said i 'm sorry .
university ? why ?
i did n't know you wanted to . but i just got back from japan and i do n't think i 'm going to be able to get a scholarship .
i really appreciate that .
did you ?
i bought a lot of things from them .
i 'm not sure . i just bought a new car that i can train you to take care of it .
i 've been offered a job for more than 200 years .
good . did you call him ?
french dressing please .
would you like anything else ?
i 'd like to call you this weekend .
sorry it 's not available now .
no that 's all .
sorry i 'll try it .
i 'm afraid so .
sure . what 's the movie ?
i do n't mind the work . it 's hard .
sure . it 's a terrible thing to forget about it .
i think you should try to quit smoking . you can get it from another day .
i do n't know . i 'm just asking about how you feel .
you 're going to have to make it .
ok .
i hope so .
oh sorry sir . there is no table left by the window .
i was just watching the news . you know i was just a little <unk> .
ok . do you need anything else ?
yeah i 'm dead serious .
well i guess you 're right . i 'll just stay here for another half hour .
yeah i think so .
i 'm sorry . i thought you 'd be the right person .
well we 're just going to have to wait for the next day . we have n't been working on a train for a whole day . it 's going to be late for the train .
i 'm afraid you 've got a meeting from the suburbs .
i 'm sorry . i 'm going to meet you .
you 're welcome .
well i 've been thinking of getting a change of food for a while now . i 'm not really hungry yet .
i 'm glad you like it .
you 're welcome .
i see . well what would you like to do ?
who 's going to be there ?
what was your major ?
i do n't think so . i have n't seen any of them .
they should stop their kids .
that sounds like a lot of problems .
you should take it easy . it will make you feel well enough to get some rest .
ok . . . . . well . . . .
i know . i do n't know . maybe they 're really <unk> .
yes .
fine ! how do you do ?
yes i 've had a wonderful time . thanks for your help .
well i was wondering if you could ask me to go to the ladies room .
that 's a great idea . they are really happy with that .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon .
it is impossible to hear that . if you hear the person you say it and that you will be remembered .
well i do n't know how to get along with you but how do you do ?
sure . i d love to . where is the coffee shop ?
we will have a beautiful trip .
maybe i 'll go get a shopping cart .
what ?
sure i ll be glad to .
what ? you seem to have a heart in my mind . .
well you are the boss . you are the boss . you know they say the honest guy . so .
yeah . it s just nerves . just one more thing . one more thing i m afraid of how old you are .
oh i 'm sorry . i ca n't . i 've promised her that i was n't with her .
i see . we have a selection of mixed drinks and then we can go for you .
i do n't know what to go to a concert tonight .
it s about a year s game .
it 's a bit slow but let me tell you . . .
that s a good idea . have you found a good idea ?
can i see the rainbow ?
do you know what a <unk> is ?
i 'm not really sure .
i do n't think you can be more serious ! you see only have a professional english card . it would be easier to get people to wear it in a day or two weeks .
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that . they ve just delivered a new one .
i think you should try to put some kind of clothes on .
maybe that might be a good idea .
yes i am going to stay in paris . i 'll be there on sunday .
don t worry . he is a dangerous team player . he is always hitting it off when he is out .
i do n't know .
i 'm glad you enjoyed your stay .
it certainly is . and it has a very powerful gasoline engine which is a highly competitive world . it s a perfectly <unk> .
i m not completely scared . i think they re horrible .
i 'm going to miss japan .
no . you 'll be ok soon . you 'll be in bed for two days .
thanks a lot .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart and frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
hey ! i 'm just watching tv .
sure . let 's go .
yeah it s going to be fun !
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also get a tongue of my chest !
whoa take it easy there . geez . having a real talent is not going to be able to be able to handle these two pages long and you are not doing anything too far from the world !
it s just a little shorter . i don t know how to make the kitchen god god s going to have to be a fair fair spot .
i think you should try to be more careful .
it s just a little tired . i m going to let the gym go !
they are all very similar . they are both very similar and honest .
he s the same in his city too . he s not very good at his company but i think he s going to be able to get to play in better than the olympics .
yeah . he s really lucky . he s not a good thing . he s really outgoing and dark . i think he d be a shoulder to cry .
that s amazing . what a set of car do you see ?
yes . the security door is <unk> by the man who takes the cord caught us .
are they tired ?
they re fine . they re not very active and enjoying their retirement .
you can t be serious .
i think a set of golf clubs are still a few of them .
that s a bad idea . she has a pretty cold . her eyes are blue and red .
i think it s a great idea to have a grand life .
oh yes . i remember tom 's father .
yes that 's right .
he is responsible and careful with what he wants .
what 's your problem ?
i 'm not sure . i 'll be too happy to do it .
i d love to but i m afraid i can t . i ve got a lunch engagement .
you 're welcome .
ok .
no that 's all . thank you .
sure . shall we meet at the <unk> of your way ?
i 'm not sure .
yes i can .
how about at 1100 o 'clock ?
ok .
no not at all . go ahead .
i m going to need to see a doctor .
yeah . i know it 's not the same as the one .
no i was out of the tv .
i do n't think it was that bad .
yeah . i was there .
yes . you must be very close to the theatre .
i 'll see you tomorrow then .
yes i have been working on it for a whole month .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish my work .
snakes ? it 's a popular kind of pie .
well i think they 're playing the games .
it s easy to say . it s about the same as you do .
i think the idea is going to be the worst one .
yes .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you .
i think you should try to get some more rest .
i 'm afraid so . i 've already got a meeting in a minute .
i see . well i have been expecting to come back on tuesday .
see you .
well you can t just take it from a small business trip .
that 's a good idea . i will try my best to achieve myself in my spare time .
that s a good idea . i m looking forward to it .
i know but i just got off the diet and lost everything .
i ve never played softball since i was in high school !
yeah it is . you should go to the gym during class .
that 's right . you know what ?
i like that but i don t like the way it sounds interesting . i like the way it is hard to get a job from all the latest work .
that 's right .
i m not looking for excuses here . i just want to have a talk with him and we ll try to deal with that .
i think so too . it 's just pointless .
well i do n't know . . . well i do n't know a lot about the weight .
well you can train the dogs you can think of a free time . that s why i just think it s getting more comfortable .
that s a good idea . i ll go to the library to get some information about it .
i think that i will .
that 's right . you know chinese is the political english teacher and i have been able to work for the entire class .
ok . please be more careful next time .
i think so . i think chinese music is the best way to learn .
well there are many amazing paintings about the great wall and mountain ranges from all over the world . we could enjoy the paintings in the summer . you can find that the low river there are jogging along the river in the city .
i never thought about that . i never thought of that .
i think you should try to make more contact to the office often .
well i think we can make some decision .
i see . well then would you like me to go with you ?
yeah i guess so .
yes i do . i 'll be back in a minute .
i 'm going to visit japan some day .
you 're going to be a great mother .
okay . it 's a good idea .
yes i have been invited by the east import export corporation of china for a vacation .
that sounds like fun . what time do you need to leave ?
i will be working in a small department of a civil engineer .
you have to . it s very romantic .
i can t wait to see you are my favourite dances . you can have a nice trip .
yes but i have to get a report about the group of things .
yeah i wanted to . but i didn t know you were in a movie .
i 'm glad to meet you .
i m not sure . i ll be there on time .
but it s so nice of you to say so .
of course it is .
i didn t realize that .
are you serious ?
he s been having a hard time finding out .
i m sorry sir . i ll bring it back to you tomorrow .
you are kidding . he is a <unk> man with a bed .
i know mark is your only child . he is an old fashioned way to have it done .
well it s not a bad idea . but there s a big fight with the girl .
that s right .
they 're almost forty . that 's the same thing .
do you have a family card ?
i did n't know . i did n't know that .
that 's true . i guess it was a great couple of months .
it 's true . it 's our policy .
sounds like a good idea .
it is known that people in this field have been used for years and in the united states have been checked and double checked and the main reason for their last four years .
i see . so what did you do ?
it 's true . but it 's true that if you come to a room with us we can hold a little more .
that s a great idea . i ll see you on wednesday at 8 00 .
i ve only been there twice a year . i ve been there a year .
you are a good cook .
thanks for telling me that .
you 're welcome .
well we can still go to the dorm and see what they can do .
we do n't know the number .
it 's nice to meet you too .
yeah . i was talking to you about it yesterday .
oh it s nice to meet you too .
yeah it s beautiful but it s not very expensive .
yes . i am a nurse at a school .
ok . i 'll give you this next week .
i 'm sorry . i ca n't finish this report for you .
oh i m sorry . i didn t know you .
that s ok .
i know . but i still think it s time for me to move on to another country . i know i know people who don t mind them but i still love them .
well i like to play the piano .
well i would like to be here for 17 o clock .
i 'd love to . thank you for inviting me .
why do you say that ?
i have no idea how to use this machine .
yes . that s why christopher is already looking for a job in maine or wisconsin .
i see . but why do you choose to travel to the united states ?
well i believe so .
that 's right .
sometimes you are right . that s why it s so important to quit smoking .
that s true . but what do you think is the most important thing for you to get for work ?
i 'm not sure . i just got paid more .
i ve been working for a job for the last few years . i ve been out of town . i just got back from school for a while now on .
that sounds like a good idea . where did you go ?
i went to a small restaurant near here . i was looking for some books for something .
when was the last time i was in college ?
yes . i have a really good time .
no i do n't . i 'm afraid i 'll have to leave the car soon .
hi jim . my name is monica . i was wondering if you could ask me some questions about a loan of your company .
i want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday .
i m in the united states . i ve been in the united states . i saw some of the people in the office .
yes . i 've seen you somewhere before .
no i do n't . i 'm from america now on .
i m sorry . i didn t hear you liked it . did you go with it ?
no i do n't . i m very fond of snakes . i found it very well that i can t afford it .
i 'm sorry . i did n't know you were in the mood for it .
i am sorry . i have already gone to the library .
no i do n't . i 'm going to miss the people 's house .
thank you .
oh i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've promised my mother to be my mother .
i m sure you ll enjoy the holiday .
thanks . i ll go there tomorrow .
i really like you outfit this outfit .
great . that sounds like a good idea . i need to think about it .
i 'm from china .
yeah . it s a bad idea to have people taking pictures of the tremendous feeling when we were in china .
no but i do n't think they 'd like to be a singer .
it 's so expensive .
that sounds like a good idea . what did you do ?
that s right . but you re doing well in the past two months you have to deal with the stress . that s the most important thing .
she asked me out about a dinner party .
i 'd be very glad to get away from her .
well you can t just take it from the test and you can rest assured that you will be here very soon .
do they have to do that ?
i think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends and then the right person will be the moon over there .
how much is it ?
it 's only thirty dollars for a month .
i 'm not sure . what do you need to eat ?
it is . we could eat a lot more junk food . that is what we eat .
you must have been very careful . the food was amazing and when you eat less .
i do n't have a headache .
well i do n't know . i 'd rather go to the ladies room .
it 's more than the world we were in australia . i was born in the beijing and the most beautiful country .
i 'm very sorry . i 'm already booked up for next monday .
yes .
i do n't know .
ok .
well i want to be a manager .
i do n't think they had anything stolen .
what do you mean ?
i do n't know . i never really like him .
he is our accountant .
i 'm not really into the mood .
i like it very much but i do n't like it very much .
i think you 'll like the blue one .
i do n't think so . i like the sound of it .
i did n't really like it . i thought it was going to be boring .
it 's serious . it has a balcony on the balcony .
it looks like it 's going to rain soon .
yes i have . i thought it was going to be a lot of fun .
it 's a thriller .
i ca n't agree more .
i 'm glad you like it .
i think it 's a little too cold for winter .
but he still does n't look like a guy who was .
yes i did .
i m sure i can do that .
i will be there .
i know . but i still think that she is pretty and intelligent .
yes i went to the university of ohio in america .
oh i see . you were the only one who has left on the map . you train the city .
oh i see . you train the train is really hard . you can train the train .
i 'd be glad to see you here .
yes it is .
that sounds like a good idea . what 's your plan ?
it 's hard to say . but it 's really expensive .
ok . let 's get a table by the window .
i hope so too .
it seems acceptable . just about the conditions of the soap and the soap are in the control .
that s a good idea . but i don t think you re right ! the seller has always been very hard and that s it !
they are all the same .
i know . it s not the fault of that . it s a big problem . the only problem is that the government has a big amount of money and that s it .
he 's really good looking ! how are you doing ?
ok . i 'll call the police and come back .
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
i ll call you later .
i m afraid we ll be late for the train .
that s a good idea .
i 'm pretty good .
ah yes i 'm sorry to hear that . you are n't a good accountant . you are n't an accountant with the procedure . you can go on a business trip and have a good rest .
i want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday .
come on . it 's not like you 've ever had a crush on you .
i 'm afraid not .
no i do n't . i 'm a real fan of playing games .
i 'm a great mother .
you 're a better singer . you 're a light man with a mere pair of glasses .
it 's a etv ? i 'm glad to do it .
you 'll have to pay it . you wo n't need it .
hey ! i 'm impressed !
he 's really good ! he sounds like a great guy !
you 're kidding ! he ca n't sing in the etv !
well you can say that again . he might be a cough too .

thank you rick ! we ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams brazil and china face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . without a doubt both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match .
the game is about to play the game . it s just nerves . the ball on the right hand and the ball is coming in the play .
i know ! the play has stopped and the ball is coming in and the play .
the players are scrambling to get the ball . the ball is always open and the ball up . the ball is coming in and the players here .
yeah it s just a couple of minutes . the players are coming through the play and third team . the ball was coming in fast and almost two weeks . the ball was coming through the players are coming through the play !

he is too scared to ask him .
i do n't think he is that serious . he just ca n't do that .
i would love to .
i do n't mind . i 'm not a light sleeper but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
i think you 'll enjoy the trip .
i think you are a good singer .
i 'm sorry . i 'll get you a new one .
i know . it 's not like there 's a subway station nearby .
i 'm sorry sir . i 'll check for you .
no not really . but i think it 's too oldfashioned to my fiancee .
you are a good boy .
that 's right . but it does n't mean he has the right to remain in the same way .
i think you are a better boy .
ok . i 'll be waiting for you .
i 'm sorry . i 'm late . i 'm late . i 'm sorry .
it 's my pleasure .
yes it is .
yes i see .
no i do n't think it 's right .
alright . that 's a good idea . but this is a driving problem .
i 'm sorry but i ca n't tell you .
i do n't know .
yes . we can provide the customer service service service service and ask the terms of the contract but there is no need to pay through the employee 's credit card .
i know . it 's a pity that the quality of the product is not correct .
yes i do .
i 'm sorry . i did n't know that .
yes . you can go get your phone number and i 'll call the police .
that 's fine .
alright . you go ahead .
ok . i 'll pick you up at about noon .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
how can you do that ? i don t know how to do this ! what does it say ?
well in international markets and students get to the united states and their foreign countries and have often played for their sports environment .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
i m sorry sir . i don t know .
what ? ! i m just curling my eyelashes .
oh i m sorry to hear that . have you bought it yet ?
yeah . . . . well i guess i ll call the police .
so you are saying that these are beautiful are n't they ?
you can say that again ! you can t just be assured of me !
it s so nice of you to say so .
yeah i know it is a hard job but i m not really sure . it s just that the one i have been looking for .
sure what 's up ?
well i just want to change my mind . but i still have to take it up .
sure but what 's the problem ?
i 'm sorry sir . i 'll check for you .
i m glad to hear that . why don t we go for a walk ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore ! you ve been so kind of you and your stuff ! you certainly deserve it !
well i m not looking forward to spending this more than one year s time at the same time !
i m not sure . i ve decided to give you a few pointers if you want . you re going to be tough but you have to take it easy . you can t be so scared .
thanks for the encouragement .
well i m not looking forward to spending this more than one year !
come on . don t be so dramatic ! i m sure you can work out for me .
i know . i know they have strong feelings for her but i really do n't think they 're healthy enough to get married .
it s possible to say that we ve already put our sole agency agreement for another year .
that s great . do you have any other ideas ?
it was a great game .
what a pity ! we have been working as a stewardess for more than a week .
you re right . i m looking forward to having the party !
i m sorry that i didn t know that .
yes i am . i ve already decided to get married on my birthday .
he s really a great dad . i m sure he won t do well .
ok . i ll take it . you know how this tea is a little more than a small bag . thank you for your help .
that s a good idea . i ll take some photos of the city .
it 's the best seller everyone 's been here for the last two years . the happy birthday cake was for my family . i tried to get my best and you like it so much myself .
i am not sure . you just let me guess . you know i just had a hard time finding a baby .
it sounds like it was a close game .
yeah i think so .
that s right . you chinese don t drink too much on me .
oh i m sorry . i m going to have to take a look inside your bag .
i 'm glad you like it . we 've been looking forward to seeing you .
i do n't like the fish i think i 'll have to try it .
well i 'm not sure . i know i 'm not really in the mood for traveling . do you want to go ?
a private refrigerator is a great deal .
that sounds like a good idea .
i 'd rather have tea .
i 'll have a glass of water then .
i prefer not to sit on the back of the way but i 'd like a little milk .
sure . what kind of milk do you want ?
no thanks . i 'm full .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
i 'm sorry to hear that . i 'll call her now and we can talk about it .
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she crazy ?
yes she 's alright .
i know . but she probably wo n't be able to help us .
ok .
ok . we 'll call you later .
ok . thank you .
i 'm not sure . i have to go to the supermarket .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm just putting on my books .
you do n't have to pay the fine .
it was n't cold out this morning .
i 'm sorry to hear that . why do n't you call the police ?
i 'm afraid we 're going to have to wait for the next few days .
i see . do you think our waitress is coming to a doctor ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . i think we can get some other drinks .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on .
how long has this been going to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
it 's supposed to be raining in the morning .
i think it 's just a crush . you ca n't be serious . you ca n't be serious .
no thank you . i do n't like tea at all .
i know . it 's really nice talking to you .
i 'm sorry . i 'll get you another one .
i was told to call the police this morning and call the police immediately . i m not sure i ll get the police to take the police with .
no it was n't . . . i thought it was right to be a conversation . but i still think it s still a truth .
i know ! i am really trying to be my best friend and i can t do that .
well i was wondering what you said last week i ve been in physics class for years ! look at these five men in the middle of the middle . now that s the matter ! the matter is it you can t just move that day !
ok . i ll go and where is your favorite coffee ?
wow you really have a talent like a job .
i feel as if i am a little <unk> .
hey look at these five men ! they are spending so much time at home !
yes that 's the one .
you can have a bird <unk> . .
yes that 's right .
so you 're saying that you 're paying with a new car ?
oh no ! it 's so dangerous .
really ? that s fantastic ! what do you think about your goals ?
you do n't need to use my computer to deal with that .
yes it is .
i m not crazy about it but i m not crazy about it .
i think you should try to patch things up .
thank you rick . we ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams brazil and china face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . without a doubt both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match .
i m not sure . it s just that the ref is coming in and i can t believe it !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center of the play in the play and he shoots ! wow you took the sound <unk> ! and he scores !
okay now you play the ball . . . the puck is back in play and he takes it straight for a half hour . he shoots ! and he scores ! he scores !
what an amazing goal !
that 's true . you see there are still 5 opportunities for new york . you can get a job .
i 'd rather not . i could go out for a few days .
i do n't know .
i do n't think so .
i think it is a fantastic idea .
i 'm afraid i do n't think i can afford it .
i 'm here on business .
what happened ?
yes here you are .
yes . but you must take the wrong direction .
that 's good advice .
i 'm glad to hear that .
aisle please .
let me see . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take this one .
here you are .
oh i 'm fine thank you .
do you have any special brand ?
no thank you . i 'll take this one .
you can see the library on the left .
that 's great ! i 'd like to see the results of our company .
i 'm sorry . i ca n't believe it .
i 'm afraid not . i 've got an important meeting to attend tomorrow morning .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon .
ok . i 'll call the police if you want .
yes .
thank you .
yes . if you take the train it will be late .
well i see . thank you .
the meeting will be held on the first of august fifth and the second of april .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'll be able to attend the meeting right now .
we are planning to sign up for a meeting at the moment .
that 's fine . i 'll do it .
yes that 's right . you have to do it .
yes i 'd like to . i 'm going to travel abroad .
where are you planning to go ?
i 'm going to do some shopping .
yes i have been busy emptying the packing boxes and cleaning up the mats . right now it looks like a home .
i see . well then you can go to the supermarket nearby . that way i will have to take the train .
i 'm afraid not . i 'm going to be busy tomorrow .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s going to be a little more exciting than any other countries . how much is the rent for a living ?
i like the big city life there .
i think that that that i should go out for a holiday too .
i guess i might just have a little time for a vacation .
i m afraid that s the only way to get a passport from you and that s my news .
thank you .
i 'm sorry i did n't hear you .
it 's a great school .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
look out she 's dressed .
i 'm not surprised . she 's so tall and slim .
but she means a lot to me .
well i guess you can rest assured .
i do n't think so .
i 'm sorry . i thought you must have taken it .
why not ?
i 'm not sure . perhaps i can help her .
i think it 's time for the kids to get together .
it was fantastic ! i have never had a chance to get away from home !
well it 's a little late . i 'm going to have to get an appointment with you .
i was going to go to the university of ohio in america .
did you go to the top of the eiffel tower ?
yes i did . did you get the letter from the bookstore ?
sure . i 'll just give them a call .
i 'm not sure . i think i 'll buy one for you .
you 're right . this one is very nice .
i 'm not sure . i just bought it for me and i 'm going to be late .
you did a great job . you must have had a great time .
i said i was in a car of the pool . i guess it was too cold .
that 's fine . i 'll be happy to help you .
yeah i told you we should go to the gym to celebrate . it was scary but it was not just that exciting !
that 's a good idea . that sounds like fun .
i 'm fine thanks .
i 'm fine .
yes i have . i only had a few pictures of all kinds of sports channels .
well you 've come to the right place . i 've never seen one of them since i was in college . i 've seen the american dream of the world . it 's so different from the united states .
exactly ! it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
i know . it was a great game .
yes absolutely not .
i know . i 've been here for 20 years and i have been in love with you .
what does it look like ?
i do n't think so . who is the president of the united states ?
i 'm afraid it 's too loud .
yeah . it seems she already got married in the western world .
it 's not just spreading out to a family relationship with us .
do people get along well with each other ?
how do you know you think so ? you are a good team player .
i 'm not really sure . what 's it about ?
then let 's go in .
ok .
i 'm sorry . i ca n't understand that .
i ca n't agree more .
you 're kidding !
yes he 's really pushed me too far .
i 'm sorry . i did n't know you were in a class .
i 'm not sure . he just broke up with his girlfriend recently and i do n't think he 's in the mood to start again .
i do n't think so . maybe it 's just too late .
i will .
you are not kidding .
you are right . maybe chinese is more beautiful than chinese .
i do n't know . i do n't know what 's the matter ?
that 's right . but i think they will be less expensive than that .
that 's true . you should be careful when you talk to the teacher .
well the other people use the same amount but the same . the other one i know is a friend of a friend . i do n't know how to do the same thing . it 's a good friend in the office .
i think so .
i think so .
i do n't know .
i don t have a problem with a double a double a double room .
she 's a famous american girl .
that 's right . i 'll tell him that you are paying for in the future . thank you for your interest .
do you know many people get married ?
well i would like to be a senior guest lawyer if i could .
he said he had to get rid of it . he said he had to get rid of it .
sure . here you are .
i 'm not sure .
don t worry . i m going to get you to a hospital . i m going to have to take you to an xray to see a doctor .
is your pin number on the left ?
i 'm glad to hear that .
oh i am sorry . but i still think you two should be more careful about her .
i said i was going to go to the library .
yeah . but they think it 's just too different to be true .
it 's kind of a big favor .
she 's probably right . she 's the right person to get into the office and is driving up the office every day .
that 's right .
do you have any idea where he is ?
well it 's true . we chinese have a traditional marriage but we do n't even know what we do .
i 'm not sure if you 'll be satisfied with your initial performance . you 'll find our requirements for this product in your end .
it 's a place to go to a certain amount of a little while to go with .
i know . i 'm really not so sure .
i think the kitchen is a little too . do you want to see it ?
it 's a great idea . i can search for a few other one .
are there many benefits that will be a lot of things in life ?
i know . i think that maybe you are right .
it 's a taiwanese puppet doll .
ok .
it 's a good idea . the coffee and the rice bar is a little different from the sun .
that sounds good .
i do n't like winter but i do n't like summer . it 's so hot .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 degrees .
i think the biggest cold in winter is more beautiful than the summer .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning .
that 's right . what about the cold weather in your city ?
yes there are many cities which are very cold in winter and we do n't have a cold weather in winter .
yes . we have a few newspapers on the fifth floor . would you please put the name for the 3rd of the train ?
have you ever seen a lot of them ?
yes i have . i went there once last summer . it was very beautiful .
i think that the olympics is a good thing .
i think that the water is a great place for a change of water . it is sure to put on the swimming pool .
i think the country is a little tight but i would like to go back to the university of south .
is that so ?
it sure is . but it 's not so hot .
i think so . the big compared with the people is worth visiting .
that 's a great idea . they have many unique flowers . i think they are the best known .
that s a great idea . there are many small islands off the coast of the park there . they have many small islands off for people .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . you also have a rivers but only a few lakes .
the european union has been very hot there . have you ever been in the united states ?
yes it s a small world . there s a big problem with the air .
i think that the government should do something about it . the government could provide some money for the environment .
that s a great idea . that s a bad drug addicts . a lot of the crime in crime and that doesn t have a drug time to lose in the mornings .
that s a good idea . you don t have a very good point . a lot of a tough approach is better than other people do .
i think that a good idea . i think that we can make a good decision .
that s a good idea . i m really looking forward to redoing my bedroom .
i ve been to most of the countries in asia korea and thailand and thailand and thailand and thailand and the united states and canada .
oh i see . i ve been to florida several years . i think that you ve been there for a long time .
i 've been to australia for australia . i 've been to the united states but i was born here on business and i do n't think i can afford to go to australia .
i like traveling for a holiday . i think i ve seen the exhibits in the united states .
isn t it really cold there ?
yes it is . it s usually cold in the winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
certainly .
i think that the romans do what everyone else does .
certainly .
how do you know so much about them ?
i do n't know .
i wonder how long this weather can last .
you are really a good citizen .
i do n't think so .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon .
i think so . they think that they are just opera costumes .
no they do n't .
i think that i should try to get the indian information before i go to the united states .
it usually takes about 20 minutes to get to the city in the summer .
i 'm going to buy some books .
that 's a good idea .
i 'm sorry sir . i 'll check for you .
i think it 's a pity that i missed it .
i do n't think so . it 's a good hobby .
that 's a problem .
i do n't know . i 'm not really in the mood for anything .
well i guess i could help you with that .
i 'm going to the untied states for travel . what about you ?
i 'm sorry . i ca n't promise you .
yes that 's right . she 's an excellent memory .
i think you can find a place that is ok .
yes that 's right .
you can get a rest or you need a little practice . you can have a rest of your spare time .
what do you need to do ?
yes i 'm going to have to do a lot of research .

i 'm sorry to hear that . i could take a look at it this afternoon .
well it might be that i 'm going to have to take you to a hospital . i 'm sorry to hear that .
i 'm sorry . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . can i recover from the pain of smoke .

i do n't know .
i 'll have a refund for you right now .
no i do n't have any one to me .
i m sorry . i didn t know you were in the mood for it .

i 'm not sure . my name is michelle and i 'd like to change it for you .
i see . thank you .
no .
i 'll just check for you .

well i m glad to hear that .
thank you very much .
it s my pleasure .
no thank you .
you re welcome .
yes i m happy to hear that .
i 'm afraid not .
that 's right .
in what way can we solve the problem ?
well as we say we get the fine .
i know . however we do n't have to raise these items . but all our prices are subject to our imports .
well the procedure is very simple and convenient . you can get on the subway and then change the subway . it will be much cheaper than the subway .
i see . well it 's about the same payment but it 's about time i leave it in 30 minutes .
you should take them with the computer and make some copies of the computer and make them which is better than you do .
that 's fine .
you can rest assured of that . you can rest assured that we 'll do better in the future .
i 'm sorry to hear that but you 've got to take a break from the doctor .
i guess i should .
i 'm going to miss you but i 'm going to have to cancel the full details .
i 'm going to go abroad .
i 'm sorry sir but i 'll have to call you back .
yes i 'm used to learn a lot about it but i 'm not familiar with processing management information and i do n't know how to use it .
you 're welcome .
yes . i 've found some wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful clothes in your paper .
do you have any other outside income ?
yes it is .
that 's good !
it 's a really important issue . you can use the stations for free . besides it is convenient for the internet and it can be used for many weeks .
that 's a good idea .
i will . i will go to the library and have them bought for you .
that 's a good idea . i ll take it .
i know . i 'll look forward to it .
how about the memory ?
i 'm sorry but i ca n't . i 'll get you to the ladies room .
that s a good idea .
yes i did . i enjoyed it .
i m glad to hear that . did you join the sales department ?
i ll be glad to be able to come in tomorrow .
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
see you .
that s great . i m a good manager .
what ?
i had a perfect plan for this job but i am not sure how to do it .
how much do you think you spend ?
i am not crazy about it but i just want to try something else .
hi jack i 'm just watching tv .
you 're going to have to do something romantic .
that 's right . i 'll tell you what i can do .
i 've heard about that but i 'm not sure of it .
yeah . i can get a few video tv .
what else do you have in mind ?
it means that no parking meter .
that 's very sensible . it sounds reasonable .
i 'm afraid we have no choice . our prices are reasonable . but i ca n't afford to place the price of the house . i 'm afraid we ca n't afford to place the large order with them . it would be so large .
i 've already given you a discount of 20 to 80 .
i 'm afraid that 's the point . our goods are to be <unk> . we ca n't be able to make any further reduction of ten percent .
i can get a search for a job at the local newspaper .
that 's true . i think the price is a little lower than the others . but what you pay for the old and the sales you get for a low price ?
it 's not too bad . well it 's not like the color i want .
i 'm glad to hear that . we 'll be interested in the tender notice of the month .
it 's not too bad for me but it 's not really cheap for me . how much is it ?
sure . i 'll be glad to do that .
i see . what about the expression goodbye ?
yes we do . we can provide a tailored consultation service for you giving us a discount of 5 days .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you here .
it usually takes 3 hours to 6 days .
i see . do you have any ideas for me ?
all right .
well we can sign up for it together .
what is the current product ?
i 'm glad to hear that .
i 'm not sure . i know i 'm going to buy a computer for my trip .
that 's a good idea . i 'll take this one .
i do n't think that it 's a good idea .
i can see that . do you have your appointment ?
i was watching it for three days .
what time ?
it was four o 'clock .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon .
i would like to make a reservation for a single room with a bath from the afternoon of october 10th to the morning of next week .
okay . i 'll see you tomorrow then .
how about 7 o 'clock ?
i can t give you the day off .
hi dr . smith . i ve been getting ready for a week . thanks for coming to see me . i am putting you down for a little bit of a little while .

ok thank you ! where should i go ? i need to go now . thanks for calling .
absolutely not ! you are highly contagious ! you don t want to infect the rest of your coworkers do you ?
thank you for me but i would be a little tired . i really have to work so hard . i m afraid i can t t get to the office for being late .
haha . you are my secretary . you should have this in mind not let me know . you have a bad cold . if you have to ask me any questions . if you would like to ask me .
ok . thank you !
i am sorry to hear that .

i sure did .
you can buy them at the entrance .
they were all sitting in the living room watching tv and movies . they had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house . if you had hit them they might have to go to the hospital .
how much did you pay ?
i think the government should take a few problems .
it must be difficult to get to the police station .
yes .
yes i do .
i m not in the mood for traveling .
well maybe you 're right . but i think it 's too late to watch a movie .
perhaps you considered the foreign language score . how about the subjects you ve made ?

i do n't know .
you must be joking .
yes i have . i watched it on tv yesterday .
i m going to stay there for a few days .

well we still have about ten kids . they are not sure . how about a tongue ?
we 'll be here for about forty .
i see . is it the same as the one you have now ?
yes i know . but you have to be punctual .
it depends on how much you spend . if you want to withdraw money the money the interest is a little high it would cost me a little more than a month .
that 's fine . i 'll take it .
i 'm not sure but i think it 's worth trying to get a credit limit .
i need to cancel a check .
you know the bank is a little low but you can pay the minimum of the amount of dollars .
how much is that ?
yes we do . we have a dryer too .
that 's right . i 'll go through the materials that you require ?

i 'm sorry . i did n't realize that .
that 's fine . is there any minimum for the first deposit ?
yes i would like to change some money please .
oh yes . i 'm glad to hear that . is there a problem ?
yes of course . the account is a compound savings account which is in the past .
ok .
how long do you offer ?
i 'm glad to hear that . but i 'm glad to hear it .
yes of course . but i 'm afraid you will have to take the subway .
i would like to know about fees .
what kind of property is it ?
it s not exactly what i want .
well the standard card has a lower credit limit .
i 've got it .
what 's the problem ?
ok . . . . well i want to take a look at some of our services .
thank you .
that 's very unbelievable . by the way how much do you suggest the cost of living here ?

thank you .

that 's ok . but what if it is a place where you can get it from .
i 'm afraid not . but i 'd like to be able to have this route .
all right . please wait a moment .
yes . but according to the usual practice it is not beyond the conditions of the contract . you can be assured of that .
well i 'm afraid there is no room for any reduction in price .
i have a headache .
i 'm afraid it ca n't be helped . the trouble is that serious .
i do n't think it was the least we could make the final decision . the inspection fee is the same .
thank you mr . jackson . i think i ll be able to appreciate it .
we would like to make an offer of three parts of the agreement .
the mushrooms were packed in small plastic bags to be packed in a carton .
i see . thank you .
ok . i 'll take a look .
i 'm not sure .
that 's very sensible . can you give me a ring with you ?
can you tell me something about the future ?
i 'm afraid not . we ca n't make any difference .
let me see . you must take it up with the shipping space .
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree with you there . we have quotation from other sources such as the price of credit and the price would be too high .
i 'm glad to hear that . but what do you suggest we do ?
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
i 'd like to try on the first draft but i 'd like to send it to you tomorrow .
no thank you .
that 's a good idea . can you book the tickets ?
well i 'll be back in about an hour .
i 'm glad to meet you too .
i do n't like it . i do n't like it .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
ok . we will send the customer service and sign it back to you .
we re going to need to improve our export business relations between our two countries . we also have a longterm relationship with your catalogues and crafts . besides i would like to start with your corporation .
we can make a decision to arrange for you to double the first two or three days before the end of the month .
i 'm glad to hear that . what do you need to do ?
that 's great . i 'll go over to that .
i 'm sorry i do n't know . i 'm wrong . i 'm going to change my job .
i 'm sorry but we do n't have any reservation .
we usually do n't give you an immediate answer of our business relations between our two parties . but if you can pay the commission of the amount of the european market we can reduce the order of 10 .
i would like to purchase it for you .
oh i see . i think they must be the wrong information .
no problem .
i 'll need a few minutes to get the relevant information and come back for a week .
i 'm afraid not . we ca n't give you any discount of that . we ca n't give you any discount on the time . if you order we ca n't give you any discount of 10 .
i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon .
that 's a big bonus for the employees . now that 's a little high .
i 'm afraid we have no choice but we have n't had any problems in the contract .
i 'm afraid we ca n't . we only accept our relatively small order of 10000 units .
i 'm afraid not . our price is too high . we ca n't give you any discount on the high side of that .
how long is it going to take to get there ?
thank you for your cooperation .
thank you ! i 'll be back in later on today .
that 's a good idea .
ok . i 'll see you tomorrow then .
what time is the meet ?
yes it is .
i see .
i hope you 'll be able to make it .
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree with you here .
what 's the problem ?
i 'm afraid it 's too late .
that 's ok .
it 's the best time for you to say .
ok sir . we will send someone to your room right now .
thanks .
what time is your appointment ?
i 'm afraid we ca n't . we 've already quoted in our <unk> .
i 'm glad to hear that .
i 'm afraid not .
well i 'm afraid we ca n't finish it on time .
i think we should work out more often .
i 'm afraid we ca n't finish it until 10 o 'clock .
i 'm afraid that the prices are too difficult to promote our price .
i see . will you pay me cash ?
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent .
yes it sure does .
it 's already reduced 20 .
well i 'll try .
i 'm sorry but we ca n't make any difference .
i see . that 's our usual practice . what about the balance of payment ?
it would be ok if you could meet me at the first of your company .
well i can explain that . but i must say that if you are eligible for it .
i 'm afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .
i 'm sorry but i ca n't . i do n't think i can manage it .
yes i 've finished . here 's my form and my old card .
thank you .
i want it to be perfect .
ok . here you are .

the usual rate is 1 rib .
what kind of account do you want to open ?
here you are .
it 's not too bad . you see i 've already found a credit limit .
