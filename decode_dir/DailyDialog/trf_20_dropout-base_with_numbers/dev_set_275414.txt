we can take a bus there .
does this bus go there ?
i think so .
what ideas do you have if we employ you ?
no it 's too crowded .
dad . here comes another bus .
fine . let 's get on . oh no judy ! get off the bus quickly !
why ? dad ?
we got on the wrong bus .
hold on please .
sure .
three calls and there will be no use for the show .
you 're kidding ! you 've been sitting there for 20 minutes .
yes . what 's the problem ?
is he your home ?
yes please tell her i stopped by .
tom has gone to lunch .
for the environment and gas .
do you think this music is warm matched ?
oh that means i ca n't make sure for my own .
i am going to the railway station .
it depends on the job . it 's actually more costeffective than buying specialist equipment that we do n't use very often .
do you want to go to an office ?
let 's meet in front of the abc school .
how long will it take me to get there ?
well do i have to pay to use it ?
there is no one here by that name .
please hold on a second .
maybe next weekend . she only mentioned this before she left .
let 's hurry . i 'm starving !
sorry he 's not here at the moment .
oh yeah . this is david coming to college . is he coming to the hotel with mr . li ?
i do n't know . but i 'll have an appointment for you tomorrow .
what can i do for you ?
he is in the bedroom .
what 's the matter ?
do you know which one he would like ?
you bet . i was supposed to call my mother an hour ago .
it 's too professional . i thought i 'd fall in love with you .
of course i am the luckiest guy in the world .
oh i 'd like to .
i 'm glad to meet you . my name is joey . welcome to the hotel .
it feels all right . but if it were a darker color i 'd like it better . this seems too light for winter . do you think you could get me one ?
it 's my pleasure .
this one is ok . it 's bigger than the blue building . there 's one i got .
i think i 'd better have a look at the menu .
when is it ?
ok . i will just use my key card .
right .
cool down harry !
what time is it now ?
oh that 's all right . i just wondered what was keeping you .
oh it should be here in 5 minutes .
is it expensive to go in the evening ?
yes i do . you can go to the transport department to get yourself a bus schedule and a bus route map .
really ? that 's not a bad idea . let 's go !
oh no you are not . i think you can get there in the traffic .
i want to pick up my parcels .
yes you can .
thanks a lot .
you are welcome .
oh no . it 's from the other side of the tv .
the test tomorrow .
what size do you like ?
no i 'd like to do something special for you on your birthday .
have n't i asked you to call if you 're going to be home late ?
no i have n't .
let 's see . from here you have to take the 278bus .
i hate the bus system in london ! the bus drivers are rude the buses are never on time and there are few people around who can help you .
you should get off at the first shi da stop .
ok thanks . . .
bye bye bye .
no is it difficult ?
no it 's quite simple . when you get on just ask the bus driver when to pay the fare and where you want to get off .
how much does it cost ?
this one is 1500 yuan .
wow i ca n't thank you enough .
do n't mention it .
i would like to open another account .
what size prints would you like ?
some of them are already here .
good idea .
i 'm not sure of that .
say for calling .
yes i 'd like to have the both hair and the black one .
70 yuan .
ok . there is about a quarter to seven .
yes . i think you 'll like your new computer .
well i am a size 6 .
one last question . where is your destination ?
i prefer the blue one .
it seems a little too hard for me to get done .
do you promise ?
my boss will be there in the hospital as soon as possible . can you please pick them up ?
yes . please help me a couple of minutes .
so you may consider the new product and make sure they are used to be twice as a person .
yes . i 'll show you to your office at <unk> .
do you want it urgently ?
yes . i m trying to find a pair of earrings to match my necklace . can you recommend some to me ?
over there .
i am afraid it is too big .
can you give me some description of your case ?
could i purchase euro with rib here ? i have to stay in bed for months .
i love the wine . what would you like to have ?
could i have a fresh towel ?
can you weigh them please ?
yes one last thing . how much holiday time do you give your employees every year ?
i would like to open another account .
doctor i think i 'll have a tomato juice .
i am a nurse at a chinese restaurant .
what a pity !
ok . i think i 'll take it .
you 're selling invoking subscriptions like nobody 's business . and we do n't even have a working <unk> yet .
is that right ?
you mean dozens of the company actually help ?
do i have to get up now ?
remember to come with me next time .
what 're you talking about ? my alarm even has n't gone off yet .
your clock never works . perhaps you should go to the dentist .
i must have slept right through it .
rise and shine ! sleepyhead !
it 's on me to the hotel near the hotel .
what 's the matter ?
yes maybe it does . but if you 're going to drive like you did just now you will have to get used to a little physical pain . you know what i mean ?
oh yeah . i ca n't wait to go there with my friends .
it 's my pleasure to be here with you .
so what is it going to cost them ?
we could go to the park more often .
that 's true . if you try my size and your clothes will be perfect .
no way !
i was thinking of seeing you me and dupree . it 's a typical hollywood blockbuster .
good idea . i am really behind of your work .
no how do you mean ?
it 's great to hear .
i m going to the railway station .
that 's harsh .
so are you going to be taking anything ?
no i 'll make sure and get the book .
how about this one ?
i prefer the novels by hemingway such as the old man and the sea . i like the simple words in his novels .
this is my first time washing clothes .
here 's your money .
i 'm sorry about that . i 'll get you a new one .
really ? how much is it ?
i 'm sorry . i really must go now .
that 's a good deal .
sorry to say that we will either make a further reduction of 50 .

i 'll go and get some snacks .
yes . we are on the list of courses .
thank you very much .
no problem . would you like some artificial carnations ?
oh no . carnations are not very elegant . artificial flowers have no passion .
how much did you want to spend ?
money is no object .
our most elegant flower is golden lily .
i will take ten .
do you want to add some baby s breath for that ? they are equally popular now .
of course . can you take my picture with me ?
yes but there is a five dollars delivery charge .
that 's ok . here is the address .
i would like to open another account .
no i 'll see you tomorrow .
oh these are exactly what i m looking for .
that 's right .
these two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . others are ordinary letters .
that 's right . try not to interrupt them at all .
you know in china is a must . some chinese culture have been experiencing less than 25 years of life .
the copier is right .
it 's nice . can i try it on ?
50 .
oh dear . it 's too expensive . can you give me a better price ?
my cousin is in front of me . what do you do ?
on a cell phone ?
but she feels like having no appetite at all .
oh i 'm sure i 'll get used to seeing my parents .
okay thanks . my wife 's baby .
i see . well why do n't we watch them for a long time ? i m tired of going to the police station .
i love you .
no wonder ! i ve been driving a lot more money !

i never go to places . i used to live out at least once a week .
what do you mostly do during your workout ?
i sometimes watch a lot of sports and it is very difficult to learn .
in that case you want to work with less weight . you can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . five kilo weights should be enough . now it s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .
about three times a week if i can .
i would like to open another account .

i want to give you a word that is really meaningful .

i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
there 's a charge on the meter .

yes . but there is a desk in the hotel .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks .
probably not .
how many nights a week is it ?
it 's only thirty yuan .
can i pay by card ?
ok . here are several kinds of books .
there 's a charge on the meter .

i think a cab is better .
oh excellent . how much does it cost ?
you re welcome .
sorry . i 'll bring you a receipt for you .
can you make my hair short ?
well . cantonese food is rather light beijing food is heavy and sichuan food is usually hot and spicy .

i want the best one . i want a the best one .
no problem . what do you want to get ?

it 's very nice . i like it very much .
it 's very confusing . do you want to live in a different color ?
i 'm not sure . i think we should wear this one .

of course . the fitting room is this way please .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?

we have a lot of <unk> on our own .
what other sources of energy do you have for the goods ?
how much is the tour ?
i understand . but why wo n't you show me the logo ?

well i can just trade with the point of making a final decision . it 's about time !
what happened ?
a copy of the store is available .
i would like to open another account .
yes why do n't you try this one on ?
i do n't like the way to wear .

just make a quick decision . this is nice and easy . let 's go get some .
well this is just too awkward . . . she 's better than keeping things so it s just like i 'm here . .
what is that ?
is it good ?
it s all greek to me .
well i see .
an average ten feet ?
hmm . i think it s not fair .
yes .
are you ready to transfer tomorrow ?
silly me .
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
anything you say ?
i 'll give you five more minutes then i 'm going on without you !
yes i bought a few things .
well you can watch them yourself . you can watch tv now .

i hope you ll fix it soon .
it 's too bad to have taken care of . but now it 's too hot for me to get used to the bus .
it is unnecessary .
you 'll see the national bank near the war memorial . it 's a big building and you 'll see a big bus .
it looks like you have a car .
thank you .
i do n't think so . i have to tell you something about it .
thank you .

i feel like having a coke .

if you 're so sure he would be a politician .
yes someone just sent it in please .
you forgot ? you . . .
i see .

can you come back in the morning or would you prefer to come back in the afternoon ?
do you want to take a walk ?
i appreciate your understanding .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
oh no i just couldn t . i had a bad start i was late last night .

thank you .
yes . no need to change .
how far is it ?
you re welcome .
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
that d be great but could i have a cup of tea first ?

that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .
i see . well i can help with the chores while i m here . you two could probably use my help .

oh well . i 'll have to live with it . what else can i do ?
yes it 's very close .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that might be going overboard a bit . how about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . ok i 'll take it .
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing .
that s even better than the real thing .
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than 100 you get a 50 voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
sure . the fitting room is right over there .

good .
? i 'll take it .
yes i buy one especially the food there .
unfortunately our summer does not come with cards . but we can only get a discount because the government has become international calls and that many different conditions .
what is your major ?
i think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than atm processing speed .
can you give me a copy of the tour guide ?
yes i can . it was very expensive and it is very convenient .
not really but they are all working on it .
i want to try on this pair .
the round shape pair ?
what sports do you like best ?

it sounds interesting . i 'll take one .
here we go .
it tastes great .
enjoy yourself .
yeah .
no just the chicken . i like some more ice cream .
i want a rice wine too . what about that ?
it 's a hotel but cheaper and offers free parking .
i 've never had a try .
if you take coffee with cream it will make you feel well with the tea .
are you kidding me ?
no thank you . they look delicious .
i d like to have the coffee rum pies .
how 's your diet coming into the heat ?
of course ! i have no idea what to eat .
please give me a piece of pie first .
maybe you have but i think it 's time for chinese food .
of course . the sliced noodles they offer are among the most authentic shanti cuisines .
blah . . . what 's that ?
no problem . i ll go right now .
what do you mean by that ?
you 're welcome .
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
me too . i think i 'll go and get my food there .
how much is it for me to buy some souvenirs ?
i 'm not sure yet . something else please do n't know how to deal with .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .

yes ?
um this steak i asked for to be medium rare .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
she 's in a meeting now .
is she old or young ?
what did you do ?
we 've got to write you a ticket and <unk> your vehicle .
now everything 's in order .
i can t find out if you d like .
what do you think of it ?
why do n't you use wooden cases ?
are you scared of anything ?

that 's true . she looks very attractive .
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it s about an hour .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
all right .

what ? you 're just a little tired . i 'm worried about something .
have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
it 's ok with me . but i am broke now .
you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
is there anything else ?
are you interested in today 's special ?

is there a laundry ?
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
i 've never had a mango .
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
we can eat more water and increase the cost of living .
mangoes ? what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
can you eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
maybe i could read it .
it 's 150 yuan a month .
then i do n't think i 'm going to need them .

how much are they ?

what does a mango taste like ?
they 're like a citrus fruit .
how do i know if it 's ripe ?

let 's see . yes this autumn is the latest model .
would you like another beer ?
well the riverside mall has 200 stores in it including four major department stores .
i like your wife s chicken .
follow me . what do you want me to do ?
any place will be fine .
oh yes . it s just a few minutes walk . turn left at the traffic light and you ll see it .
ok thank you .
i m <unk> . my name is li jean .

i think the traffic might be too heavy .
i think it 's a cab .
yes almost all the families have their own cars .
will you be serious ?

don t worry . i guess we ll make it .
well could you pick up some sugar ?

i think i ll beat you .
i think terrible old thing did n't he ?
maybe you re right . this s a good idea .
true . anyway the traffic is <unk> fast .
is it very quiet ?
it 's normal .
do you need a house or something ?
i like living in a more relaxed and beautiful scenery .
do you know how espresso has been ?
ok . i 'll send it by myself .
what account would you like to be paid ?
yes it is . should i give you some advice ?
yes it is . but you can t get up early enough to go .
good idea . would you mind telling me the exact information about the company ?
where to ?
please take me to this address .
that 'll be fine .
i have to be there before <unk> .
sure . then i 'll be free from nine to eleven .
400 yuan a month .
i 'll do that .
here 's twenty dollars .
well it 's 12 .
oh i see .
please fill out this form and we 'll need to see if it 's normal .
yes i do .
hello madam . where to ?
could you please help me put my bags in the truck ?
oh right . thank you .
i 'm completely lost . i 'm looking for an article .
100 rib . but we will give you a discount on each month .
here 's 50 yuan .
it is located at the east foot of western mountain of beijing in a park with the same name . there are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer so it is called fragrant mountain .
you 'll get used to it . really ?
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
do you have a seat available ?
it 's a pleasure to have this opportunity .
hello . is there anything i can do for you ?
yes ?
do you mean the suspect ?
no i 'm not . i 've just come back from the states yesterday .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
okay but the sent me three times this week .
see you then .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i ll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello brian !
wow what a pity !
it was almost two years ago . i went to the office of the office the other day and i 'm having an important meeting .
i am very well thank you .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
well talk to you about it .
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
of course ! if you do n't mind i will call you if you can .
thank you very much .
do n't you hit it off ?
i began to went there last month .
i see .
i 've had a terrific working relationship with my boss . she told me i 'm always tired of working .
what does your sister do ?
well since it 's not too much trouble to start a car i suppose .
why ? i do n't believe he would do that .
what happened ?
thank you . see you then .
but i need to be there . i have to go .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
no you do n't ! i 'll take the car and the bank to take your money .
what are you talking about ?
yeah ! i m going to cut down on the caffeine !
what 's the fire control ?
do you think it s a lot of fun ?
uh well i 'll just check . . . i 'm gonna put them in a couple of minutes .
some computer games are great ! we 'll check out some magazines and games .
i know i know . i m not going to put a red light .
i m looking for a sweater .
have you brought your credentials ?
i ll need a check . i don t think i ll need a polaroid .
have you watched your favorite book on the yellow shelf ?
yes . the traditional cpa certificate has a must be good rule about the original certificate and the certificate of individuals .
sure i can go to the supermarket by the door .
your garden is really lovely .
so we can eat a lot of water and ball .
it is nice to see you again too .
i d suggest that one of the largest sports package in the world .
wait a minute ! this is a light ! it should be on the back of my hotel .
that s amazing ! but who can you do it ?
and how do you think it is that the most suitable job ?
please say it 's very nice . but not really .
well it s true . if you can give me the system i can talk to the department .
that s true but try here .
thanks for saying so !
no problem anytime .
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
is this salami and bologna you have here ?
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes . i 'm just here about an hour ago .
is this your country ?
so you can work out the details of this report ?
maybe you have some idea how to use it . they will get used to the teacher 's bathroom . you know in the mail all the way up to the others .
so it s good to hear from you .
it could be a little more expensive sir . you ll have to pay for it .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
what size are you ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's one thing . i 'm going to have to let you do some jogging . maybe you can get a tired .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s a great balcony with an incredible view of the park .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
maybe i ll get some new furniture . better stuff .
do you need to buy lots of things on sale ?
yes it has two bedrooms . that 's convenient .
can we have the bill now ?
the rent is 1500 per month .
that s way too much .
you re not going to be able to make it a cheaper one .
what do you mean ?
let me see . 200 dollars .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you like to order anything else ?
okay . in my opinion she ll give me a secret .
i m afraid not . but i m going to be late at night .
i love it . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . it gives me a real sense of satisfaction . do you enjoy cooking ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is the big difference not the ingredients .
really ? i like authentic chinese food .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
very well . your document will be ready by thursday at 400 pm .
how much is this one ?
the color i am sure does n't work out the color . i am sure that one will suit me .
you have made a good choice in the price .
it s going to be too expensive maybe something .
just about . i ll do it for you .
i see . your library card is on the high side of your room . would you like to buy one ?
the red one made in black . can i try it on ?
if you need anything else just let me know .
what kind of dress is it ?
even if you like to go to the library you can take a look at the magazine .
thanks .
this is the property manager . how can i help you ?
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i really want to have a home with a shower .
i can help you find one for you .
that sounds good . see you then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
how about the museum of modern art ?
yes . nice to meet you .
should i bring anything with me ?
no but if you need to check your driver 's license just give me the form and i 'll be happy to see you .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
but the price has been reduced by 50 .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it has great curb appeal .
the house is so beautiful right now .
it must be the best choice . the market is very high .
with so few windows how can you even see what the problems are ?
that 's a nice sweater .
it looks good .
the best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom .
last night i tried a hundred percent discount but the price is too high .
usually about 30 people .
it is ! look at this little table sir . it is very beautiful and the design is now .
let s sign it for you .
what are you going to do ?
according to the book i can lend it to you .
it 's great . i 'll take a walk .
wow ! this place is really beautiful . what a great <unk> !
i thought it might rain today .
thanks .
<unk> .
i 'm sorry you are having a meeting tomorrow .
hello mr . clark . i am calling to confirm the appointment tomorrow .
oh ? where did you see it ?
i love this house . you know i don t like it very much .
i 'll pick you up at six o 'clock .
i appreciate your help .
it would n't be good if it got cold this weekend .
i 'll be waiting for you .
we have a deal with parents .
what do i need to do ?
no but if you bring some foldup chairs for people do you have any ? i 'm afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
yes i 'd like to change some money to cover my expenses here . what 's today 's rate of us dollar against the rib yuan ?
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
yes please .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
oh i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
do you know how short you want your hair to be ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
there 's a lot of things to do with you .
no thank you . the back and i d like a nonsmoking room please .
oh did you wear red clothes ?
no problem . i think it 's a little too long . leave just a little longer .
what style do you want ?
i hope so . i 'm not very happy at the moment .
as a matter of fact i would like to know more about your present job .
no you can cut down on the chair and i am going to a disco . then you 'll only be able to find your new fragrance .
it 's time to go . bye ella . hope to see you soon
to the right .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yeah . we should get what they really need .
oh i see . and may i ask you something ?
very generous of you .
it 's <unk> .
oh that 's nice of you . thanks a lot .
yes . we 'll be here for you .
ok . i 'll pick you up at your hotel at eight .
all right . you are quite sure to put the vase in a few days .
that 's probably a good idea .
oh yes . i know that 's my problem . what do you think about this ?
so what ? are you used to wear this house ?
ok . i ll help you with the food there .
ok let 's go check out the bedroom and find a new carpet .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
ok .
yes but do you remember what we thought ? it was very good .
yes i work very hard .
where is it ?
so you will ask the bank to pay for it . if one hundred and fifty thousand dollars the total amount of money will be deducted .
great . we can go look at a shop sometime next week .
is that very expensive ?
where is it ?
did you ever ask him ?
because i am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !

but coffee is very good .
what ? is n't the phone charge for these days ?
sounds like you 're really <unk> . i 'll try it .
you 've got it ! but are you sure you 're going to like the invitation ?
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?

i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?

first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
yes . i have to go to the hotel nearby .

well . . . i guess i 'm in a bad mood for this .
that 's no problem . let 's just get a bus station from there .
not good . i lost my wallet .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
what can i do for you today ?
i got on about fifteen minutes ago .
o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room sir ?

you have your own vehicle ?
i do n't need a car . i walk to work .

yes i mean it .
i am glad that you think so .
i see .
hi peter . come on in .
oh i am just watching some television . what about you ?
really ? that 's great !
i thought about it .
the service this evening has been a great time since we last time .
i did !
you like panda express ?
well to be honest i ca n't say that long . i 've got a better offer .
well i hope you can help me a lot . did you want to leave your confirmation number of the company ?
i also want to have a large selection of film .
what kind of food are you talking about ?

oh hi mary . i 'm working on it .
if there 's no holdups .
we need to get a little exercise .
what happened ? did your son say something about it ?
sometimes when are you going to go do something i think you should tell her .
ok i will try my best to calm down . now just press the button like this .
but what do you think of the talking ?
oh a chinese girl have broken the world record in the olympic games
this is not what i asked for .
i can do that .
i have no idea .
where are you from ?
how do i use it ?
what can i help you with ?
i 'm trying to call my mother .
i am sorry sir . our company has been full up these days .
i went to the library and lost my bag .
don t worry about it ! we re going to have to cut back on the caffeine !
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
i thought he said there were some gaps in the <unk> why . he said there are some reasons for coming .
i think i want to try a new style .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
i have been studying . i will have passed the test .
i know how you feel . i thought maybe it was my fault .
no i have n't . i 'm going to travel very light this time .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
you mean next month .
i like business management and i think the best way to improve my english .
what 's your favorite dance ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
i do n't need a car . i walk to work .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
well there s nothing else i can do about it .
what 's the matter
the food station was as crowded as usual . i waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich and when i finally got it the chicken was underdone .
take it easy . i will build your deck with a good idea .
i bought one size up by mistake .
well we chinese food in sichuan food so we usually have to sichuan food . the hot and the most sichuan dishes are spicy and hot .
thanks .
i 'm fine . how about you ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
well i 'm from studying . i 'm an english major and these papers . i 've always been here for a long time .
it 's a good idea .
yes i see . but i think it 's still a pity that you 're interested in .
i 'll keep you in touch .
would you like cash back ?
goodbye . hope to see you again next year .
well all the brothers and sisters get together and fill the christmas stockings for the litt 1e kids .
i do n't know much about it .
because i am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !
i have the confidence in the language too . they 're all pretty confident and easy to understand .
if you have any questions about your salary we will send you an interview .
i think so . i am not good at this movie yet .
that 's all right .
i am worried about the meeting this morning .
there are many universities for you to choose from . some famous universities such as harvard yale the university of michigan and massachusetts institute of technology are really wonderful places to study but they are very competitive and expensive . some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper .
i have n't got it .
because i am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !
do i need to take a money from my bank 's account ?
english chemistry and physics are also the main source of human beings .
i really do n't know what the rent is . i 'm going to live in a retirement plan and it 's still more convenient . do you think i 'll have to rent the apartment ?
we can take the plane . it 's not far from there .

i think i 'll have a dahl .
you re going to take courses ?
yes i 'm going to take some university courses there .

i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
there is a registration ticket in front of the company .
you mean we could be together ?
yes . there is one on the other side of the building .
do you know if there 's a convenience store around here ?
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i am worried .

i feel very nervous about it .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i will go to the university of pennsylvania ave .

yeah me too . to get along with the colleagues and prepare some food for the final work .
what ? what do you mean ?
i agree . but i think it s time to take a break .
what do you mean ?
that s okay . i am sorry i still do business . this is a company rule . we don t have to pay extra for that .
i think you re right . maybe that s true .
ok .
great . thank you .
what can i do for you today ?
i need to get a passport .
what do you need help with ?
i need to talk to you about that new driver you ve hired . i think i am going to have some problems working with him .
did you check the periodicals ?
i didn t even bother to think of that .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
i see .
do you have any more skirts in this style ?
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
ah these are the ones . i bought them a lot of times last year .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
did you go to the top ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to open another account .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
can you show me which charges you re referring to ?

it takes a couple of days for the stuff . but if it 's not company i 'll change my mind .
i like it . well i 'll see how it goes .

no . i 've never had a lot of money in my life .
almost all of them are taken to the school .
moblogging is a combination of the word mobile and blogging . it means that i can deal with all kinds of people who live here .
i 'm not sure if she 'll be able to see that .
it 's a <unk> question . i guess it is n't too safe for us to pay a credit card .
well i made some final exam . the school came to my paper and dad was good at school . he just likes to play the piano for a week .
how about a china vase ?
that would be great . thanks for your help .

the same thing is that all of them are the same thing . i 'm not even ready to get my degree from the us .
there wo n't be any long lines .
that 's great ! thanks for your help .
our restaurant is joining us . however if you want to spend more money on a human resource we 'll have to promote the results . we can do some parttime work in the mornings and write down the street .
oh . i 'm glad to hear that . is it your first time to take a longdistance trip ?
the company is very important to me .
are you sure you can do it ?
okay .
good ! we will look into that new type of building painting . would you like to see a lot of other detective stories ?
there are several things that i like to do . i 've seen the most important thing is to be happy . they all break into the beginning of next year .
maybe you should try to tell your experience next time .
wow ! i 'm busy now . why do n't i go a new year ?

i will ask him .
maybe you are right .
but i like its color .
anyway it 's my ideal coat . i 'll take it .

but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to my liking too .

it 's my dream .
since last time we 've climbed the mountain we have to gone out for a long time .

yes it is .
where do you want to go ?
i see . well you have been working too hard or would you like to come in for a meeting ?
i m sorry sir . the train system is too busy . i don t think we ll have to get on the bus .
sir this is the only one hundred percent discount .
that sounds like a pretty wife to have more fun .
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
how many kids do you think you should do ?
cool . then maybe it must be very convenient .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
who won ?
well you 'll just have to put up with <unk> .
sounds interesting but soccer is really difficult to learn .
you were right it was from a headhunter . he would n't tell me anything without a signed contract .
it does n't matter . we 'll have to call the police .
i 'm afraid that i 'm tied up with her class .
you too . have you lost any weight ?
you know our products are very competitive . it s a most suitable place for all the world .
on the meter ?
thank you but i still do n't have a receipt .
it 's all right . there 's no trouble at all .
does this mean to run a lot of noise ?
thanks .
sure . it 's a very good choice but it 's not expensive .
then does it go well with my sweater ?
a sale store ?
exactly how would i know ?
you can twist your arm in order to have a control of your case .
i think she s playing a computer games .
not at all .
yes i do n't like the work .
do you know where your polling place is ?
i would say the same thing .
ok . let 's go .
she 's the one who saved the life of my son at the beach last year .
is she american ?
she was a bit nervous i guess .
in the united states i think i should do something useful .
i like she 's very nice and friendly .
oh i know i 'm not that . but i still think you 'd be making a good singer . how do you know that ?
i 've heard she had been our ups and downs .
i think that she is going to give you some advice .
no i did n't find her husband 's house .
well all the brothers and sisters get together and fill the christmas stockings for the litt 1e kids .

you know just did n't . every time you will turn left on the just push the button .
but it 's really very kind of you .
okay . i 'm his wife and i will be glad to get back to you .
yes . i 'm just pissed that management ca n't see behind his smooth talking lies .
i 'm so sorry . was there any other time ?
this is alex . remember ? this is her birthday .
the only thing is i can do is find out the reason why .
yes . it 's much better to meet my needs . what can i do for you ?
then when did i tell you ?
i 'm so sorry taylor . i do n't think she 's that too sad . i wish she was angry with you .
that 's too bad . but they just drove around two miles . that 's not as fast as we got .
no they did n't . i got a an passport and a photo of the school administration .
really ? i thought they were going to win .
for me i think i should have given our offer to the experience of making a decision .
that 's too bad .
you know i really do n't have time to watch a movie .
please wake me up at 6 am .
no . but you know that i fell in love with you at the first sight .
yes that 's right .
i 've already got one .
then i think you 're going to love it .
just a minute . i was told that we would have to come to the flea market to buy a bargain .
yes sir . now if you 'll just sign here please .
i pulled you over because your brake light is out .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
i watched buddha buyer go up to 315 . i waited until the very last minute and then i jumped in at 325 ! i sniped him !
how old is she ?
yes .
it 's perfect ! we 're so touched and i ca n't help bursting into the wedding .
it will be my pleasure to see you again . the plane leaves at two thirty .
i m afraid i can t make the reservation .
you said it . we 'll just have to get a discount .
yes it was very exciting though .
where will we be staying ?
what was that you just said ? last one . . . ? hey they 've closed the ticket window !
you re right . i ll end up starting next month .
i love it ! you know i could use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use it to home .
so you can write down your name card number and address in detail .
a lot of things . there is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . you really should read it .
wow ! that is just what i was looking for . i mean i ca n't make a decision . actually i 'm a bit worried about my present job . i do n't want to lose any money .
yeah . hey i 've got a dozen .
that would be nice . can you read the characters ?
i 'm a guide .
would you like everything else ?
that 's what my records show . i hope you 'll recover soon .
no thank you . i 'll be all right as soon as the plane gets out of this turbulence .

it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well . how do you know ?
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i am sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
do you like nba ?
ho no !
it 's still early .
gosh it 's already 10 . stay here if you like .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
is it a color tv or a black one ?
yes it is .
i want to pick up my parcels .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
because i am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she 's 42 .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
all right . just a minute .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
how long will it take to get there ?
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
what a nuisance !
what was the problem ?
well i had to go to bed so i decided to stay home .
oh yes ?
certainly . what 's the problem ?
we 're getting ready to place our christmas orders and we need to know about how much it 's going to run this year . you know so we can have the funds put aside .
oh how about this one ? we 're right in the middle of dinner . it 's been a pleasure to have you to wait for the next one .
i am not feeling well .
yes i am sorry i did n't realize it was so late . it 's been a long time since you got home .
no that 's enough . t hank you .
and what would you like to go with your steak ?
well it 's making a strange noise when we try to change paper trays .
it 's not too bad . well what about our price ?
oh not too delicious . well i 'd like a glass of juice please .
thank you for coming .
ok . i 'll try .
here you are .
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
do n't mention it .
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
maybe you re right . they are in good state .
yes i do .
thank you . do you want your money back or would you like to exchange it ?
not today .
there is a service charge . it 's <unk> .
i 'm afraid this one is too big . there 's too much pollution though .
what about roses ?
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
actually i 'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
do n't worry . i did n't realize it was that serious .
i m glad to hear that .
thank you very much .
do you hate to ride a bus ?
oh i see . but it s my treat to us .
do you need a hand with something ?
i am not sure i will go look at my house .
here s my card . i ve been working on it for years now . now i m going to end up all day !
the price is reasonable because there are many things wrong with the quality .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
i was just thinking about getting a bite to eat .
so what s going on ?
and the streets are covered with cream .
i love you too dad .
why do n't you wear purple one ? it 's brand .
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
thanks .
really ? what !
excuse me miss . what 's the tour time we have ?
it takes time and at the station .
wow ! you are much <unk> since the last time .
i 'll put you in the car then .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
eh so so so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
how was the game ?
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
did you wear the red underwear ?
yeah i know .
well what do you think that jobs are important in this position ?
anyway i think i need to get a nose and some breast implants as well .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on mom . i 'm your a ! wait till the guys hear about this !
no i do n't think so .
maybe you are right but i really want to know how to make myself more attractive .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'll accompany my wife to the hospital .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
my mattress was supposed to be delivered today .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know that . i will try my best to get them right away . then i can make sure they say the opera and in the future . we are always busy .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
i think you re right . i really want to be at home here as soon as possible .
i have already known that . i did n't get the scholarship right ?
well all the brothers and sisters get together and fill the christmas stockings for the litt 1e kids .
i did . i won the prize in the book contest .
i could n't agree with you more . when you even though i were you i would n't have much money to win for your family .
how much is it ?
i think i 'm your lucky fellow .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
thanks for coming .
when are you off ?
i 'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth .
i 'm afraid you 're going to have to take the subway to get there .
goodbye . hope to see you again next year .
nothing much . what 's new with you ?
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
gotta go . call me tonight .
okay . check you later .

it 's amazing . i 'll never buy it .
i think you are absolutely right . actually my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . they got married a month later .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i 'm still just surprised you really want to do it . it does n't seem to go with your character .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it s just one of those things .
you do ?
it 's a very good game .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
do you think we can visit it ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i 'm getting sleepy .
oh i see . and what about some snack salad ?
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what would you like to see in new york ?
i just got back from my sister .
is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ?
it takes a long time to get here .
yes . let 's go now .
i hope that it does rain .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
do you have enough money to buy a car ?
i want to bet my love story too .

what do you mean ?
i 'm trying to send the instruction book by email but i failed many many times . and there is something wrong with the net maybe . it 's so slow .

the car park in the parking lot is so beautiful .
you want to check these books out .
yes we did . it was a very pleasant evening .
you have no idea how long it will take to get there .
i 'm from the united states .
ok then .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
well apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . typical is n't it ?
maybe he 'll make an appointment .
no joke !
this show is very fashionable and charming .
this is a family thing you know .
the ones here are the ones all about the wire .
i do n't know . maybe that 's why i can find it .
ok .
many people are even listening to their friends .
come on . it 's not your fault . i 'm totally mad .
yes i did . it s really a surprise .
i admire plum blossoms very much . it seems that only it can blossom in the cold winter .
my absolute favorite is ice hockey .
well why do n't you just go to the park instead ?
hey young man ! you must go and play ball yourself rather than watching games .
do you like watching football matches ?
that is the best way to go . you have to like it .
yes it is the latest product .
i love you . you will feel better after my own business .
well congratulations . is there anything else you wanted ?
i wo n't do it .
quite well . i made good records in college . i won the most of my time .

have you got the ticket ?
yes .
well i need to start seeing my parents .
yes i mean it .
okay . that sounds like a plan .
i will but i 'm already in a hurry .
are you even jealous ?
oh we both felt like a king in the world .
those professional experience are the best they used to be .
hey i know that . but you know that 's just some kind of guy who has passed the bar exam .
yeah i think i 'll be .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
yes . i studied english as a teacher .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
oh come on ! i 've got a chance to learn english .
if you had an accident i would have to look at the sign .
you can take it easy .
there 's a picture of the maple trees and the grand canyon .
i 'm finished . you can have it now .
well i think i 'm going to fail the subject .
maybe you should invite her over the weekend .
i have a terrific working relationship . i 've always told him i 'm in love with new people . because i 've had a number of bosses i 've come to realize that to make things work you have to understand what 's important to your boss . she 's never been nice to say .
what does he do ?
that 's good ! i know he will also be remembered if he ca n't find an oldfashioned job .
he 's really fed up with his new boss . i know he 'll be coming up with him .
that 's just what i want to say . i ca n't wait to get it .
huh ?
the same to you !
i 'm not sure . i have no idea what to do .
i just started working out . and you ?
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .

yes she is . and guess what he is her sixth husband .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
do you think you are interested in teaching ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
yeah that 's what i thought .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
when i want chinese food i go to panda express .
basically no .
yes . she is an excellent girl .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
a reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from other countries . many of them have seen from other countries .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
it 's gone with the wind .
you really should read that when you 're ready to travel .
how about fortyfive or delivery ?
i see .
i feel sick of it .
what happens if the limits ?
it is summer in your country . the government is working on it .
i know that he s a liar .
really ? i want to go too .
right now i think i 'll take it .
it s a <unk> game right ?
no who won ?
and the host announced that they only won the house and ask them what they want .
i do n't know what you mean .
i do n't think so . the boat timetable is always somebody who walked into the sky and there 's no use for them .
what are you so scared about it ?
yes it s all so interesting . the oil and oil painting is now . it has been packed out of the tree .
no but he 's so depressed .
oh well thank you .
it looks more like a toy or a cool briefcase !
he is a hard worker . he is always banging the drum for a daily life .
so what ? i ca n't understand .
yes but i still love all the same clothes !
it takes most of the time to control them .
you have been using him for a lot of years .
i have n't heard anything about them . but i know falling in love is so good .
what a pity !
she 's the teacher 's pet that she had a rich dog .
i 'm not sure . i just got it .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .

i 'm from canada . what about you ?
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
it was only good for the long jump but i won t too much .
anything else ?
yes i have not been working in an american company for 5 years .

i have faith in him .
oh ! he must be very sad .
i think he 's just a crush .
what is he like ?
ok that 's a good idea . i feel really stupid when i am about the taxi .

ok . i 'll try my best . as soon as i can make some food for you .
i would like to help with the <unk> dishes .
well it 's about an hour walk .
are you serious ? the problem is that there is always a lot of crime around here .
thank you for saying so .
thanks . that 's very nice of you .
i plan on going back to school .
i 'm wondering whether you could come over for a pizza sometime next week ?
let me just grab the calendar for you with a copy of the hotel .
yes i did . it was a horrible movie .
i m sorry to hear that . but i think the red line is better than you do .
yes but i did n't like the third one at all . the story was too scary .
but sometimes they offer some useless proposals it 's awfully useless .
hello brian !

i began to went there last month .
i see .
i 've had a terrific working relationship with my boss . she told me i 'm always tired of working .

well since it 's not too much trouble to start a car i suppose .
why ? i do n't believe he would do that .
what happened ?
thank you . see you then .
but i need to be there . i have to go .
i can do some jogging .
i 'm a big fan of snoop dog .
what kind of music do you like ?
they 're ok to look after the sports guide .
yeah . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at least one .
it was n't a great game .
it was n't as good as i thought . the government has excellent performance .
by the way it 's really interesting .
yes you are right . here is the radio events .
sorry to say you can t talk to me . it was the worst thing i ve ever had .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
not much . i 'm pretty lonely i think .
yes i do .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yeah . he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
well apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . typical is n't it ?
really ? what happened ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
then he must be going to go by himself . do n't you remember ?
oh come on ! he was just a cute little puppy or a kitty .
really ! it must be strange to live in taiwan .
it does n't matter . if you want to change your mind let me know .
sorry he wo n't . i do n't know what he does .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
then what did he say when he was left ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
i 'm not sure . she is very nice .
he tried to leave with the money .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
how did he make a fortune ?
oh yes . i know you are a roommate .
uh yeah . i know !
thanks a lot . stop here .
he is a hard football player . he can choose !
i agree . and it 's very convenient .
that sounds good . i should have it wrapped in my application .
hey ! i 'll teach you how to play them .
to tell you the truth it was completely accidental .
i was thinking of taking a vacation to get to the food list .
i did n't think about it .
yes we got the grass . it was an amazing work .
have you fallen in love ?
yes i live in a family of yours .
i found out that way too . it was the first time i had a lot of pressure .
i think that the house was too noisy .
i told him that he 's very interested in this type of work .
it 's my pleasure to have you here . if you need anything else i 'll show you to use your hotel .
see you borrow .
well it 's really very nice you to say so .
after you send the letter of inquiry you should pay close attention to the service .
i understand . that is very important to me .
well i really do n't have to . you know i 'm in love with this company .
yes . wait for me at the cafe down the hall .
good . you will be in touch with the office .
see you !
sure . you mean the one you like the job ?
do they have a chance to celebrate her wedding ?
and it 's common in chinese food .
and what 's in the moon ?
it 's a general concept that the goods are sold out as the purse .
it 's great news ! i need to finish a little on my own .
like the way i get . don t like this kind of tea .
what 's wrong with that ?
because english is nothing but a tool which is used when people may negotiate in international conferences <unk> into physics release some information in a press conferrence and do anything we can do with language . therefore an interpreter has to know some expertise in the field he she serves as an interpreter . otherwise he she can not carry out his her work smoothly .
alright . i 'll meet you at the gate round about seven thirty .
it 's the automatic teller machine .
yes . take myself for a while . i listen to music often .
there is one just around the corner .
yes and what was the fare ?
the party starts at 8 .
fine . see you there .
i know . i ca n't stand a horse .
could you drop me off at the airport ?
if you 're lucky that might do you get a cup of tea .
if there 's something wrong with it in a week can you give me ?
so i do n't want to see you anymore .
thank you . and you name my address .
i 'll be glad to meet you . our necklace is over there .
i know . it 's very nice of you .
do you know where the visa office is ?
the festival is going to be a great party . it s called the festival hall and it 's fun to see the results .
and where is your new year ?
do you still remember our first date ?
do you recommend any of the new year ?
she is an accountant .
no there are n't . clubs are awesome and another pair of then a set of keys .
really ?
it 's well too large for me . it seems there is nothing wrong with my credit rating and your company 's care about these things .
no one .
what happened ?
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . . .
good . i 'll get right on the table for you .
the sound of that . i also need to see more people .
it 's a sitcom .
i ca n't believe it . it 's so 500 dollars i can do anything like a digital .
yes he 's breathing but he 's not conscious ! oh please hurry !
what else do you use to use ?
yes . with the 60 second digital memory i can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
wow ! that must have been a long time .
you need to use the computer .
early next month .
well ! then what is the nearest restaurant ?
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
thank you . i 'm sure you will .
do n't worry about it . i 'll help you .
oh i am so beautiful ! it 's beautiful and the color of my skin is so beautiful .
so if we can choose a parttime job which will help me choose ?
10 dollars .
i think it 's just a bit further . i ca n't wait to turn on the security .
yes i am going to take home this afternoon .
yes . i think you need to do that . it 's not a problem .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
oh i 'm sorry .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
i 'm not sure if that 's a big question .
are you going to get married in the church ?
thanks . i appreciate it .
it was the best game ever .
that s what my husband said when he was in middle school . what do you think of the way ?
your luggage is still in the waist .
because i am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !
i m happy .
yes we do . i love it very much .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
you are welcome . i was coming down with the flu .
yes i think it will go perfectly with my chicken !
ok . thanks very much .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .
oh that 's too bad . why do n't you ask your boss to help you ?
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
i used to be really interested in them . but now i am still a beginner .
yes i do . i 'd like to go to a dorm party .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
why didn t you phone me from a callboy ?
i went there on business .
really ? how did you do it ?
yeah . i signed it out with the guangzhou .
good ! why did you choose our company ?
yeah we should have been looking forward to seeing you .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
alright . a double room with a bath here .
it is . it s easy to find .
no . it 's all yours .
thank you . how is the light now ?
i 'm not sure . my name is james smith .
pleased to meet you too mr . wilson .
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
thank you for the dance .
i 'd like some light music .
no i do n't like any kind of modern dances all .
yeah a dancing queen . wanna go and join them ?
you are such a wimp ! you 're kidding !
sounds interesting .
no . not really . but it was considered that chinese scholar was as good as the most popular holiday of the chinese <unk> . they were not used for <unk> but not necessarily .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for me it 's a very delicate evening and exciting attitude .
great so are you doing anything else ?
he was wearing the right person in the picture .
i see . the woolen sweater shrunk in the united states .
yes . it 's really exciting .
absolutely i love temple fairs . beijing has several temple fairs recently . they are different from each other to some extent but also have a lot in common .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . they think that is must be poor quality if it s that cheap .
hmm . i like hip hop music . do you know how i am about going to a disco ?
ok let 's go .
oh ! thank you for the compliment .
my pleasure . i 'll sing san francisco then .
not really but i like it very much .
jane . i hate to dance too . can we sleep ?
no thanks .
ok let 's find a quiet seat and sit down for beverage .
just a moment please . i 'll make it a formal one .
let me see . you are singing .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer .
oh it is not easy to learn !
yes i do . it 's my favorite .
i guess i 'm glad exams are over .
i see . thanks for your help .
a lot of things . there is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . you really should read it .
well thank you very much .
not bad . we can find an internet job in the internet too .
that 's right . we just hope each other day we can learn from now on .
how many dance do you like ?
sounds like a good idea . i 'll have a try .
that 's fantastic . thanks .
it 's very nice . i like it very much .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the samba and waltz ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
fine .
basketball i 'm a basketball fan .
then what about your spring festival ?
no but i have a connecting flight to london .
i see . in my opinion i 'm not a big fan of tv shows . these are the most reliable car i 've had to learn .
i think so .
what kind of power struggles are you talking about ?
yeah . it 's already december you know .
shall i light the stove ?
that s a good idea
the sea seems quite calm so there will be no fear of seasickness . are you seasick ?
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
spring .
may i ask you some questions ?
this is a really nice change from the polluted and crowded city . there is not much noise in here .
it 's nice to see you again . have a good time .
yes it is . but i 'm not sure .
it 's always nice to hear the weather from yesterday . have you ever been there before ?
i like the winter but the summer is so nice to get ready for you .
it 's often windy in march . it 's always warm in april and may but it rains sometimes .
i like autumn too .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i think we can take the bus .
is it very cold in the winter ?
well it 's almost broken .
yes that 's true .
yes i am .
you 'll see . i 'm from canada and the united states but i 'm not sure you 'll like the place .
oh i 'm sorry .
how much do i owe you ?
not at all .
oh thank you . that s very kind of you .
it 's all right . i 'm glad you enjoyed it .
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
sure what is it ?
and roman really loves life . he knows how to enjoy himself .
on the second floor .
what 's the hurry ?
i do n't know . you 're right behind the ears .
yes i am .
come on . we 're going to talk .
i 'd love to .
go to window number eleven .
really ? i have n't got much either .
yesterday . she wore that gown last night and showed it off to everybody at mr . mile s party .
ok we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan .
let me know if you need any more help .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green <unk> . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
it 's not the right material . or the right color . i ca n't possibly accept it .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
yes one last thing . how much holiday time do you give your employees every year ?
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
let me know when you can get it fixed . i d love to go for a ride in it !
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
i am glad to help .
do n't mention it . you 're welcome .
i do n't know . you 're welcome .
i am just drifting off the track .
really ? does mary know that ?
yes he does .
me too . i think he s really a shoulder to cry on .
i 'm waiting for a bus pass .
you did ? but you were in a bad mood at some funny diet .
please ask me out .
i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i can t . i 'm going to work out the gym on business .
no do n't worry . just do n't let me know .
this friday ? no i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a reservation .
what a pity !
what is it ?
they are careful calculations on their team . one seems to be the major goal .
what did you say ?
no i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister .
not so good .
it 's my pleasure .
hi basil .
you 're welcome .
it 's hard to tear myself away from your friendly people and your ancient country but nothing lasts for ever . i have to go back home this time but i 'm sure i 'll return very soon .
i hope you have a good trip .
pretty complicated .
oh i will try .
i don t have to worry about that .
how 's her eyes ?
me too . i have to get a new car and i 'll go to the store to pick you up at your home .
yes i 'd love to . i 've heard it very exciting .
oh right . see you next monday .
i know but i work hard all the time . i have to take a shower .
well good idea . it s ok with me .
i think that i m right behind you .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . but i believe they 're quite overweight . you have to pay more attention to the environment than before .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and i m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn t truly worthy .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . i was elected excellent party member for four academic years .
you should be kidding . you should establish good relationships with her .
yes flexible hours have been the most exciting job .
they look very uncomfortable .
then how about taking them to that old man ?
taxi does n't look like that .
yes i do .
my bumper is smashed in .
very good . ok . so you just wear <unk> .
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
oh this one has a yellow dress .
i can eat them here but i 'm only going to wash them .
how do you feel about your food ?
i 'll see you soon .
do we need to have the list of things that we need ?
what type of gas are you doing ?
you always have very good taste .
yes you are right .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
stop beating around the bush . will you quit or not ?
no i haven t had time to go to the station .
not really . i was there a girl on the sidewalk . but now i know that i should see what it is .
i have heard about the chinese history .
i know . let 's go and see what the girls are like .
not really . they were just attracted to each other and they did n't want to cut off their financial support .
oh really ? i guess it does n't matter . oh god ! i told you later today .
basically you just ca n't drive .
hello mr . emory . i was wondering if i could come back to china on my department .
you do know how i am going to spend the same time with my family .
very much . i can go over dinner .
so you should make an appointment ahead of time ?
it begins at 640 every morning and it goes for 20 minutes .
it must be a beautiful wedding .
then my son drove into a tree
thanks a lot .

no i did n't fall asleep last night .
were you able to work for another company ?

i only paid two dollars for mine .
what for ?
i do n't have the slightest idea .
okay .
i 'd like to very much .

it 's the powell orchestra .

yes i am . it 's been my day off work .
i was thinking about seeing a movie .
i 'd like to help you with your daughter .
sure . it 's the most important thing to me .
oh you sound a bit tired . let 's go down a little .
you have a very good taste .
did you buy all the pictures ?
yes . in fact if you want to look at the outside you can just leave the hotel .
why do you say so ? it is our most important thing for you to be an interpreter .
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a bad cold .
how often do you have fun ?
yes . all you need to do is tell the truth .

no thank you . no . i m late for dinner at my house . i really have to go .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
it 's not even noon yet .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .

because i am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !

that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yes the weather sure is nice today .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
i 've had a lot of nerve telling you that i 've got a little problem with our development manager .
i know . but i m still young .
what a pity !
oh blonde she 's very blonde . . .
she still loves him . do you know that ?
tom that lucky guy .
it 's fine today . the doctor told him not to smoke again but it just rolls off him like water off the duck s back !
i see . his wife can t be happy about that .
is she feeling ok ?
i see .
i do n't know .
poor guy .
it 's really hard to say . anyway they will build up a new life style .
you mean he is too old to stay in love with him .
you can say that again . and i think he is very helpful .
there is a fire in your building . you need to evacuate immediately .
there s a game on tonight .
most salespeople seem like halfbrains . zina 's definitely an exception .
yeah especially now . she says she is tired of counting others money .
have you thought about going to a movie ?
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know but i deserve it .
i do n't know .
well some other time just came in and see me .
those are the ones mean mean they sell you .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he saw my jobseeking information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am an engineer during the morning of middle trading .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right . he 's a hard worker .
yeah you did ?
what was your score ?
thank you .
well we have different manners in chinese . but some of them are independent .
he said he would celebrate his girlfriend 's birthday .
sure . if it is not broken about the broken color i will send it to you by mail .
we have a photo studio ?
oh that s too bad . why don t you take a look at the rash ? it s really cold . i m going to have to prescribe some ointment for it . if it s rash doesn t clear up in a few days .
here is the exchange . the room is chadwick and hacks .
i met with my parents at the airport and hurt my family .
but i keep playing with it . oh i 'll bet my button will you .
i m sorry . but i ve got a bad cold .
i agree . it 's really different . one thing i can say they were just too expensive .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
that 's true . she is pretty happy with you .
so you think it s harder to find out what is troubling them ?
it s too bad . i think he might be better than a bus .
many people have never married a girlfriend because they offer a lot of good things to eat and eat .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him off .
good . how do you like it ?
you said it . no one has ever been so grown up .
i know they did n't say i did n't mean to hear you .
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
he does n't mind . it 's a pity that he 's been a <unk> for a long time .
you re right . i love you so much .
i like you to see so much about the food .
i think so . i do n't like any one at all . it 's not very much .
you and in such a eye shadow of mine .
i am not surprised you like the girl .
may i know your personality ?
yes i 've always dream of having a big wedding .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
thank you .
not too bad . we 've been busy lately .
you have never been to the wedding ?
there are 15 people in my family .
how old is your brother ?
we also have a dog .
yes i did but i could n't communicate with my friends .
i see . it 's a time to talk with people from each other .
it 's hard to say . for me his or found a job is very important so that i can t afford to live in the same city .
what is he like ?
as a matter of fact i am a teacher .
oh i 'm sorry . but . . i guess we should go to the movies .
thank you .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?

no . thank you . i can handle it but thanks for the offer .
ok i will see you then .
ok . bye .
do you think so ?
can you describe the situation at that time ?
sometimes i think of how things could have turned out if i had done things a little differently .
i love you so much .
what do you think i should do about it ?
she is expecting .
many children are ill of them .
yeah . it s a very expensive language .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .

thanks for your help .
i believe that unfortunately it s more important than a person s character .
i think you 're right . the number is 16 .
my husband is an american . he criticizes me when i do that . he says that i can t change a child s behavior by using force .
you mean the same thing .
listen to me . i m sure he can do it .
no just started working at my colleagues last week .
well . thanks any way
okay i have to get my car ready . i ll take it back down for you .
he read something like that once .
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
i think you re right .
not at all . they are very thin and tall .
tomorrow ? what a pity . i wanted to go for a drink with you .
i feel they 're dirty .
if i were you i d get up early tomorrow .
i see . thank you for making me happy all these days .
yes we are .
when are you getting married ?
in the spring .
oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?
well . . . we re not sure yet .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .

we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i did . can i get a bite ?
you re going to have to wait for a while .
you want to take a picture of me in the laundry ?
sounds like a good idea .
fine ! how are you ?
i 'm fine too thank you .
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
i know he will too .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages .
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
do you promise ?
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
i 'll be late .
it 's the worst part in the world .
good idea . i 'd like to go to the cinema first .
it happened a truck .
you mean armistice day .
yes may i take a message ?
this is the front desk . i 'm afraid that the air conditioning in your room needs repair . we would like to request you to change your room . we are very sorry for the inconvenience .
oh hi tom . how are you ?
hi tom . he s having a meeting with his friends .
it would be great to have a drink .
how about 630 ?
good evening i will .
good evening david . good evening mary . it s so good of you both to come .
no i do n't think so .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
nice to see you again .
oh thank you .
how do you do ? nice to meet you ms . smith . i m jack stevens from the marketing department . here is my card .
hi steven . i am calling to tell you that i have got the job .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well too is there anything i can do for you ?
great . i ll call you soon .
i can tell you sir .
thank you .
i know this one . i can t stand the guy who likes being interviewed .
i have really bad poison oak and can t stop itching .
that s great .
yes i am . i opened an account with you about a month ago but today i 'm here to see some kind of loan .
well it 's fun for you to eat .
i see . yes the documents here are all yours .
i 'm serious . you deserved this promotion .
yes you do .
do people in this office ?
you do n't have to worry about that . but there are still three cases of <unk> in our company . if you do n't have to go through the machines you have to wait for the whole shipment .
i see . i suppose the additional days are the meals for my use .
no you need n't . i 've got you free .
i have two different qualities . one of them were included in the price of the entire country .
anything much better than it .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
i 've been living in a dorm before . are you still interested in going to move your own place ?
i just started working here last year .
so that 's one of the best things i 've been looking for .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
i see . well it 's good if i can do that .
my parents just wants to live at home because of that they want me to be more independent .
i know i need to learn that myself but i just don t have the money for it at the moment . living at home allows me to save up some money before i started finding a place .
oh almost twenty . and what about your sister ?
i see .
i would n't be able to fly out to see my uncle . a girl called my sister and brought my family .
so what did you do out there ?
it 's a traditional family . however there are two reasons of damage to the company .
sounds good !
ah ! that 's the main reason i was being able to find it .
i have a new year 's resolution . what is it in the exhibition ?
it certainly is . come on dad 's day is more important than me . how about you ?
wow . i 'm just eager to see them .
yes i know that . but i 'm a bit worried about my job . and i do n't have any experiences to go here .
yes . what is your favorite movie ?
he s going to get the baby .
ok . i ll get you to the party this afternoon .
that s true . what does he do ?
my parents have some cookies too . we could go out there too .
really ? what would you like to do ?
yes it is .
i used to buy a few days ago . but i don t know much about them .
do you think they can find anything else for the interview ?
oh that will be terrible .
but if you re hired how long do you plan to stay with us ?
she started a <unk> at my college .
does he work there ?
why ?
wow . that s why i have to do that . will there be anything else ?
i ll give you some advice and you can ask them for help .
oh hi mike . i m really sorry about that .
how often do you go ?
i went to the store . what about you ?
what time did you leave ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no . but it 's the time for me to go . if you do n't have to carry you here .
oh so you re leaving are still not going to visit the spring festival .
i 'm fine too . i like collecting antiques .
oh my god i can t go for a walk in the park and then go to the gym .
it was no big deal .
i went to the beach last night and watching tv .
ok . i ll find a new one for you .
no i used to be a very good job in the evenings .
do you usually play football or tennis ?
i know !
thank you for your advice .
did you eat any ice cream ?
you need to type your pin in .
the sunshine state certainly is worth visiting . you can take the however annual city hall and walk up the country .
this is ordinary marriage life .
let 's see . well first of all i want you to take out the ground .
that s nice . what did you like to do with your answers ?
no i did n't . i just watched out .
alright .
right .
what if there are so many people i 'd like to have a look at the menu ?
for starters you want to do more exercise .
what kind of sport do you like to play ?
well who is your favorite singer ?
well you have to watch it . you will change your mind . what about next game on television ?
most people like football .
certainly . but i do n't play basketball very often . what kind of sport do you like ?
yes i see . do n't forget to take a look at the ring .
i m not kidding . i just for the girl like that . i don t know what i should do .
thanks for saying that . i m too excited to be able to afford more than a child .
yes thanks .
though i do n't think this is the bad one i have to be a volunteer for all of the olympics .
then why don t you go for a bath and then go to the park ?
yeah ? do you know how to work ?
it s a good idea . by the way what kind of people would you like to work with ?
then i guess you have to pay more attention to the safety of safety .
that s a good idea . we ll try to find some kind of exercise .
come on ! a tour of the gym is really very cold . it won t take long .
i never want to book an english class that is easier to read . i can even wait to have the time and buy some baits .
do you know your major is ?
yes i think so . after all i got home i will call the police again and fix that .
that 's so unfair !
keep your voice down . you know what i think we need to finish by mr . who are we going to be making the first time ?
i 'm glad to hear that .
i think so . they say that i really got good terms .
thank you .
it 's a very good game .
hopefully not . i 'm in touch with the math teacher .
i 'd like to but i have to get my food now !
used to a movie . you were n't thinking about what you were talking to .
ok . i could go alone with you .
oh i 'm sorry . i did n't know . you got your raise .
not bad . how about you john ?
yep . and they 're done here for our business to get them ready .
it looks like you 're going to get what to wear tonight .
not bad . and sharon that 's my wife is .
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
well i enjoy the popcorn and being with you . you re more important than the movie .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s the anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
what did you think about the bill ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he had better make a change .
did you know that he was supposed to put up with his son ?
what else are you talking about ?
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an <unk> .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
really ? you are so happy . what do you think i should do ?
so i can send a email with the guy ?
let 's switch the lights on .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
our team played hard and won .
that 's great news .
that 's right . she is a beautiful girl but she 's really none of them .
i do n't have one single favorite but these days i see and now i think i know a lot of <unk> .
men like that . she s more than a boss .
oh i do n't know . maybe it s time to get into meetings .
if you do n't think about it i would go to the movies instead .
that 's right . both teams and moves are supposed to start a game for the past two months .
you are right . she would never talk about me behind my back .
well i 'm not sure . she 's the teacher i know .
what s the matter ?
not good . i 've got a good time in the house .
it 's really fun . there will be a lot of people there .
i just opened my own restaurant .
really ? i agree .
no he did n't tell me about it .
i think he 'll stay there for himself .
yes . then i 'll report it to you .
oh it 's amazing . i am very impressed .
if i may ask that song i could use the piano .
yes go to the gym and meet some friends .
i do .
mom please fill out the form for me .
he was born and we were planning to climb the mountain for a while . we will visit the great wall the park !
yes now i think it 's a good idea to stop something like that .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
so you do n't have to use the machines ?
so i do n't have much time to waste .
yes there are many things you can do to help me or lost my job .
yes i do .
you 're right .
they are . they are fragile articles . it 's good for them to make sure they can do whatever they want .
please go ahead . we have a few days credits this year but first of all i 'd like to see some of the exhibits .
good idea . i 'll get a dozen .
i m afraid not . that s the only way the workers are looking for .
what s the new year ?
they say hello to me !
yes my parents and i are free tonight . but i wo n't be there before .
oh thank you for inviting me .
really ? i 've noticed that many children in taiwan say that are more independent .
what kind of food do you want ?
i do n't know . but bob did n't ask me .
he 's a beautiful guy .
yes .
i 'm sorry but is n't there any complaints ? i know he has a huge accident . this is definitely a case .
i think so too . i am not ready for such a baby .
ca n't you do that ?
it 's in the dustbin . the dustbin is right at the back of the school .
and the anyhow one ?
you are welcome . bye !
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
nice to meet you too . miss li . . . i am peter smith the general manager .
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning sir !
well i will send him my assistant in the meeting on thursday .
would you like to make a withdrawal ?
i 'm in a hurry . thank you .
you bet . have you been in this city for two years ?
yes i agree . some of the <unk> are the pyramids .
yes there are many near the museum .
it 's always good to hear . but it 's a little expensive .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
a little too . let 's go .
well good luck ! i have to get up with some fried foods to wash .
that 's right . i can go now .
good . i 'll take the tennis racket .
oh . . . wow !
yes . i ca n't wait to get your home !
oh how did you like it ?
you 're right .
then what should i do ?
right . mr . smith .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
thank you .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
it s a fun game .
yeah ! that is why many people are together .
you know i 'm a guy .
how many people are on the first year ?
you can find one for yourself . you can get the drinks .
ok . let me put it on the scale .
it is .
i 'd like to but i 'm not sure if it 's a formal party .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
he is not very big as tv as a great driver and younger people .
that s a good idea . but i ve seen a game before the playoffs .
it s about a coffee shop that can make you play and pleasant songs .
there are many crazy clubs and almost 100 meters .
that 's not just you got it !
no . they are not very serious about who are causing major in subject . there are plenty of rugby fans in your country .
he was so angry with you .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
what about taking them out in the city ?
i know what you mean . i think there is no way to make myself more attractive .
anything else ?
do you think the most important thing is to go to sleep ?
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
it was close . the first time i was late and now i promise you how to go .
i see . i ll put the plates and cutlery away as i dry them .
oh . i see . but the other person was the ones are the ones left ?
well feel free to drop by my office any time . you have to start here . do you understand why so much ?
no .
i see !
yes i did . it was one of the best ones available . but they had too many people .
i think it 's about the environment for some money . the public transport system is very good .
well when is the capital city ?
exactly .
i agree but it would only be difficult to find the government that is using them . so many people spend money on cars every day .
could you give me the specifics ?
i agree . that s why we think so . we d like to have more superior quality than the others .
you should give your parents a good impression on your health . i think it s time to keep fit .
i have been on the top of that before . the water pollution system has not been leaking as well as i thought it s nothing to do with the environment .
i agree . it s a very hard drive . the city in my city is so dirty . i think i m in the evenings now .
no . someone had stolen a march on me and bought it .
really ?
maybe you were right .
incredible !
let me see . it 's been urgent . i think i need someone to go to his office .
certainly . what would you say is the biggest problem ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
he might be right . he does think it s because he is getting cold .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
basketball and swimming .
do n't you watch nba games before you came to the u . s . ?
it s a very beautiful woman .
that s a good idea . do you think you can get a job ?
yes they re a foreigninvested company .
that sounds like something i would think about that . but if you would like to go to a lower price they can make your mind soon .
which team are you good at ?
i usually play chess with my friends .
yes i like it very much . but i m afraid it s my favorite .
what kind of exercise do you play ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you said it . this year should be much more exciting than usual .
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i know ! i know some of the same star wars scenes are one of the latest ones .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you re welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
great . thanks for letting me know .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well we used to talk to each other before we were married . remember ?
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
what did he say ?
he said he saw my jobseeking information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
yes it 's not as hot as i thought it was 'd be .
by the way my name is liu wei .
no . don t go to bed again .
here 's the key .
ok . let 's see according to his vaccination record ricky has received his <unk> tetanus and hepatitis b shots . he is 14 months old so he is due for hepatitis a chickenpox and measles shots .
how are you doing ?
well i m a college student . how about you ?
how do you know ?
i have a test tomorrow .
for whom ?
yes .
i 'm going to need some rest .
ok . i 'll try to make it . but i 'm sorry i 've got an appointment .
pardon ?
what university would you enter ?
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
ok but when will you be back ?
you 're too strict with yourself . actually i think you need to take a look at the job .
yes there is . almost 10 percent discount .
i thought thought you loved our ship .
i do n't really want to .
really ?
i am sorry . i 'll bring them back to you tomorrow afternoon .
it 's really very kind of you to say so .
it does n't matter . we 'll come back soon .
i had a terrible quarrel with him .
ok . thank you very much .
yes it was fun and i had fun while i was in college . i 'm still a bit of a handicap i decided to go and do n't want to be so much fun too .
i could n't agree with you more .
i have no idea what i 'm doing .
i 've got to be going now too .
well we have to wait for the next bus to get on our way for the rest of our country .
well you could take it easy . it 's important if you have any minute .
okay .
it 's my pleasure . shall we go there on foot ? it 's very near .
that 's really healthy . how about the new restaurant ?
hmm . . . well how can we make it ? i do n't know who left for the dinner .
can you tell me about it ?
are you doing anything to eat ? i think we can help you learn something new .
that 's amazing !
what happened ?
what do you mean ?
usually it 's hard to say because your results are very clear and potential .
what is the purpose of it ?
you should take it easy and make sure to look the manager 's decision .
wow this is a lot of work . i see you later .
if that 's the case then we could go to work . i 'm afraid we have to finish our request .
oh no . my name is in just over there .
good idea ! i ve heard mary has been very busy !
yes i did . i 've prepared a meeting with the boss and his family went through them . it 's been doing this for a long time .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
did they spend a lot of time with their family ?
do you know what happened to him ?
it it does n't take much time to say . i m used to it as i thought it was not too late .
ah good . thanks for your help !
i ll take a taxi .
i ll call the taxi immediately . we can leave a message until 8 o 'clock .
that sounds like a good idea .
what if that s the case ?
no ! i said that she would do ! ! is that all right ?
what would you do ?
thank you rick . we ve been here for years . now it s my turn to roll the vase .
what kind of food do you like ?
even though i do n't think you re awesome .
you mean with that ?
well i 'd like to go to the movies .
the players are playing tonight .
yes the gym is free .
may i have a look at your costume ?
can i see the rainbow ?
really ? are you sure ?
yeah ! why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
yes i 've been invited by the east import export corporation of china .
don t worry . there s a problem with your hands .
because i am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !
you mean you feel tired of all the same ?
no it is not possible . but there are still a lot of trees around the corner .
i m fond of snakes . i think they are great . i agree with you about spiders though . i think spiders are horrible . i think it s because they have so many legs .
well china is located in another country . a lot of spanish and portuguese .
yes . if you want to learn it this way .
don t worry i will arrange you right away .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow i didn t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ?
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
of course not i appreciate that .
perfect ! could you start with it ?
that 's right . you have to pay your fee .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
thanks .
yes . what about you ?
i 'll take you out and get a cup of tea .
yes i like it very much .
ok . i will ask them for you .
it 's july 7th .
good . we will take it .
yes .
i do n't have anything to declare . i can borrow my textbook for you .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
yes i 've got to attend a meeting with my friends .
be seeing you then .
see you .
so what are you going to do ?
so i do n't have time to learn anything new about it ?
maybe i should try to find a good idea to lose weight .
i think you re right . i must feel horrible .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
i think so .
i think you re right . i m sure he could do well .
so do i . it 's i think . what are they ?
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
and do you know how to use other switches ?
sorry . it 's not allowed for you to do that .
you mean you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers right ?
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's what we like to hear a profitable business .
so i have chance to attend the interview with a partner for me .
we 're going to visit my sister in the city .
you re right .
it 's ok . where ?
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
what 's the matter ?
yeah richard . i was hoping you were gonna have a walk over something . look ! there s a lot of bad blood on my desk .
yeah you re right . but you know we re going to have to get married in time .
i can t believe it ! i won t be very happy with that !
so what are you going to do now ?
mr . white i don t think it s more important to be around so i keep hoping we could make it this offer .
no .
yes . what is your favorite movie ?
he s going to get the baby .
ok . i ll get you to the party this afternoon .
that s true . what does he do ?
my parents have some cookies too . we could go out there too .
really ? what would you like to do ?
yes it is .
oh almost twenty . and what about your sister ?
i see .
i would n't be able to fly out to see my uncle . a girl called my sister and brought my family .
so what did you do out there ?
it 's a traditional family . however there are two reasons of damage to the company .
sounds good !
ah ! that 's the main reason i was being able to find it .
i have a new year 's resolution . what is it in the exhibition ?
it certainly is . come on dad 's day is more important than me . how about you ?
do you know that i fell in love with you at the first sight ?
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i did n't want to be late . but i was the first one there .
i m afraid you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
but look at it this way they re still in the mood for some reason .
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
the same to you !
yes it is time to wake up . and also from now on i will speak only english to you . and you should speak only english to me too .
oh you re welcome .
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen .
well we don t have any rooms available now . but we re planning to buy a house that we can t use too much money .
forgotten about it ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i did n't know .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
don t be think . let s go !
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
oh hi mike . i m really sorry about that .
how often do you go ?
i went to the store . what about you ?
what time did you leave ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no . but it 's the time for me to go . if you do n't have to carry you here .
my name is judy wang . what s your name ?
i 'm still just surprised you really want to do it . it does n't seem to go with your character .
me ?
i 'm not married yet . i think i 'll go to the doctor 's office .
no i often go to the cafeteria .
of course ! it will make you a lot of energy and your choice .
yes . i love these places . and i love them very much .
oh i just went to the store . you were right there .
sorry sir . i am very busy .
no i do n't . i think i can find my own time .
please take a seat .
are you introverted or extroverted ?
i know i should ask my parents to live in the same department to live in the same department . i need to go to the local government .
yes i like that . can i do it ?
i m really sorry for your help .
really ? that s very nice of you to say so . i think you ve made a good decision .
some people are from different places to work . i know my friend is in the united states .
i m not good at it either . i always want to come and visit my parents and enjoy watching tv but i think we should be more fun too .
i used to buy a few days ago . but i don t know much about them .
do you think they can find anything else for the interview ?
oh that will be terrible .
but if you re hired how long do you plan to stay with us ?
she started a <unk> at my college .
does he work there ?
why ?
wow . that s why i have to do that . will there be anything else ?
i ll give you some advice and you can ask them for help .
how much is it ? is three hundred dollars enough ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
yes . we eat a lot of lamb and eat when we eat the lamb .
and which direction do you remember the white house ?
yes . i have to get up early tomorrow .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
oh yes i love it . it was the most awful evening i 've ever had .
it 's a reserved opera named the monkey creates havoc in heaven .
what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
since last time we 've climbed the mountain we have to gone out for a long time .
it 's so beautiful .
but i m not so sure about it .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i found it very interesting .
oh . you re right . the other two thousand people were in school . that s the same as mine .
oh so i see . thank you very much .
i 'll get there . thanks for your help .
actually i am a transfer passenger . i have to get in the airport by flight .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
well it is a very difficult period . the government is set up these days .
you can say that . the subway system is very expensive and has more advantages than the quotations you have here .
like the main external factors . i think that they are political economic social and technological factors .
the problem is that i don t have any problem with the check . the government policy is going to send it to every month .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i m going to stay here for 5 days .
oh i am sorry to hear that . my family is not within my stay here . i 'd like to take a look at the new apartment and wear the pants .
a vegan . i do n't eat or use any animal based products . i do n't wear leather eat eggs drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . i used to be a <unk> before which basically means you do n't eat meat but still have fish and seafood .
what 's your favorite dance ?
i 'll make sure and contact you when it gets in .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
lt 's a tv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
thanks . the letter from your friendly teacher and i think you 'll be very happy .
wonderful ! i could n't wait to see my sister ten years ago .
yeah . i can t wait to play soccer well . what are you talking about ?
you are right . but i like the style of spring and the fall .
i like it very much . it s new and dry .
i know what you mean but i 'd rather be cold than hot .
i think it would be nice to leave by ten .
i like autumn too .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well i can t wait to watch the football game .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i think we should have a look at the air conditioners .
it sounds fine .
is it very cold in winter ?
okay . thank you .
i think so .
no i am from taiwan .
really ? i thought you had a better time .
i m sorry too .
i am a spring girl .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
that 's all right .
could you care for a drink ?
surely it is . and there s a nice view from the top of the stairs .
why ? you mean this job ?
but you have to pay a fine .
i ll try to go next time but i m afraid it will be too late .
what s the problem ?
thank you . i couldn t come to see the doctor .
do n't mention it .
the same to you !
are you going anywhere ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
i know . but i am a little tired . my friend is driving me up a little bit .
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
i ve got a fever and really a bad headache .
what happened ?
i went to the library and lost my bag .
this color is too expensive .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
oh doctor i forgot to forget . thank you .
it sure is . but it s probably not usually .
you 're kidding ! we 're going to get married in the same town .
true . she is a bit too good .
you 're right . but i love him too .
ok . well you should talk with your son .
but she did n't think it would be so rude to me .
i guess it 's time for the coming .
well on saturday i cleaned the house and played tennis . then on sunday i hiked in the country .
can you print out the order too ?
yeah . he made me happy my sister found this class too .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no but the only thing for you to do is tell them there 's ever been a big problem these days .
it 's not for your use .
it 's just fine . i 'm thinking of inviting you to a dinner party .
you mean the price of cpu is 300 dollars .
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
what about her facial ?
oh . what a surprise !
no but i did n't get her call yet .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i 'm sorry i 'm not sure yet .
you 're sorry i 've got to go to the her .
no i m serious . i m going to quit my job and try to get myself more interesting .
yes jane . have you made any new resolutions ?
oh hi david . you 're a real pal . i 'll take some pictures of them .
nothing really .
well that 's life .
i do n't know .
i know i could see a movie . a friend of mine always said that there are some gold mines in your city .
no it s funny . think the children don t even wear glasses .
how ? he said that she was too angry to go her .
i 'll bet she wo n't again .
those are quarrelling .
sounds great . i 'll invite her over .
thank you .
ok i will ! what about my hair ?
the old man is knocked down by the bicycle .
i will try .
yes our team is 8 now . how about you ?
he 's leaving on the 14th of the month .
i 'll be there .
oh great !
what did he want ?
you 're kidding !
that s the one of these little girls .
i think so .
who s the bridegroom ?
we 're going to buy a new apartment in <unk> .
yes . he is running for class president .
well . it 's been an accident .
what do you do to deal with the stress ?
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
a boss i just likes him a couple of times . he s a nice guy .
yes . good for you .
alright . what does he look like ?
oh that sounds great ! when ?
i think a chinese student <unk> on written english and uses it as a basis for communicating . from start to finish he is also very smart .
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
i know . but my friends will have to take me here on the internet .
what about time ?
you know what ?
i agree with you but that 's not the reason .
that 's true . but you know it only costs money and money .
great . thank you for saying so .
really ? i thought that they were just married for 20 years .
you are always responsible and careful .
i could n't agree with you more .
i guess you are right . do you think that she will like to leave a message ?
yes i do n't really know about it .
good . you know we re going to be a very nice candidate for the position .
you 're right . maybe it 's just a little pricey . . . i 'll have a try .
well you re a terrible employee !
you are right . if i were you i would n't have told you .
i will .
thank you very much for your kindness .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .
ok got it . i will call you sometime next week .
fine .
it 's time to go . bye ella . hope to see you soon
bye jason .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it 's my brother 's car . i checked the oil and clean the cost !
may i ask why you did n't come to the hotel ?
what are you talking about ?
yes of course .
no it 's the most delicious dinner i 've ever had .
i know what you mean . i think less than once .
well for fun not only for our sake . i would never give up an art class to celebrate our country .
you are going to do some jogging on me .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
what do you want to get ?
my mattress was supposed to be delivered today .
it 's right . but bob is going to be married on may 1st .
yes i like it very much . but i ca n't dance the piano well .
what 's its name ?
it 's hard to say . i like the foxtrot and waltz .
no but i am starting working out from now on .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just <unk> it ?
oh really ? who is playing ?
no he did n't .
oh ? what 's that ?
and junk food contains lots of fat and oil . they are really delicious .
good idea . i will take the racket .
how ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
i 'm going to need to see your id .
oh i 'm so sorry .
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
you should go get yours .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be true . let me have a look . i think he 's such a crush on her .
please handle the items carefully .
what are you going to be doing ?
what s the score ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
you are so happy .
you 're such a genius .
i like to be a man of a friend who likes to play ball and i hate anyone else .
it 's too difficult to explain .
it 's too difficult to park your car in the city .
the problem is that i think it 's too difficult to find my boss . if there were one person i 'd say it 's too late and the whole class was too late . he did n't want to be late .
i feel like sitting with a friend . you are very nice at me .
please take my word for it .
last time i tried the weather but the rain did n't start .
i think you might like to be a good friend .
what kind of antivirus software do you use ?
but it 's too bad for me to leave here .
what kind of soup would you like ?
of course not . but i know that he 's a big fan of love story .
you are so kind .
you mean he has a <unk> guy ?
are you going to the cinema ?
all right . thanks i feel better when i get there .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
oh umm . . . no !
i am sorry ! i did n't mean to smoke again . i m going to quit smoking .
i ve got to go to the supermarket too .
there we re !
good news ! they look great ! you are much more relaxed than you !
yeah i m ready to learn something like that . i don t know how to finding my makeup .
ok . i guess we can have a good time .
really ? what do you think ?
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i ve been thinking and well i think we need to start seeing other people .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
do you like this place ?
ok . we have the address .
have you had a perfect plan for this position ?
oh no . i broke your vase accidentally .
we re here . we can t wait to get there .
alright well let s go to the end of this one . i ll see what i can do . .
that s a great idea . you re a little nervous !
that s right . well it was my first date but we were married to get married in time . do you know what i mean ?
that s right . he s very cute . would you like to go with him ?
thank you for your hospitality .
let me go shopping . be careful !
oh yes i remember . i love the sand and the sunshine . . .
i disagree with you . they are all pretty friendly ! you know how to express their clothes and if i don t mind .
there s a plenty of time left . the city is so noisy .
yeah of course . but it s really fun .
oh i see . that was a great game .
really ? i thought you were gonna quit my job .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i went to the library and lost my bag .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i can t believe i was so sure i could do what i think about myself .
no it s not your fault . you re right ?
i do n't know . i guess i will definitely do that .
whoa ! i m sorry sir ! this is not a good reason for you ! we ve been here for more than a year ! i promise i ll miss you !
that s fine . i won t follow you any more .
wow that sounds pretty easy .
it 's such a beautiful girl .
i know . but i m sorry . . .
no the other one . . . yes .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes that 's fine . i think it 's the thing . can i try it on ?
where do they come from ?
geez ! you 're going to catch the ball !
that s fantastic ! i really don t know anyone about it .
that 's exactly what i have to do .
i pulled you over because it 's already healed .
oh i know . i m calling to tell you the truth i m reading them myself .
so what have you got this problem ?
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
there must be many other ways to keep the better schools .
no problem .
she is n't a <unk> .
no i do n't . after all i am grown up with my colleagues .
it was all day . just read your test .
i heard there is a beautiful river in your city .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
wait a second . he shoots he scores !
i think so . i 'll try my best .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
can i do that in the afternoon ?
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
oh hi andy . i just wanted to see him yesterday .
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
i hid so that it could n't see me . slowly it got closer and closer until . .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
just a minute madam . you should pay a deposit of 500 yuan beforehand .
yes . i ve only finished some paper . i think my favorite movie is around .
me too . they say i like chinese food as well . they 're both different from competitors and quarrels .
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
do n't be silly . i will build your deck with a simple but classic look .
yes it not only includes the nation's historical and cultural background but also contains the nation's view of life way of life and way of thinking .
what about the balance of the united states ?
definitely .
you mean you happen to find out when she 's in love ?
i 'll buy you a new one tomorrow .
it seems that marriage has been <unk> by many people in history .
it 's true . just hope people can make good preparations .
when do they get married ?
i thought you were right but you said your grandmother would make a good impression .
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
really ? can you speak english ?
i guess so . maybe they are just some kind of pants they can look into .
i feel they 're dirty .
i see . is that on a scale of purchase ?
that 's a good idea . you know that if you pass the university you 'll have to teach me .
there 's a service charge . everyone in my family is usually an unfortunate situations . it 's an american tradition to have good reputation for helping people to keep their desks .
well no . i would n't like some coffee . my songs are good enough .
can i try them on ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
does she live nearby ?
she is .
right so the rate is variable ? a return then ?
do people get married ?
well we have different manners in chinese . but some of them are independent .
he said he would celebrate his girlfriend 's birthday .
sure . if it is not broken about the broken color i will send it to you by mail .
we have a photo studio ?
oh that s too bad . why don t you take a look at the rash ? it s really cold . i m going to have to prescribe some ointment for it . if it s rash doesn t clear up in a few days .
here is the exchange . the room is chadwick and hacks .
i met with my parents at the airport and hurt my family .
but i keep playing with it . oh i 'll bet my button will you .
i m sorry . but i ve got a bad cold .
i agree . it 's really different . one thing i can say they were just too expensive .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
that 's true . she is pretty happy with you .
so you think it s harder to find out what is troubling them ?
do you have any sunscreen lotion ?
many people have never married a girlfriend because they offer a lot of good things to eat and eat .
yes we do . i think you 'll need to pay the full amount of your rent right now .
the kitchen is on the fourth floor . there s a special one on the corner of the city centre . it has a kitchen with a bathroom and kitchen . i am sure you can use the stairs to make one .
good . i think we have to get a bite tonight .
no problem . i will check your schedule .
it is . you can find out if you want to live in a band .
are there many things that are made in the house ?
i hope that i get enough sleep i 'm not tired .
it 's my new pendant . do you like it ?
well sir i have no main courses .
it 's an american song ! a few people go to the hotel first and sing all the piano for us .
actually i do n't know about it . there around 230 p . m .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
certainly .
exactly .
certainly .
what do they say ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
the <unk> were so good that i could n't have seen you .
but i would n't mind getting up early .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
no you are not right ! but they like good meal .
i do n't know . if you drink a lot of wine they have nothing to say .
yeah you are right . chinese food is so delicious .
the news says it ll be very expensive . what do you think about it ?
i 'm going to england .
what 's the meeting ?
maybe you 'll have to go to the party with her .
i love the show . i 've always wanted to see it for a while .
yes of course . i go to see my class three times a week .
ok . i need your name and credit card number to hold the room .
i do n't know . can i sit down ?
where are you going ?
i 'm planning to go to america .
yeah .
yes . our school has a very good reputation and it is very popular .
you have n't had any problem in life lately .
yes i do .
a flight must be taken off to the airport . you can go to the doctor to have a look at the <unk> .
just bring it to me .
yes i 'm on a business trip . i 'd like to travel very much .
ok .
i know . playing chess is a very exciting game .
there are n't many ways you can use . it 's easy to quit driving from a <unk> house .
read me that please . all right .
yes i 'm sure i will .
to be honest i was really excited about it .
really ? that s great ! i won a prize for best local history book at the annual sale price .
it was also a <unk> night in the 100th anniversary of the city .
no i do n't . i was really scared .
take it easy .
i 've got to go . you see i am really sick . i 've got to go .
but it is hard to believe this . you know they work hard at the office hours and now .
two years .
sorry that 's too late . i usually go to bed around 1000 pm .
i 'm a student . i 'll have to take a look at it .
it 's horrible . it looks very serious .
i appreciate you telling me .
what did you do ?
could you pick him out of a lineup ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
it wo n't rain today .
it will be a good night right now . i ca n't wait to try again .
i know . i have don t seen my feelings . but i feel uncomfortable when i get them .
well this is maybe i should go and get some new food . i ca n't afford to get the hospital .
that 's right i want to buy a drink first .
so what ? i 've got to treat you . i guess i 'll have to try it .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . .
no thanks . i can only get it myself .
not at all .
you were in china right ?
no i 'm not . i 've never had one before .
that 's a good idea to find a parttime job .
well in fact it 's the most important thing to go ahead of time . we ve got to have this problem with our credit card .
please .
he 's my grandma .
<unk> easy ! do you know how to use it ?
maybe .
cool ! they 're so cute .
well we shall make it a secret between us .
ok . i 'll look at the timetable .
sure . why not just send out to me ?
i love you too .
he is out of work !
no . why ?
how about a coffee in that cafe ?
no way !
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
so how long will it take ?
it 's so old . it looks like it was a 16 day .
well apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . typical is n't it ?
is she alright ?
well you should have kept eating less from them !
i am sorry sir . your plane has been canceled .
i know that . i think it s over there .
oh that s easy . i think it s nothing about my job .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
i had meetings back to back all morning . and phone rang off the hook from the minute i walked into the office .
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
maybe next time
you are welcome !
several minutes ago .
how do you think that 's a high fever ?
yes i am . i ve been out of town . my name s mike .
really ? but you re going to have to leave him here .
poor choice !
really ? i 'm glad to hear that . but i still think my father is in the hospital for now .
really ? congratulations ! what s your wedding anniversary ?
not yet . she 's still single .
really ? i m very surprised . he doesn t look like a guy who d ever do that sort of thing right ?
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
next june .
i guess you re right . i m glad you re enjoying it .
oh that 's right . you are the right person for me .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well . we started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done .
what will you do to know that ?
all the laundry will be ready by 5
that 's going to be a shame . who are you going to leave ?
i m so happy for the family !
do you have any plans for the party ?
the palace hotel .
i hope so too . if you ll be able to make another offer .
how old is she ? we don t have much house to live in .
you 're right .
there are 15 people in my family .
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
i have been married for three years .
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
ha ha i ll keep that in mind but don t tell my husband .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .
cindy s husband is ron .
how many children do cindy and ron have ?
they have two childrenone son and one daughteras well as one daughterinlaw and one soninlaw .
do they have any grandchildren ?
yes they have three grandchildrenone girl and two boys .
does their daughters get along well with her inlaws ?
yes she gets along with them quite well .
do they have a large family ?
their family is very similar to cindy and ron s family .
he s 21 . how old is james ?
he 's a year older than keith but he looks younger .
how high did you like him ?
he 's out of work . he retired last week . it 's turning point in his life .
can we get more ? i am sure he can spend more time with his grandchildren .
oh i don t think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
you said it . well is there anything else i can do for a change ?
how do you want to spend your old age ?
in the same way probably .
i 'm sorry . i did n't know that .
what 's your opinion ?
i heard you are settling in love .
yes mr . emory . he 's very good !
glasses ?
okay i 'll tell him .
yeah . i saw him last week . he was quite young fresh .
my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .

that s really a small world . let s go in and see how much money it would cost .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .

ok . did you get your passport ?
in most cases i have met the parents of my family when i was a child .
yes mr . chen . how can i help you ?
i 'd like to meet you this afternoon . i 've got to go now .
i have them with the sports section . they need to put up with feel as well .
you d better not cry or you 'll have black streaks running down your face .
yes i am looking for a <unk> .
ok i will do that .
ok i see . let 's go .
could i make an appointment at the airport tomorrow ?
you are welcome . have a nice day .
yes i did . it was one of the conditions of the insurance policy .
i see . what did you eat as a good job ?
i began to went there last month .
our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . can you serve them in english ?
i had a horrible accident .
what ? i had no idea . but now i 'm just not doing anything .
oh . i 'm glad to hear that . and i know you 're very busy .
you can renew your passport in a few months . if you want to apply for a cheque of more than one countries in the world .
yes . you have been very helpful and helpful . in fact i wish to be able to grow such a vegetarian .
well there s a special sale store on that basis . some of the things that we can help you with .
loan me some good ideas . the secret is to make sure you keep the company neat and clean .
we need to say something about the geography and america .
500 yuan . and if you buy it today there will be a 15 discount for you .
six weeks .
it 's business section .
yes we do . i think in some way it has become an easy way to remember .
oh i see . by the way there is too much competition from more than 20 years .
sure . there are several <unk> working days in my country . i plan to use my own until i get home .
maybe you 're right . but i think it 's just too difficult to overcome my shyness . i really appreciate that .
you 're welcome .
i am an excellent communicator . people trust me and come to me for advice . one afternoon my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . i made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .
do you think you need to be a good fit or this job ?
i tend to get bored easily and so love to keep myself challenged .
take it easy . next time you should keep your eyes from the treatment process .
it was 3 years ago and it was 6 .
that 's exactly where i was planning to go !
yes i work well under pressure and find it dimly . however i believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines .
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
i think my greatest accomplishment has been <unk> the hans account .
excellent . everyone is really happy with the sales .
i stick to my principles and keep to the rules . sometimes they just lack enthusiasm . when i get them involved with something constructive some of them change their attitude later .
i like photography very much . i used to be awarded second prize in a photography contest at our university .
very well . i see you are doing some well .
i have works in the past twelve years .
what will you be needing ?
i like photography very much . i used to be awarded second prize in a photography contest at our university .
interesting . and what did you learn from our school ?
my work has been paid by a bank account for yours . i want to work in the suburbs . it s not my job to take a job where we can work with clients .

more than 2000 now .
very good . how about your communication skills ?
i need to do mostly work filing and so on .

yes . i am in charge of the trading department .
i think you 'll have a very good chance of getting a visa .
what kind of work are you planning to work ?
if you buy a prepaid phone card worth it will be much safer .
thank you . i 'm glad that you give me a call .
fully agree . i do enjoy the convenience though i am still a beginner in using excel . the latest office equipment is more typefunctional . it combines fax machine copy machine and printer in one . it saves a lot of place one machine instead of three .
yes this machine is even smaller than those before .
when will we get one of those ?
you know our boss always trying to save the last penny . we have to use up the equipment first .
of course .
let me see . i will call you in a moment . shall i come back before an hour ?
where will you live during the vacation .
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?
of course not i appreciate that .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
yes i think i would be glad to .
that 's really true . did you get the statue of liberty ?
i think i have been studying english for almost three years .
do you speak english ?
well i think i should pay too much attention to the amount of money .
i am very active and energetic . i approach things enthusiastically and i do n't like leaving them half done .
sure . i like playing the piano with them .
i am quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .

i can begin to work right away because i am out of work now .

i 'm michael smith from eale corporation . pleased to meet you .
how do you do mr . zhang ? i 'm glad to meet you .
my first name is judy and my last name is wang .

i stay at no . 115 <unk> road .
can you find it ?
yes . it 's <unk> in my hotel room .
thanks . i 'll give you a call as soon as possible .
i 'm from china . what about you ?
here you go .
yes my birth date is september 22 <unk> .
yes i 'd like to . but my major is not very good at making a withdrawal .
how long is the holiday ?
you can use a deposit account the original machine and a bank .
that 's good . i 'd like to see some our personal information about our personal affairs .
phrases and sentence patterns are also very important . you should know how to use them .
may i know him after lunch ?
i am sure i can .
that s true . but don t forget to give them another ring .
yes you know it is .
yes . is that so important ?
i am steven . i am here to meet you .
i have been married for three years .
how many people are there in your family ?
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
who are the members of your family ?
my husband my motherinlaw my daughter and i .
working for your company ! as the top administrative assistant in your firm !
good answer miss zhanggood answer ! seriously though are you interested in staying in a stafflevel position or would you hope to move into management someday ?
well i have n't thought much about this . i think it 's too early to tell . what is the most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . if the company is happy with my work then i think i would like to consider other positions in the company .
i hope to major in english literature but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year so we ll see .
do you have any experience in this field ?
i am in nanjing university . i am a junior .
what was the university of pennsylvania ?
yes i remember it very clearly . the pain makes it hot and windy . it was very good .
what courses did you completed ?
project management . i was very interested in this course when i was a student . and i think it 's very useful for my present work .
do you feel that you have received a good general training ?
yes i have studied in an english training program and a computer training program since i graduated from university . i am currently studying finance at a training school .
what kind of work are you doing in this field ?
yes i passed college english test band 6 with good skill in listening speaking reading and writing . i have n't got any certificate of computer skills because i don t think certificates are necessary if what s needed is merely operating a computer . i think practically to know how to use a computer is more important . and i am quite familiar with microsoft office .
yeah i 've been working so much overtime lately .
really ? how come ?
my boss gave me a big project . i had to have it finished by this morning . it was so difficult .
you should n't work so hard .
i know but i work hard all the time .
what do you mean ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
i am studying languages .
what is your major ?
because i was quite interested in economics then .
where are you going on ?
above all my spare time i am learned that what is good for you .
what kinds of computer did you completed ?
i like no . 4 .
what other foreign film do you think ?
i 'd like to say i was an english student .
i received a bachelor 's degree . what about you ?
so it 's a long flight to london ?
i feel i will try to get along with our colleagues and get along with each other .
what do if i take my job in a job where we can work ?
i will do my best .
you have a yellow suit these days .
nice to meet you ! my name is peter smith .
this is my first day at work !
nice to meet you too !
well hope you will enjoy your first day !
ok ! i will if you have any questions about my schedule . what can you say for me ?
you are welcome .
are you done ?
i know i know . but if you can do it tomorrow just call me .
that 's right . we have no choice for which one to choose ?
i want my change .
will all right . that 's be fair .
that depends on how much you pay .
what about your company ?
we will stay with the same hotel . and i will do it for you .
the news is not just about it .
i know that .
say why do n't you come with us ? we have plenty of room .
that 's great . i will definitely get a raise if i fail to go .
according to the company rule we should start preparing for several days .
how about internet access ?
they are doing fine .
right so your english is good enough to study for .
i was reading about how some people get tricked or <unk> in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed ! then they are sold on the black market .
yes but i speak english with a strong german accent .
why do you think you can make yourself understood in english ?
it 's not your fault .
that 's right .
why do you plan to change your job ?
yes . maternity leave is mentioned in the contract but there s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . do you offer anything to fathers ?
well let s get started with our company .
i think they take care of a lot of things .
it s like a toy or a cool briefcase !
are you covered by employees or are covered by worker ?
yes i 'm really excited .
how much is the current account ?
quite a lot . not really good . they do give you those things up .
yes . maternity leave is mentioned in the contract but there s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . do you offer anything to fathers ?
what do you mean ?
that sounds interesting .
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i can speak a little french and japanese .
i guess basic speaking in the english is easier for chinese .
i learned to be patient professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .
yes i do . but i believe i met the right person at the university .
how do you speak spanish ?
i studied french at school but i ve forgotten most of it . i learnt some russian while i was studying there and now i study spanish in evening classes .
yes i think i am .
just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the third floor .
i see .
oh . . . i get a discount from 5 to 5 days .

take the right road and walk three blocks to the city .
yes sir . i 'll send it by air . have you ever been to paris ?
so what 's your favorite groups ?
i 'd like to but i think i 'm going to go .
just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the third floor .
i ll have to put it off our contract before the end of this month .
have you used any hotel services this morning or had breakfast at the hotel dining room mr . green ?
i will think about it . thank you .
i ve never had a computer before but i listen to it .
i 've made a good decision to pay my current account . it 's more than i was just thinking of doing my own work .
i have received some special training in computers .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
any other certificates ?
i found it a garage sale once .
can you say that again ?
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
what do i need to do ?
i got it .
in this case you should keep decent manners in the interview .
make sure you show the best impression of the interview and then you can win a lot of experience .
even if they are not careful you should try to prevent de sheets .
how dangerous ! i 've almost knocked him down .
but i should have brought many good impression on the resume .
it 's hard to say . now that i can see a pulmonary specialist who are that are afraid of losing money .
what about all these things ?
as a start of the day is between 1500 a . m .
yeah . that 's for the family .
sure . what i mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it 's in writing .
ok . where are you from ?
yes i do .
ok please ask me when you want me to know if you have any questions .
oh no . i m not really sure .
very good . you are always welcome in our company .
would you please tell me what time it is best for me ?
sometimes but not quite often .

you can use some time off .
they re 168 .
oh you 'd look great . you 're really responsible .
okay . here you go .
it includes your air fare your hotel accommodations and the meals .
that 's fantastic ! i had no idea and thanks for your help .
yes one last thing . how much holiday time do you give your employees every year ?
how can i know my strengths ?
i would like to work for you .
but i see .
why do you choose this field as your major ?
i 've been fed up with study .
no you should n't let the chance and do your personal information .
how long do you think it will take to get used to that school ?
yes i 'd like to speak to mr . wang but i 'm not sure whether i can work this out .
i am smith the manager . have you received my final test ?
that 's ok .
i think we 'll send you a letter next week if you are wanted or we may give you a call . by the way have you got a telephone ?
i think that the biggest problem in this area is a little higher .
all right .
i am sorry . that 's very important .
i am sure it 's nothing serious .
just put your name on the top of your card .
you can always put in front of other people 's eye contact .
how do you know if we take the test ?
i know i know that .
can i get that done ?
great ! warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . good good . this week work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . now let s take a look at this tricky section .

ok . i 'll give you the chance .

my name is mr . ford .
please explain to me the details for this position and i 'll give you an application form .
do i have to send one by email ?

is that so ?
yes i do n't want to be stuck in a rut . i want to move on .
have you decided ?
yes i want to get a better job .
could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .

i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
yes .
many people won t like that .
how do you plan to accomplish this ?
oh that 's the warehouse . we keep a stock of the faster moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock .
well we have here many benefits . but we 'll try our best to get them as soon as possible .
well i enjoy the popcorn and being with you . you re more important than the movie .
please let us know the customer is such a beautiful stock .
the point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too .
yes i have . i think she 's being a bit secure about her .
mr . bergeron . no one has made a mistake .
yes there are two brothers living here .
then please find out your proposal is very reasonable .
you know in the past five years we have the final decision . if you place a large order now let 's see what they have to say about . you can get a discount of 10 percent discount

i need to use the internet .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what do you mean ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
a working experience has been quite an important experience for chinese . however i don t think teamwork and cooperation are very important .
i understand . thank you for your consideration .
exactly the most important thing is to us that our quality is set up the deal with a problem of quality analysis . after the hard work it is set up and the end of the business . it seems that everything is set by us up a new contract .
i have never seen such as newspaper since i was at university .
no really ?
yes flexible aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
it sounds like you 've done a lot of work .
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
ha ha . well let 's make it easier for us to keep up the late .
yes some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
it s good to hear from you . this is good for you to keep your pressure and active .
sure it s not very good . can you play the piano with that ? you know we ve seen a lot of funny ground beef .
that sounds easy to get along with . first of all you need to learn how to practice and get on line to speak spanish .
have you ever considered taking a career of a consultant ?
what a <unk> !
i hate to disappoint you mr . brown but if that 's the case we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . do think it over please . we sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion .
there 's a lot of news in the us .

i am very active and energetic . i approach things enthusiastically and i do n't like leaving them half done .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
i am quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend in <unk> . the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
i graduated from songhua university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
project management . i was very interested in this course when i was a student . and i think it 's very useful for my present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .

i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed <unk> .

well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .

would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?
yes i would . after testing
many people won t like that .
yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let s go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism and this seemed like a g
certainly . and after your internship ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes . i see . but you decided to leave them in 2006 right .
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes he must . do you want to go there ?
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .

very interesting news . how do you feel about france ?
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
yes sir .
these two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . others are ordinary letters .
all right who should i send them to ?
it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok home or office address ?
office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .

of course not i appreciate that .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
do you have a cold ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .
well i 'll cancel your appointments for today . and i 'll tell mr . morley .
thanks ann . talk to you this afternoon .
hope you feel better .

i learned a lot when dealing with customers complaints and <unk> in high school . then i took part in a training program as a sales manager . i was also learning some training . i took part in university .

yes . i am very busy with the time . can you help me with the dinner ?
that 's not a problem . which loan was it you were interested in ?
oh i see . well i 'm sure you can do well .

well that seems to be a problem . i 'll have to take the full one and the other one please .
i have a deposit account with my bank . there are some restrictions on withdrawing money but the interest rate is much higher .

for me traffic jams are quite stressful because i m going to have no idea how to use the atm .
sometimes the dance floor is too noisy . i ca n't stand it .

oh great . let 's see if it 's a sunny day .
so i can think of it for a while i 'm here . i 've been working as a freelancer now .

it would be worth the trouble in that case . i 'll go down with the special packing .

my name is professor smith .
i am afraid this course is for four persons .
how many days of paternity leave do you offer ?
please accept my deep apology . i am sure we can meet each other again .

i would like to withdraw 300 .

they are blue samsonite bag .
fine . i 'll be in later today and thanks for calling .
could you tell me when it will be back ?
ok !
this pair fits me perfectly . i feel comfortable .
here is the money .
very expensive .
i would like to open a savings account .
would you like to stay with us ?
i want to deposit it into my checking account .
the hardcover is more expensive .
so they re going to be late for the family ?
have a nice journey lily .
do i want to make any changes to my old card ?
thank you . and what amounts do you want the checks in ?
could you say that or yourself quite a little bit ?
you are welcome . see you next time .
it looks delicious .
ok . that 's really something new .
all right . shall we discuss the schedule with our manufacturers ?
no problem . is there anything else i can do for you ?
right . here i ll take this one .
well i 'm sure we have covered all the contract . we could really use another one if you would like .
my mattress was supposed to be delivered today .
it 's the usual practice in our market . you need to take a look at the inspection system .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
great i ll need to know about the details of the letters you mean . thank you very much .
in some parts of our country we 've already been <unk> of our country .
the goods are wellexamined before shipment . i 'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route .
ok i will take three .
ok i will try .
we want to spend a lot of money making money into the production area .
so if i can get the promotion right ?
maybe i should try to find the best to make things <unk> .
i have no idea . you know several pairs of slippers . but if your order is a large order now we 'll have to discuss this contract with you .
all right . we can make it .
i know but our design is superior to any other products from other companies . you can t give us the same quality if you cannot accept the quality .
here is the money .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
oh no ! i 'd like to send it by registered mail .
there 's information on deposit or loan rates exchange rates . . .
can you read the characters ?
please .
i 've been looking forward to visiting your factory .
it 's ok . i 'm a beijing opera fan .
thank you very much .
you 're welcome .
i would like to say that i 'll be very happy to have this business with you . have a good idea of what you require ?
as you know our company has been rising in recent years and we re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent . our prices haven t changed much .
yes and what about the balance of the order ?
all right . please ask me to teach you how to get the signed add information of the contract .
so that 's the point .
oh i 'm a journalist . i 'm quite depressed . i 'm doing aerobics class in my family .
what do you do for a living ?
i am afraid i ca n't agree with you there . our agents in other areas in other areas usually get a 3 to 6 commission .
in this case you should pay more attention to the manager in the future .
ok . i think they are just a little different . but i also need to know about how things are .
that 's fine with me . i 'll come back at nine o 'clock .
when will we get a payment ?
i 'm afraid not . we accept any irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets gets paid in time . but on the other hand it would add to the buying costs .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
wow a lot of money ! how about the price ?
yes i agree with you . you know we have been talking for almost three years . i think you 'd better first have a chance to promote your company and the corporate relationship between us .
but i have forgotten about it .
i 'm sorry peter . but if you think about the price we 'll have to discuss it with our manufacturers for an earlier delivery .
no problem . i 'm too busy to tell you that i do n't want to finish this interview .
i see . you 're calling to say that this afternoon .
but now i 'd like to make a reservation please . . .
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
thank you . what time is your appointment ?
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
thanks . do you want to discuss them with us ?
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
if that 's the case there 's nothing to be done about it .
i can not believe it .
it 's all right . where are you going ?

yes but they will make the goods according to your business inspection .
can you weigh these for me please ?
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
can you say that ?
yes of course . if we order now the price is too high we can make a bid of large .
what 's the earliest time you can come back .
well . we only accept the payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents .
i see . could you make an exception and accept d a or d p ?
no problem . we 'll give you a definite answer .
still there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . it would help me greatly if you would accept d a or d p . you can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . it makes no great difference to you but it does to me .

you too .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
i ve been out of town . how about you ?
please tell me about your experience . . .
i 'm not sure . she said that she 's the right person in his heart .
could i have your name please ?
i would like to know more about the yen .
do i know how to do the shopping ?
i m sorry but i ve already been so busy .
see you ! i 'll just come back for lunch !
did you have a good journey ?
i 'm proud of you for standing by our bottom line . i think you re proud of your business .
that s okay .
well all the brothers and sisters get together and fill the christmas stockings for the litt 1e kids .
i know . you re not going to spend two weeks on the train to chicago .
yes i was a nurse and i had to look at her so i decided to come here .
in what way did they accept the general terms of basic ?
could you please tell me how much this balance has service be paid ?
well you might be right to pick up the market for an amazing opportunity . if that s the case then we can take the opportunity to make local inquiry .
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yes . can i see that tshirt on the top shelf please ?
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
