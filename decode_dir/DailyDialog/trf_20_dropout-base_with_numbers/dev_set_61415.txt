where is the new house ?
how long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?

where is it ?
why did n't you just answer my question ?
i have to work this tuesday .
where is it ?
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .

do you want anything to drink ?
yes what would you like to order ?
oh i do n't know . i 'd like the same thing with a friend .
well . it 's a monthly magazine but you have to pay a little extra .
that sounds great and plan to bring me some deep fried chicken .
in the meantime do you think seriously should be crazy ?
yeah . they said they were playing a lot .
i know that . he has an easy nose and a very good voice .
i agree with you .
here you are .
thank you .
i 'm afraid i do n't . but i do n't have any with me .
i 'll have a double whiskey on the rocks .
we have french and thousand island .
that sounds great . i 'll take some wine .
thank you . what 's the square number ?
what 's the weather like in new york ?
you should take a bus .
is that the university next to the city ?
that 's a good idea .
i 'm not really in a good mood actually . i do n't know how to call the boss .
what would you like to have for the appetizer menu ?
well i prefer staying at 100 .

anything else ?
i 've got whiskey and brandy but i need some beer and soda .

oh i 've heard that . they 've got an excellent variety .
that 's all you have to do .
i 'd like to go to the cinema . and i want to go do some sort of tired .
i don t want everyone to get a jar of spinach and blue . we should also get a bean bag and a delicious flavor .
no thank you . i do n't like chocolate .

yes . we 're out of milk .
well it 's going to be 25 .
no not yet . i just want to hair cut .
ok . how do you like it ?
i do n't like the feeling .
wonderful ! i 'll go with you .
how much is the charge ?
it 's worth it .
i think it 's too expensive . i 'll take it .
this television is of very high quality .
why do you think that this would be a good move ?
certainly . how about this one ? it 's made of pure silk and it 's the same color .
have you decided what wine you would like ?
i want to see the menu . would you please tell me how to use the menu ?
how would you like the steak rare medium or welldone ?
i like it very much .
this means digital camcorders can be connected with the digital equipments you have at home like your digital tv or your computer .
well what about your arm ?
i just got a job .
yes i am .
i do n't think that i will take it .
you know i 'm trying to quit it . now it 's not a piece of cake .

i would like to speak to your director of human resources ms . jenkins please .
that 's true . it was nice talking with each other .
have you got a wang at the hotel ?
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with .
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
i realize that i have to buy you a ticket and i do n't know what to get .
ok . what do you want me to do ?
are you sure ?
hi .
certainly . what day did you work ?
how long do you want us to keep it ?
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
thank you . i 'll be sure to do it .
if you agree to pay more money i ll have to borrow more money .
you 're right . i will do it right now .
no i 'm afraid it 's only 5 minutes .
ok we 'll be expecting you at 1130 then . see you then .
i 'm sorry . the police will not come and i will connect you to the bathroom in the bathroom .
i got the message . i 'm quiting .
i need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks . can you deliver ?
probably not . doing that will probably take another three hours which i ca n't afford now .
how many nights a week is it ?
it costs ten cents a copy .
can i pay by card ?
no problem .
i realize that i have to buy you a ticket and i do n't know what to get .
ok . what do you want me to do ?
where are you living now ?
is it far from here ?
i think a cab is better .
oh excellent ! how much does it cost ?
you 're welcome .

it s all july 5 .
i see .
hmm . sounds terrible .
hmm . that s a lot of money i guess .
yes .
are you ready to transfer tomorrow ?
i 'm not sure what 's wrong with it .

that 's great .
i 'll give you five more minutes then i 'm going on without you !
yes i bought a few things .

do you think you can make a fuss ?
we usually have different kinds of chinese food here .

it is unnecessary .

yes what kind do you have ?
i 'm also going to need a gift .
i 'll have a tomato juice and some iced tea .

i 'm not surprised .
no . it 's only a few minutes walk .
how far is it ?
you 're welcome .
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
that d be great but could i have a cup of tea first ?

that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .
i see . well i can help with the chores while i m here . you two could probably use my help .
that s very nice of you to offer . here s your tea . be careful it s still quite hot .
it 's just around the corner .

yes now i 've been here for two years .

oh well . i 'll have to live with it . what else can i do ?
oh you have to go to the second floor .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just want to try it on ! what do you think ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that might be going overboard a bit . how about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
that 's a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing .
that s even better than the real thing .
if you re not thin you ll need to buy a big one .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
sure . let me help you .
yes i 'm looking for a house .
this is kevin .
no . i have to buy a flat at the hotel .

how about at 1100 ?
fine .
what else can i get for you ?
yeah i 've never heard of that before . it 's called a website called shopping store and they 're always making phone calls !
i suppose the government should do a large amount of money in the country .
that 's right . in europe the university of china is a traditional trade center of the country .
that 's something that you really need to work on .
well i think i 'm in a bit of a hurry today .
i can be found a lot of information about it .
they are all very well but the first thing that you will have forever .
i want to try on this pair .
the round shape pair ?
and fruits and vegetables are very <unk> .
thank you .
i agree how much ?
you just said 10 rounds .
sure but i do n't drink much . so i do n't know what to order .
so how about an aperitif ?
it sounds good . i 'd like to start with a compare .
stirred or shaken ?
stirred will be fine .
here you are .
thank you .
sure . all of our mixed drinks are excellent . you can also try a delicious nonalcoholic cocktail .
can you recommend one ?
try a singer . it has lime juice and grenadine over ice .
it sounds interesting . i 'll take it .
here we go .
it tastes great .
enjoy yourself .
yeah .
i 'd rather not . i do n't like chicken soup .
i do n't like that . i do n't like instant coffee . it 's supposed to be good for you .
it 's a letter from ray and sue in shanghai !
i do n't like ice cream with too much of it . i 'm on the other side .
how do they eat it ?
are you kidding me ?
they 're soft delicious .
i would like to have the coffee rum pies .
i know i know . i 'm going to quit my job .
all right . i 'm going to mrs . wilson .
i 'd like the lasagna please .
it could be good for you to eat brunch .
not at all . you can have a taste of chinese food .
blah . . . what 's that ?
ok . i will send someone to fix it .
what do you mean by that ?
you 're welcome .
it 's really great . but i like it very much .
well then may i suggest you get a burger ?
how much does it cost ?
i 'm a holiday in the city centre of italian restaurants and i 'm a little bit too excited .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i am the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
i 'm here for the backpack you announced several minutes ago .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
she is a sensible girl .
is she old or young ?
what did you do ?
do n't worry . you have to do fine . and we have to open an account for our consultants .
now you can buy your new car for me .
well i have got your name and phone number .
how do you like it ?
and you may use cardboard boxes for outer packing so long as you can bring it back to us .
are you scared of anything ?
we are sorry for that . may i have your name and room number please ?
then why do n't we go to work ?
may i know what you do ?
so then why do n't you drive it ?
would you like to reserve a table for us ?
i don t like the way to get all the groceries in your groceries . would you like to go with me ?
oh that 's easy . i will do that .
i woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day but i was wrong . a twist of fate brought us together . i crashed into your life and you into mine and this may sound crazy but i m falling in love with you veronica .
yeah i guess i should .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what time did she start to sleep ?
let 's take a roundabout way .
ok . i 'd like to change some euro into my stay here .
yeah . let 's just get a cab .
i 'm afraid not .
yeah i know what you mean . i just want to ask you more questions about your new job .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
well i think you should do a good job .
yes . there is one more thing .
it will be used as a clean one when the room is ready .
would you like a different home ?
i 'm sure she is .
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner .
how long will it take me to get there ?
about fifteen hours .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good idea . let 's go now .
all right .
i have a laundry done about it .
is it in that case ?
i wrote the check out for too much .
yeah it 's nice to say this meal .
that 's for sure .
of course . please sit down . how can i help you ?
great ! i ll take it .
we re going to have to do an investigation .
of course i ve been trying to call you the last thing i ve been keeping them all by the way ! thank you for your help .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . would you mind telling me what your number again ?
thank you .

what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
what about the price ?
their flesh is soft and juicy . it 's a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
what kind of house is it ?
how about oil or spray ?
sure .
how much would you like ?

very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
i am sorry . you can t return it because of the dial tone .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
since everyone is different your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . then you 'll be taught all the necessary techniques to use these equipments and achieve your goal .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .

yes i know . kind of hard to concentrate is n't it ?
would you like another beer ?
well all the chinese dishes have been <unk> for the past few months .
i think i might have the right order .
well . i 'm not sure where it is .
any place will be fine .
oh it s just a few minutes walk . you ca n't miss it .
that 's too bad . i do n't know the through train .
i m a tourist in the city .

i think it s time to go .

yes almost all the families have their own cars .
yes . we 're going to have to cancel the reservation .
hmm . . . how come it 's a pity . can i get something to drink in the concert ?
we can t do that . it looks like we re going to have to cut the ball .
well could you pick up some sugar ?
sorry but i 've gotta go .
what happened ?
i 'm not sure . let 's do it .
i m afraid he won t .
he did n't hurt anything .
it s a great idea .
exactly .
are you a hurry sir ?
what happened ?
what is the problem ?
i m a bit excited about this year .
how about this one ? i think it s worth a great time .
ok . thank you .
but your rent is huge .
what do you think of the pollution ?
can i try it on ?
well i had a meeting with some colleagues and i d prefer a didn t to take the seat and talk with the fax machine .

please take me to this address .
ok .
i have to be there before 17 o 'clock .
ok see you .
that 's very kind of you . we will do it for you .
i will . thank you .
here 's twenty dollars .
well it 's 12 .
oh i am sorry .
yes of course . here you are .
yes i do .
hello madam . where are you going ?
can you please take me to the airport ?
ok . thank you .
i 'm completely lost . i 'm trying to call you again .
3 . 5 dollars .
here is the money .
it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
will you be able to get it off ?
how much is it all together ?
ok i am sorry .
thank you .
hi lucy .
sure . come in .
thank you . and what is your date of birth ?
i 'm sorry i 've got plans .
i got the message . i 'm quiting .
that 's no problem .
see you .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i am sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time do you expect him back ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i will call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the transportation is convenient .
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
300 per month .
well i 'm very interested in the job .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to pay to go to school .
the problem is that i have an important meeting to him .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello !
wow ! that sounds like fun .
i went up on my way to the wedding day and i had n't held up yet .
i 'm very tired .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
well i 'm glad you came .
thank you .
the same to you . but you must take the test .
what time do i need to make an appointment for ?
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i came two years ago .
i think a bunch of people will be out of the company and complete it .
she 's pretty easy to get along with . she listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .
what is her strongest trait ?
well since it is n't . so you will have to wait at the next stop and bus station .
that 's a great idea . he used to be a jazz group at the university .
what position is that ?
how much does it cost ?
i 'll be there .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we have the best <unk> in the country !
well i m looking for a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a lot of room for the cold days .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
no ! i m going to cut the cake and it s about time .
you can t take me to jail !
i know ! it s going to be great ! who s he doing ?
what 's the cause of gas ?
we can t go to the park without you ! don t you think it s an automatic message ?
i know . i just ca n't help shopping . why do n't we go get some ?
oh peter ! i will be at those places .
there was a big car . you can t just kick your car .
yes . i m looking for a job as a clerk typist in english .
are you looking for a souvenir shop ?
i want a pair of cigarettes . i don t have any need for me .
what s your camera ?
quite right . if you want to take the one with me the insurance company the insurance company will have to offer you a few months .
no problem .
thank you very much .
that s amazing . and so what do you think of the national park ?
you think it s a bit too cold for that .
i can do that . i heard that an uncle likes parties but he said that he would probably have a small collection of animals experiments is being used in a world .
wait a minute you have a taste . . . here we are .
i don t know . that s a problem .
what is the new ford ?
i 'm sorry . but i just want to order something else .
i m sure it ll be fixed .
that s right .
i see .
no problem john .
i 'd like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
yes . there is one more thing .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
let s go take a look at the menu first .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i want to return this video .
do you like the new style of red wine ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
do you offer a big family tour ?
very good sir . we have many fresh options available at home especially for the weekend . what kind of apartment are you looking for ?
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes i do .
i m sorry to hear that !
it s a pity that i can t afford that .
it sure did . great wall brings me a lot of beautiful music .
good news !
i think it is .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it s so nice of you to say so . i ve got something cold too .
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
what size do you wear ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there is no hot water and many other small ones .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s a great idea to wash a bedroom and a cool kitchen .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
i d like to get a lot of the city life life .
i have n't thought of that .
yes it 's fully furnished .
would you like to have a drink ?
it s only 725 a month .
that s way too much .
what account do you want to go to this address ?
what are you going to do with it ?
that s not a problem .
thank you very much .
would you please reconsider ?
that s a lot of work .
i m not sure . i just don t know anything .
yes i do it a lot . but i do n't like doing dishes . what about you do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yes i know that . chinese food is becoming more expensive than chinese food . so i came to here for a long time .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
very well . do you want your supplies ?
could you have a look at that new cereal i think ?
i am afraid i would n't have a look at the ones . you can always try on the other .
i don t know . but if you could give us a discount i think the price is too high .
you ll have to get a lot of the day in the city .
well i just want to do the same thing with you .
i think so . i bought a black coat and a black shirt at the latest .
that 's good . what 's the price of the hardcover ?
what else would you like ?
the brown one you have on looks fabulous especially with the formal dress .
i m afraid i have to arrange one of these things .
do n't mention it . you can do the shopping cart .
speaking .
do i need to pay any change ?
yes of course . the apartment is on the tenth floor . there are many small apartment available in the suburbs which one do you want to move on ?
i 'm not sure .
all you have to do is fill out the paperwork .
all right . see you then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
yes i 'm over there . maybe you can ask the person to get down the market .
good morning .
ok .
no but if you 're good you can bring a bottle of wine .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
oh i 'm sorry . the price is on sale now . you ca n't be helped .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it has two bedrooms . that 's convenient .
if only we could take a few days off work or even rent a car .
in the meantime do i still have to pay for it ?
with so few windows how can you even see what the problems are ?
do you have a balcony ?
it s a great idea .
did you check the bedroom ?
i don t want any discount .
three . two adults and one kid .
it is now a great company . it has a an amazing project coming up for the weekend . she is very interested in it .
it looks like it s a plan to go on the top of the stores .
in the meantime do i still have to pay for it ?
sure .
it 's great i can help you find a greener city to the city .
wow this place is so beautiful . i love the beautiful and the big flowers in the garden .
i love it !
thank you sir .
that s the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter i think .
speaking .
hello i m calling to see if you have made your decision . you are the right person we are seeking for .
where are you going to go ?
i 'd love to but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
who was the director ?
i have no problem with 6 p . m .
by the way i would be a stranger here .
ok . i 'll call you when i check out .
we have some catalogues from u . s . universities .
should i do anything else with me ?
no but if you 're worried about anything else you can bring for your personal help today .
yes i 'm looking for a house .
well you could get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have a great variety of online edition . you can also get discounts for free .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
that 's interesting . could you give me the specifics ?
well i see . good for you .
yes .
i got the message . i 'm quiting .
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . . . you know he is really strict with the boxes . he never buys anything .
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
i m not sure .
i got the message . i 'm quiting .
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
oh i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
how would you like your haircut today ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
i 'm just going to get my things done .
with the front i 'd like a shampoo .
oh it 's the end of the interview .
not long . just a little .
yes sir .
i 'm not sure . i think i 'll wear this color and it 's just the latest style .
i think that i can help you with the job well . it is a little tough .
no you do n't need a cut . you 'd better move on to the head .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yes i do .
i got the message . i 'm quiting .
i just want to remind you that my friend is getting married next time .
i see . but why do you worry about yourself ?
i 'll just have to pay for it .
it 's a waste of money .
oh i 'll try .
yes . we have an appointment at eight .
the tie is necessary for you to play on the right side of the mountain .
all right . you 're all set .
i think so too .
oh you know i know . what do you think of the local newspaper ?
what happened ?
where is the place ?
i will go check out the kitchen next .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
is it on the house of course ?
i do n't like it very much . we went to a really good place . it s on our own .
yes . i have to take the bus .
where is it ?
how long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?
where is the place ?
it s a good idea to get a lot of information in a particular country . but if you want to live in an apartment that would probably be expensive .
where is it ?
why did n't you just answer my question ?
i have to work this tuesday .
where is it ?
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
actually i am not sure about the coffee even though we may have to go to the movies .
are you ready to go ?
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
what kind of food do you usually eat ?
i prefer sea food .
yes . i like chinese food very much . i like chinese food very much .
i 'd like to buy some things for my birthday .
how much is it ?
i like spaghetti . do you like spaghetti ?
sure ! in that case i would like to go to the chinese restaurant for fun . actually i 'm not sure of it . we have our guest room on the guest room to choose ! it 's a special restaurant .
not at all . i do n't really know what to order .
do you like some soup ?
i 'll start with chinese food .
well have you ever had lunch in restaurant before ?
you are not going to have a taste for it .
hmm . . . you 're really delicious .
we are here to help you . what do you need ?
that 's very nice of you . by the way how about this sweater ?
i know that . so what should i do with the find it ?
i know . but i do n't know if i need him to call me back .
sorry but you may have to leave it here .
rin ?
you 're welcome .
no nothing in particular .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
you should know the details of the products i think .
what 's the counteroffer between the two ?
when do you begin to leave ?
they are clothes here .
i was not born yesterday .
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
i want to spend my money on the shirts .
i 'm afraid not . i 've got one here .
that 's a great idea . you can go to the local supermarket for a weekend .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
that 's strange . i was telling you now that i am a little nervous . i am at the moment and i am at the moment .
yes . her company is a little tight in the waist area . and the wood floors are in the back . i was afraid to be a little more comfortable .
i do n't want to buy a gift .
the late fee is 25 cents a day .
how do you think of the blue dress ?
ok i 'll get the bellman to help you .
yes i 'm looking for a job as a clerk typist in english .
let me see . oh you re welcome .
i do n't have it .
is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ?
i just remembered that i 've got a date of date and i ca n't take it anymore .
go and try it on .
i see .
i think i 'd better take a look at the pamphlet .
how about the price ?
i see . would you come with me to look at the rate for the room and change ?
well i have to pay for it now .
i 'm glad you are . we 'd like to be able to give you a definite answer on this problem .
i think that the doctor will return it by the end of the week .
i 'm glad you 're satisfied with our safety period .
here you are .
thank you .
well . . . i do n't have a problem with it .
when will you be back ?
sure go ahead .
i ve got a lot of work to do . i can t take it .
anything else ?
is anyone else sick in your home ?
anything else ?
have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?
it 's possible because everyone knows that americans would love to give their fast food .
i 've never had a restaurant that i could take . . .
my guest needs working place . as you can see the sun i also set a little oil and some fresh air .
you know what ? i mean . . .
when i was a child i thought the same thing on me . i always forget that we did n't go out to the school .
well that 's not true . i like fried food and going to be tasty .
i did n't know that . i want to give them my parents a little trouble .
no i did n't .
yes i do it very often .
that 's my little more than i was thinking of ! now that you have a german hollywood ! that 's really like a song !
i usually try to go to church .
yeah i m going to cut out all the time . you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
but junk food is so easy . it requires no silverware or plates no rigid mealtimes no pleases and thank yous .
that s a great idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like . classical music might make you clever but dance might make you livelier and happier .
well i use breast stroke for long distance crawl or free style for example just for fun .
basically i think you should invite her over for dinner sometime . actually i was thinking of going out for a while . we could have a drink at a chinese restaurant sometime .
not at all . i 'd like to try the chef s steak .
what do you think of that ?
i 've never tasted anything better .
yes . i always order fried chicken for lunch . i am pretty good at poker . do you know how to get food ?
i like almost all kinds of stuff .
it 's all good . i have prepared some seafood .
yes that 's it . now here is your bill .
it 's the fun . you should not be disappointed .
i 'm having a low fever .
how many ?
i 'd like to have some chocolate .
of course it could be .
no . i only want chinese food .
just a beer please .
now that i think it 's what you drink .
good idea !
i 'll try that .
no . it 's my treat .
not really . i wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . do you want to go with me ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy .
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i think i can find something from the menu .
yeah why not . do you want to eat all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
i bake chicken because it 's a healthy way to eat it .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white .
yes i do . i have to go to a disco first .
i 'm not sure .
i 'm going to make myself a snack .
i do n't know what to make .

i was thinking of pizza .

i did n't plan on cooking tonight .

this is worth trying .
i think so . i do n't like meat but i got a little on the grill . i think it s too hot .
that 's great ! i 'll take you to a restaurant on the second floor .
are you kidding me ? it 's an expert of going to be a vegetarian .
i think maybe it 's going to be a little more complicated .

no i have n't .

i went to the library and lost my bag .
well i have been in this town for more than ten years .
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
i think he might be right .
i think i want to try a new style .
how about this game then ?
i 've been studying english since primary school .
i know what you mean . i thought you 'd ask him if we could do something .

the library will be at six o clock .
i like chinese painting .

i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no but i do n't .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
well i am new here and i can also use the credit card .
what is the suspect ?
i 've got a fever and really a bad headache .
sometimes you do n't have to worry about it i will try my best to get along with them .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
well i think i know a place that should work out the door .
can i have a try at the new year ?
i 'm fine . thank you .
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
i 'm going to quit to america .
i 'm sure you 'll enjoy the life of it .
do you like a house or a small house ?
it 's no use arguing the toss .
see you .
i just want to leave and discuss my temper .
i woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day but i was wrong . a twist of fate brought us together . i crashed into your life and you into mine and this may sound crazy but i m falling in love with you veronica .
i have never been to learning english .
i have to work this tuesday .
i have been doing yoga for 2 years and i still have n't had a chance to learn yet .
not really . but if you are going to be class you should take a seat .
i think so too .
it 's all right . i am in a hurry .
i want to make sure the world is a world of world economy class .
do you have any experience in this field ?
i see .
i have to work this tuesday .

i was told that the end of the month i was on sale .
no problem . we have a good view at the theater in the south .
how long will it take to get my things back ?
sure . i just got here a few minutes ago .

i know . i m a little nervous but i don t know how to do that .
i do n't know . . .
you re going to take courses ?
yes i 'm going to take some university courses there .

yes he does .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .

ok i got it . thank you very much .
you can check out two books at a time .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
for two weeks . after that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer .
ok . thank you very much for your trouble .
i can help you with that .

you 're welcome .
my name is sam .
my name is james .
nice to meet you too .
yes i 've been here for three years . what about you ?
can i help you get ready ?
may i ask you for the dance ?
that depends . but i don t know how to play the piano as well .
is that right ? wonderful ! i 've been in king dao for two years now . a great place . nice people and great beer ! well i guess we d better get started .
why do you say that ?
i am going to visit japan .
does he have a family who is really looking for a holiday ?
and the stove is brand new .
yeah i guess you 're right . but you never made an agreement .
wow ! i 'm just not really sure about it . i 've never had a great time .
it 's no problem at all .
i was an aerobics team member in college .

you are free . what is your stand on gay marriage ?
ok . i 'll pick you up at six .
i took a parttime job last semester in translating and doing reception work for an exhibition . my work included hosting the visiting foreign exhibitors communicating with them arranging their agenda and translating several materials . i think this activity well demonstrated my ability in english . and i will be glad to take any form of english test you arrange for me to prove my ability .
you speak english very well .
oh yes that 's in what you 're saying . and what do you think ?
and all that 's what i thought .
no but i got a parttime job in a contest .
let me take your temperature .
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
did you guys go on a date already ?
yeah .
i thought you were making a good choice . anyway the music class itself is just a lot of experience .
i do n't know .
well i took this course last semester . he was the art exhibition of united states . so i became a student too .
you did n't have to take a lot of time .

well first it 's all about the secret to a successful oral presentation . you should be able to first learn something about the weekend .
wonder why they do that !
of course . i will try my best to assist you . but you know we are very busy right now .
why ? you didn t tell me about that !
well you might consider it . you ve already worked in a foreign country for it .
then i might want you to have a try .
i m fine celia . and you ?
i m ok . i m so busy !
do you have a lot of homework ?
not yet .
of course i do !

do you want to go to an empty classroom ?
that sounds good .
good just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class . good luck !
oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
yes he does .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
what do you mean ?
oh you are a <unk> . that 's a very famous pavilion . we can go through the acceptance of the <unk> .
no there is not .
ok . i 'll make sure and get it for you .
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i 've got a headache .
what about ?
i m not too clear on some things about my lease .
oh is that all ?
i just need to see some id like a passport for example .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i haven t been to the university of ohio in america .
i understand .
do you have any experience in management ?
i remember a case that was filled with obstacles . the first thing we did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . i assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . i was able to get some input from another lawyer i happened to see at lunch . through some hard work and fact digging i was able to find a way to find a way to overcome most
what ? what is it ?
i think it s time for a picnic .
what do you mean ?
so what ? i bought that outfit just now !
i think you re right . i just want to try something new .
you are really a naughty boy .
i m fine .
how was your flight ?
i need to make a deposit .
what do you need to do ?
i need to use the internet .
did you check the periodicals ?
i didn t think of that .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
i see .
do you have any more skirts in this style ?
thank you very much . by the way where are the vegetables ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
this is the same size . two of the men in the world .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
can you live there ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i need to make a deposit .
will you be all right ?
i have it right here .
can you show me which charges you re referring to ?
how much is the fine ?
yes i 'm sure i 've done a lot of house painting in my life . and my mother was very picky . if i got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture she would get furious . so i learned to be very careful .
you re not nervous are you ?
i 'll buy it for 2000 .
i don t understand why i pay for that .
thank you very much .
how long can i keep the books ?
could you show me your id please ?
i need to return a book .

yes i do .
will you be paying with cash or check ?
uh . . .
i can come in at three and four what time works out best ?
i think it 's a bit chilly in the morning and it is not very hot . so you will have to stay in the afternoon . do you want to go home and take a rest ?
see you then .
we are at 2368 king street east .

yes this is the latest model . if you like it you can try it on .
that 's the excellent thing . let me see . . . your eyes and the smooth thing is to say . .
i think
could you tell me how to get there ?
no i think it is just a chance to get a master 's degree . you can do it well .
ok . i 'll make a list for you .
that 's what i should do .
they 're due to the cable industry .
just let the say . . . we should be in touch with the ceo of the boss .
should we take a bus or a taxi ?
about 13 hours . and i 'll give you a discount of 4 .
do you have anything else i can have instead ?
eighteen . some friends are having a birthday party for me tonight . they are doing a lot of fun .
well most of the students are in charge of the original industries that can provide the excellent service .
my moblogging is a <unk> .
i still think nobody plays for nothing .
it 's a quarter to 12 . i am sure it will be on the other side of the earth .
so it 's really early to keep the eyes from the sun ?
how about a china vase ?
that should n't be a problem . . . what should i be able to do ?
well we will get a promotion at the first half .
i come from the windows of a few different languages .
you mean i have to do something to do ?
no .
i know . do you have a pen with you ?
i think the best way to first is to be able to get together and be opportunities to relax . if i have n't finished finished finished finished doing well i think if i can get the opportunity of the team .
so it 's really early to tell the truth . i 'm not sure .
get a soft drink .
that should n't be a problem . thanks for your help .
first you need to put your name and contact information in the office .
oh my goodness . what a pity !
when i first i want to know if i am hired i will be a student in the future .
why do you need to take it ?
no i am not .
take it easy ! do you want to come with me ?
i think first of all i can do just to make sure that they are brief . i also should write a list of things that we need to learn more about how to do better .
for what ?
do n't worry . i 'm sure my mom will be here in a minute .
but i think this one fits me well . i would like to order it .
i need to make a withdrawal .
what s the problem ?
i sure do .
what s the matter ?
yes i would .
would you please fill out this form ?
do you want me to fill out this form ?
now i want you to look some pictures .
here you go .
you re so kind .
i appreciate it .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
you did ?
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
that 's a great relief . i was a great uncle . i hope he could be able to get him something done .
the operation was very successful .
his parents must feel very happy .
i don t think she will do such a thing .
i will . see you then .
maybe you are right .
but i like its color .
what color do you like ?
i 'll take one too .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh i see . i 'll take that one .
yes i see . but i have done a lot of good job in my previous job .
how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
i have n't even gotten it yet .
it 's a great game .
what do you mean ? he s a liar .
why do n't you go to bed and get up early ? you 'll have the same time for work .
i m a good student . i ve tried my best and i could be a good singer . you know i could also meet each other in the kitchen when they made some friends .
wow ! that s really good . and my favorite coffee . then i got an idea of having a lunch at home .
yes . it s supposed to be a rush hour s to get to the train station .
me too . but i m going to be so happy for you .
no your first year . i m sorry to hear that . you have a bad cold .
hmm . . . yeah ! i ve been in an apartment for two hours !
same to you ! the company is their personal wealth management service .
that 's interesting .
because he 's supposed to be my date .
it s a good idea . but my grandmother never said that she would be a good thing .
great . then maybe we should put together some more time and make sure that it is gonna be easier to get together and allow her to install it in a few weeks .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
i appreciate you telling me .
yes ?
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
why ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
who won ?
what 's up ? you 're all set .
sounds like you 've got a lot of homework .
you were sitting in the living room watching tv .
well it looks like you have a suite for 4 o 'clock . we should go to the same restaurant .
what 's up ?
you must have the same time .
you are suspected of hiding illegal drugs . so we are taking you into custody .
so you did n't .
right here . see the scratch ?
it 's all my fault . but i hope he can do whatever i can .
you know what this is going to be ?
no .
it looks like it may rain .
then i will bring my best .
what was the charge for ?
exactly what do you mean ?
you cannot judge a book by a famous company .
i know . she 's very healthy .
you are why not ask for a date ?
i feel like a little breeze and a lovely moon .
where are you from ?
i can t afford about that .
here we go .
well he 's the first person i 've met on my internet .
i 'm waiting for someone .
she 's a bit nervous i do n't know .
just when you leave ?
i like the plot .
well i 'm not going to tell her . i 'm in love with you .
i feel sorry for her .
i think you two should try to patch things up .
no i did .
it 's a total ripoff of an american reality show but the imitation is unbearably clumsy .
this is kevin .
fine . maybe i 'll call back later .
i hope not . it 's all my fault .
oh i 've been waiting for that .
what 's it look like lady ? this is the cream i 'm standing in is n't it ?
if he could be your wife and baby do something like that .
the teacher 's fault for mixing the two broths !
and what 's your brother in ?
oh i am sorry to hear that . i know there is a big problem . is that true ?
okay . take care .
my computer did n't tell me about it .

yeah i 'm back . thanks for calling .
that 's what i thought . i 'd get over it .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . would you like to go to another restaurant ?
it 's george . he is the boss of the company .
it 's the same as usual . we need to establish from our country .
it 's what 's wrong with my car . my car is n't working well .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . when did you tell me what i meant to see you .

but we just drove across town . ca n't we just go to see him one last . .

i did n't know you had such wild friends .

it 's already 10 minutes now .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .

i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 pm this thursday afternoon . please come on time .

i have to work this tuesday .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
i don t know .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong .
sounds great to me ! if we go together with us i 'll be there .
good idea . let 's go now .
great .
it was me . i am so sorry .
it 's ok .
i think it is amazing . you can enjoy both the traditional chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . the only thing i did n't enjoy was the subway .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
i 'd like to try some kebab roasted squid and many different appealing things .
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
ok i will but let 's go to a disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
what time is it available ?
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
is 's <unk> ! i have to be in rome by five .
what 's the hurry ?
i just stayed at home and watched tv .
i 'm sorry to hear that . why do you think you 're all right ?
i 'll be glad to help you . what 's the problem ?
i 'm looking for a pair of shoes .
oh sorry to hear that . i 'm going to get you to the doctor 's home .
i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
really ? what did you do ?
no but i 'm afraid it 's the time for holiday .
how about the steak ?
it 's too small for me to wear .
well i 'm not sure . let 's go dutch .
well it all looks like you have a red bean bag and a glass of red wine .
you 're welcome .
sure . i like hot food especially sichuan cuisine .
can i use the stairs ?
sure .
well then please wait a moment .
coffee please .
it s a pity about that .
yes i do .
thank you . what s your occupation mr . smith ?
not today .
sorry the exchange rate is full .
it 's too high for me .
i have n't seen you for ages .
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
actually i 'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
i can t believe it .
i m so sorry to hear that .
well i really do have to go . but i really will do my best .
do i have to pay to use the whole day ?
oh . that s almost right . i don t know .
here 's the money . i 'd like you to buy a watch .
what was the rent ?
well i hope they re paying you the big bucks for all this work . . .
what is the advantage of having good quality ?
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
a little bit . . .
i was almost an hour late .
great . i hope you can do it .
all right . thank you . by the way where are the ingredients ?
you know that i care for you . i care about your family .
can you describe it ?
you think ?
yes . it s a lot better than mine .
what are your hours ?
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
thanks .
is that a better game ?
thanks a lot .
you are always so busy in the morning .
of course i do . i 'm not a good swimmer .
you 're not going to be late .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i will take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . .
okay you are all set .
it 's pretty . how much is it ?
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
i 'm going to have to write you a ticket .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
me too . what s the weather like there today ?
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and forget and forget and forget and forget and forget that i ll be great party .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
you did ? where is it ?
thanks for saying so .
what do you think is the most important thing for me to do ?
anyway i think i need a nose job and some breast implants as well .
you d better get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on you can be serious ! i ca n't stand my job .
thanks for the vote of confidence justin !
but i want to make myself more money !
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know but i find these sorts of things hard to say . they wo n't like it if i had to .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you think that many people believe that you are a good friend ?
i have n't seen you for ages .
i woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day but i was wrong . a twist of fate brought us together . i crashed into your life and you into mine and this may sound crazy but i m falling in love with you veronica .
well i was also a prize for best director at our final review .
i really wish i could win a lot of fun .
i 've looked for but i did n't realize that our company is very strict .
i think i 'm your lucky fellow .

thanks for coming .

goodbye . see you again sometime .
i am not used to it .
it 's all good . he 's a tall guy and brave .
can you believe that last year ?
well you can bet this relationship is a little tight and a flash .
it 's love at first sight because i know he 's really young .
i know it 's going to be a girlfriend .
i m afraid i have t got one . i may have a small collection of chinese women .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it s just one of those things .
how do you like it ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
what a terrific game !
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
i do n't like drinking coffee .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
well let 's order something else to drink .
i 'm not sure .

yes let 's go .
oh . that 's what i thought .
look at the girls in the street . they all have a bunch of flowers .
do you really enjoy such dangerous sports ?
i m very sorry .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
no . i 'm thinking of taking you to the restroom . can you give me a hand ?
of course not !
i 'll tell you all about me .

ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
he 's got a promotion .
well . you can t have come to work until tomorrow .
no joke !
i like miniskirt .
do you think he is introverted or extroverted ?
oh yes they are the ones that are on sale now .
i think that they must be horrible . one of the neighbors were so scary .
let me see .
i think he s a good boy .
sorry mom i 've got a crush on you .
no i haven t . my birthday just didn t go to a movie .
i ve already voted .
i like almost all kinds of sports .
it 's just a regular exercise . if you want to exercise you can easily get a good price .
me too .
what do you like to enjoy the rest of the family ?
that is the best way to get .
come on . here is the symbol of the year .
i think you should do more exercise .
so what 's it about ?
i wo n't do .
we took a fantastic time .
that s all right . we ll teach you how to play the game .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .

i m not kidding .
and the winner is . . . you 're too lousy to go out and catch a movie .
i will . thanks !
oh yeah . i saw the first person i wanted to take the gun .
oh we just cut into the mouth in the kitchen .
he 's the superintendent of this building .
the same thing is all my words .
that sounds right .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
not really . it was quite an english teacher .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
that 's right . you should know there 's a lot of english about it .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i have been working in the it department of advanced technology . the interest rate is very competitive . most of the items i have been working for a dotcom . i am also mi certified . i 'm looking for a team environment where i can join the excitement of building a company .
well he 's a guess . he 's so upbeat and sweet . oh come on me . oh do n't get that well . maybe he 's just a bit nervous . but if he does n't like me he 's so much trouble . maybe just been a bit nervous .
hmm . . . well i just want to know how it goes . do you have any other ideas ?
oh ! i am sorry . i forgot to book the tickets .
i see that myself .
i 'm finished . you can bring it tomorrow .
how much does it cost ?
well take it easy . i will look for you .
she 's pretty easy to get along with . she listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .
what about the kitchen ?
that 's good . he always seems to study very well . i think we should do something different . what kinds of good work did you think ?
really ? he 's such a nice guy .
that 's why i 'm glad i could get the opportunity to learn something new .
the same to you !
huh ?
i do n't know . i have no idea what to do . i want to make up my own special recipe .
thank you . i 'll try to make a decision . when is your decision ?
i 'd love to . but i 'm not myself today .
yes i 'd be glad to help you .
she is .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
what 's your favorite occupation ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
yes i think they 're playing games .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
how much do you have ?
i 've never heard about it .
really ? that 's wonderful . they have been together for years .
merry christmas to you !
i am glad you are satisfied with your performance .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
i think the important thing is that all of them are not very important . you should do some things about your size . the only thing for you can read and show the story as a gift .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
it 's gone with the wind .
what kinds of books do you like to read ?
first of all you need to do is make sure that you get what you want to eat .
i guess it 's easier to say something about that .
i believe this is going to be the last minute .
what do you mean that we can train that bus to stop ?
the skin of <unk> is 1500 meters . but it also added a <unk> the air .
i think it s a great idea .
really ? i want to go too .
i think i 'll take two .
what a pity !
no i think harry will get the films .
you want to watch them ?
and i heard that he had a great ear for himself .
i do n't think so . the air here is much more polluted than the road .
that 's the case .
i think so . it has to be divided into two parts . the owner of the windows of the air here .
no but i think it 's still december .
ok thank you .
i am not convinced by your explanation .
i do n't know about that . he is also an excellent speaker .
that is true . i have to stay at home and watch my cakes .
but it is and that s why many people prefer to have black babies !
no wonder people never seem to like that . they do n't have to control anything .
is there anything i can do for you ?
i have no idea what you 're talking about .
what a pity !
you know that i have seen her in the first year . i was in love with her as you know .
i 'm not sure . i just thought it was going to be a surprise .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
yes . our guest team is really tough .
they 're still fighting hard . let 's wait and see .
that 's right . but i am leaving from taiwan .

hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?
my name is sam .
what do you do ?
ping . ping . ping .
what do you do ?
i 'm from new orleans . what about you ?
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i once played the night before i was a little disappointed .
a growing keepfit fever is sweeping over china .
yes . it was four years ago .

i think so too .
oh i see .
i think he 's just a neat freak . i do n't know how to face him .
what is he like ?
alright . that 's a good idea . when we hear the young man we were supposed to have a conversation to all the time .
what ? he 's the only thing i can do .
see you later .
neither . the game ended in two all .
thank you .
china beat brazil 3 to 0 .
there 's a doubt that there is social her father who wants to take the children .

do n't worry . i do n't want to be late .
exactly . you 're going to wear one to a new one .
yeah . but bob 's talent ca n't to be named on the same day with carl 's .
he is not young as he looks . i think he 's almost sixty .

thank you .
the same to you . but you must take the test .
what time do i need to make an appointment for ?
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i came two years ago .
i think a bunch of people will be out of the company and complete it .
she 's pretty easy to get along with . she listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .
what is her strongest trait ?
well since it is n't . so you will have to wait at the next stop and bus station .

sorry we had a crush on you .
i think we have a very good nose .

it must be strange for you to live in taiwan .
it is . it was birdseed . we do n't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that we can t be able to come down for any more .
sorry . but we ca n't take any chances .
i went to the library and lost my bag .

what 's the matter ?
what 's it ?
i went to the library and lost my bag .

20 per square yard .
how much is the rents ?
i am not sure about that .
we already have a loan .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
what about your sister ?
what 's the difference ?
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
i 've heard a nine bus in the suburbs . it 's not as bad as a guest . . . .
where are you from now ?
i can get an interview with a few newspapers for my future . do you have the interview ?
who won ?
that 's why i did n't show you to the truth .

i love rumba and waltz .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i 'd like to but i ca n't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the area .
no not at all . i do n't think i like your foxtrot and tango .
yes let 's go into the dancehall and ask if we can take dancinglessons .
well i guess i can do that .
well i think that a lot of people are pleased with that .
not really . they are not used to study for their sake . but that is a great national holiday .
is n't that the place ?
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for the general the purpose of the day is generally quite <unk> savor the wine .
that 's great .
they 're of the older kids .
i 'm glad to hear that . by the way is the case of the changes of this earth 's image to refuse any of the earth ?
it 's very cold there .
yes it helps me to relax .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . th

what kind of power struggles are you talking about ?
yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 pm this thursday afternoon . please come on time .
that s a good idea . thanks .
let 's watch the canadian team . they have a good manager and a great coach .
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics
i would like to take a look at the may .
it s the same in the city . we have a lot of difficulties in this city . there s no chance of view from this balcony .
why ?
yes especially in spring .
i like spring .
i know . i 'm going to the winter .
i always like to go out for a walk before a supper .
i like summer especially the summer .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
we still have to drive to the park .
really .
it looks very good .
yes . it 's not like this . why do n't we go for a walk ?
yes i am .
why ?
i 'm sorry .
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
not at all .
i m afraid i have n't got one in this city .
it was a pleasure .
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
sure what is it ?
i 'd like to change these dollars into rib . would you please tell me the exchange rate between american dollar and rib ?

see you .
yes do you like it ?
yes i do . it s very interesting . what s your job ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
it 's such a matter of fact that 's why i 'm sure it 's nothing serious .
it 's too small for me to wear .
you can get it fixed .
it must have been a few years ago now .
how time flies !
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
it 's much too hard for me to explain . i 'm just trying to give you a definite answer .
anything else ?
yes . we 're out of milk .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it 's not that i 'm going to be able to give me a credit .
sure i know . but on the other hand i am going to give you a ride .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with it ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so .
you are welcome .
you 're welcome .
we 'll try our best .
nothing . i am just a bit tired .
did he say that ?
yes he is .
why do you say that ?
because the earth 's environment ca n't tolerate cars forever . i think cars are already causing global warming . when the problem gets more serious world governments will have to start limiting car use .
it s a pity that i cannot take a long time .
then what 's the difference between having a crush and a crush ?
oh i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a fever .
what about your mother ? do you think so ?
this friday evening ?
what 's the available time ?
i 'd love to . what did you do in mind ?
oh that s the one . they re holding a name of stories .
i usually go on a holiday to get my food .
i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
i m glad to hear that .
it 's my pleasure .
i really wanted to watch the star wars on the opening day but the presale tickets were sold out . how did you manage to get hold of them ?
you re welcome . goodbye .
i 'll pick you up at six .
no problem at all .
<unk> with both night and time .
i know . but it s just that you are right . . .
i do n't think so .
perhaps you can ask her out for a date .
my friends and i are able to help you home . i can t stand your car in the garage with the heater . that should be more convenient .
i 'd love to see the famous dragon boat race . how is it ?
ok . i 'll look for it .
well you 're right . i think i had a good dream to have a child .
well . do you prefer working with others or the teachers ?
i think that it is a very quick way to find a job .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . but i do n't think they are lazy .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and you 'd take some exercise every day .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . i was elected excellent party member for four academic years .
you should be in the post office .
yes . i recommend you to read through the book .
i am not sure .
do you think these girls are a good cure for a guy ?
do you feel tired ?
of course . i only had my fashion magazine in a library .
it 's a hard question . it 's about time for me to get to the city centre . there is some strange reason for you .
very interesting . so it must be very emotional .
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
well they 're on special offer today .
i 've got it .
but i am going to work for a regular lunch . it 's always nice to do things with a friend .
but i want to be 12
then what should i do with the add ?
what are you talking about ? we always eat the stuff here .
great i ll take the train .
yes you are right .
and the expiry date ?
i do n't want to see a movie by myself .
you 're quit ?
no . the road is actually quite small . you have to turn on the handle with the heater . that 's why i 'm looking for some reason .
not really . i was just thinking of buying this one .
i have no idea .
i know . those two boys were good at roses so i really do n't know what they 're going to get .
sure . you can go to the public 's house .
oh gosh ! i ca n't bear it anymore !
just that in the states get on the bottom of the paper .
yes that is true . i was just wondering if there was a coffee party that i could have your name and credit card .
i don t know . i just like the big star wars on the internet so i m not sure how to get used to it .
sure . i ll be glad to .
wait a minute . i think we have a good rest .
at 8
july 20 ?
but i have an appointment with my boss this morning .
thanks a billion .
well could you pick up some sugar ?
fine .
she is in a coma .
i 'm sorry about that . it 's not allowed to take any kind of cold weather .
about fifteen years .
i remember when she moved there .
she went to the public park in <unk> near us .
not much .
did you enjoy your stay ?
yes i have a parttime job as a clerk in a store .
i got the message . i 'm quiting .
i do n't know maybe one hundred .
after all the trouble does n't she ?
they are fashionable you know .
can you tell me why you want to quit ?
they are 168 .
can you tell me why you want to quit ?
yes they re very fashionable you see .
what s your present permanent address ?
it s a skill .
really ? that 's nice .
that 's right . then you have to fill out this form .
it sounds very emotional .
what are you going to do ?
it s really very nice .
why ?
thanks a lot .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .
how old is he now ?
he is in his late thirties .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's checking bags . he s an official in the customs .
he has a hero on the eighteen .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the <unk> young man .
you mean i have to do it ?
and when do you leave ?
shall i try it on ?
i 'd love to . but i 'm not myself today .
i guess so . she is really pretty cute and brave . do you have any other questions ?
so we can get down to the city centre .
oh i see . but you know you always pay more attention to your diet .
well it s true . but i m not sure .
yes .
sure . i d love to .
no i have n't .
why did you quit your last job ?
oh my computer crashed again !
i think he is being a good singer . you know he is also a good student .
oh it 's really nice . where did you stay ?
that s very kind of you .
so i am thinking of traveling for a new year 's vacation .
why not ?
that 's great news . what did you do for a living ?
he does n't need any help . his car is always on the road .
yeah . anyway i 'm not sure .
no i did n't . and you ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
what do you mean ?
i do n't have the slightest idea .
i just ca n't forget to answer my question .
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's the band ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
yes i can . i can write it down .
what position did you transfer from ?
well standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . express is the fastest but it 's also the most expensive . it only takes three days and you can track your package online .
do you play table tennis ?
what 's he like ?
he 's really good looking .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall .
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
ok .
i 've already given you a discount of 20 . if i do n't accept the discount i 'll give you a discount .
i feel terrible i really stupid .
it 's interesting .
em it 's delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
i 'm going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
i am going to camp . i have to put a few books on the first floor .
and maybe it 's a long way to go with my friends .
would you like a shave ?
sure . i 'd love to .
as soon as i have to leave . i will be there on time .
ok . i 'll be expecting you .
i 'd love to but i do n't know the festival is a little popular especially for the festival .
you should 've just gotten a little more rest .
yes i have . what s up ?
well we have a lot of options . but you are the most suitable person for me .
i 'll keep that in mind .
yes it is .
i am not in the mood for dancing actually . you know what ? i just feel like staying home tonight and <unk> after all .
it 's not only a chance to try it .
i also want to pick out a dozen eggs and a dozen sausages for my aunt .
yes it is .
what do you mean by our company ?
i am doing well and you ? how about you mary ? how are you ?
sure . i 'd love to .
yeah that 's a good idea .
yes . i think it 's a great idea .
sure . i live on a chair of this town .
no problem .
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
no i 'm full .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
i do n't believe it .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
i have to work this tuesday .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
how many children do you have ?
hi malia would be able to help us choose a sweater .
i ll pick you up at eight o 'clock .
i have lived here for twenty years .
can you speak any other languages ?
may i know your particular name ?
how many pieces of cake do you want ?
thanks you are such a good cook .
all right . i 'll have a glass of water .
i 've been away on a vacation .
i know . it 's really a long time .
since last weekend i went to see it we had n't been here for a long time .
so what do you think of it ?
i just graduated from high school .
what is your major going to be ?
i 'm majoring in english .
when you are sir why you might like to work for our company ?
i have been told that i 'm the right person for the job .
hi george . i hope you 're doing well .
i am glad to hear it .
i hope everything will be smooth .
yes . i graduated this past june .
and i 'm glad to meet you too .
just fine and you ?
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yes . are you kidding ?
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
how long does it take ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
it 's beautiful . enjoy it while it lasts . it 's supposed to get cold tomorrow .
i love it when it rains . are you going to have a picnic ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
yeah this spot here is the high season .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
let 's just hope it does n't get hotter .
i had a lot of nerve telling us that everything is high .
really ? but i m so glad for them .
whatever . have a drink of water .
she 's fine .
why do you say so ?
tom that lucky guy .
he s been on a business trip for the last two years . we arrived each year and i m sure he s got a job that pays off .
how terrible !
he 's much better than me .
she s been a bit nervous . i just want to give her some suggestions .
he 's been late for work twice .
oh that 's a great uncle .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
you can say that again . he is always so naughty .
no wonder you never know how to control his temper .
are you aware that you ran through that stop sign ?
i know what you mean .
well the child has she 's doing great job .
you bet .
i think you know maybe she is just a neat freak .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know but i just had a bad dream last night . i really did n't mean to put a face at all .
i do n't know . i just feel a little dizzy .
thanks for your help .
it s all right . that s when we are in the opposite direction .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said it 's a lovely day . why do n't we go for a walk ?
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he saw my jobseeking information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
if you could say it again .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i think he 's very serious .
how can you be so sure ?
he knows a lot about law and he s eloquent too .
never believe his words .
no i do n't think so .
i think so . and i get along very well with them .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right . he sure is .
really ? who was that ?
you 're kidding !
thank you .
but i doubt if i can speak english in chinese .
he has the boxes mean anything .
yes please . here it is .
mom and dad ?
don t worry i can handle it . it s probably of the stress you ve been under . just take these stairs down .
here is the room . the room is number <unk> . would you mind giving me the room ?
i am on a diet . and i do more exercise regularly .
but you two used to be so huge .
i think it s because of the bad weather .
i mean we chinese think differently from the americans and the americans may not be good but they are just too expensive .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
she 's going to be pleased with that . and there 's no problem at the moment .
yeah the more people need to think that it is because that they think that they are better than this subject .
maybe you are right . well you should talk with him and let him make his own decision .
well we have a lot of difficulties in many ways . but since we were married i think you should have a house to match each other and do it .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
i appreciate you telling me .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell me about it .
really ? how do you like it ?
well it 's true . it can be a lot of fun .
i will try to ! they can just do it christmas .
it must be kate .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
oh my ! he must have known you . do you want to do something else ?
no i don t .
i like you . i like girls who are more independent .
i think so . it 's a lovely girl .
well you can just bring yourself some fruits and vegetables and vegetables .
i am happy that you have a good journey .
i 'm sure you will love her .
i think so .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
thank you .
could n't be better .
really ? where did you go ?
eighteen .
do you have a family reunion ?
that s a big family . how old is your brother ?
it sure is . but if you had to wait for the next test i would probably put on a physical exam .
i see . a lot of people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months .
i m not sure .
what s your present permanent address ?
yes a lot . i get a lot of them .
oh come on ! i 'm not his mother . you two are always a good friend .
thank you .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum i was hoping you d like to come with me .
i am afraid i ca n't i am going to be out all day .
what about sunday ?
i wish i could but it 's my mums birthday .
maybe next week .
i 'll be there .
sorry to hear that i was really looking forward to spending some more time with you i really enjoyed our last chat .
i am really sorry too maybe i can give you a call sometime .
nothing special .
well i have to take a guess .
that sounds great .
about three .
do you need help setting up or anything ? i do n't mind . i like to do that kind of thing . it 's fun and i have a good eye for decorating .
no . thank you . i can handle it but thanks for the offer .
ok i will see you then .
ok . bye .
he is still single .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
i love how happy they are !
what 's the matter ?
i really do n't know .
she is expecting .
how do you know ? your mom is a little different .
yes . he s very good at this o 'clock .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that 's great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .
ok . where shall we meet ?
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
do n't worry i will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty .
i 'll be waiting .
is the doctor ?
you are kidding .
what does she look like ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
take it easy .
thanks a lot
i think that unfortunately it s just a natural world .
i know . i have been going to the same school as the first day of all .
my husband is an american . he criticizes me when i do that . i remember that i can t change a child s behavior by using force . he is learning what i am doing now .
you have a point .
of course you can .
well i have to clean up my diet . and in my spare time i got a good job .
well . you should have stayed in bed for 6 days .
i can t believe it ! don t worry . we ll get there before the library closes .
she still loves him .
because he 's supposed to be my date .
i think that many people believe that they are well different from smoking .
just because of the low salaries .
oh hi . i m sorry to hear that . have you been there before ?
i have to work this tuesday .
when did you take your temperature ?
i hope so . thank you for your delicious meal .
yes we are . what did you need ?
how many nights a week is it ?
we planned our wedding for next may .
how about summer ?
well . . . we ve got a very good location in the downtown area .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
what do you suggest i should see in new york ?
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i 'll be able to tomorrow .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
she 's very nice .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i went to a movie with a friend of mine .
that 's a long way to go .
yes it 's a really nice neighborhood .
good idea .
i 'm fine ! how are you doing ?
i 'm fine too thank you .
where are you from sam ?
with the greatest pleasure ! where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the central music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
yes may i help you ?
yes i 'm looking for a house .
yes .
i got the message . i 'm quiting .
nice to meet you john .
nice to meet you too .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
good luck with your life .
it 's just what i wanted .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
i 'm glad you 're happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
here is the fare and keep the change please .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
no problem .
it 's quite a big problem just for me to get my sleep .
that 's great . i 'd like to go .
it was about a married couple .
you bet . i had a lot of space there .
yes . may i ask who 's calling ?
i m calling to offer you the position of computer engineer .
wow ! what a lovely child ! it s just what i m looking for .
terrible .
sure mike i d love to .
how about at 330 ?
good evening david .
good evening . my wife and i would like a room please . is there any room available ? we do n't have a reservation .
i do n't think so .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
yeah . what 's your parents doing ?
oh thank you .
how do you do ?
hi steven . i want to speak to linda .
i 'm fine thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it 's hard to keep track of everything around here .
pretty good . what brings you here ?
that s a pity . i ll be glad to meet you .
i can tell you what kind of meat i want .
thank you for the invitation .
that s a great idea . i m really sorry .
i have really bad poison oak and can t stop itching .
i can t believe i m going to .
yes . i have been working for a long time .
you 're under arrest for concealing illegal drugs .
i see . we are looking for a good deal of getting a new <unk> and we can look at the credit .
yeah . why not ?
no .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
we 've already done that before . why do n't you go to the theater and i 'll go to the parent 's house . they 'll go to pick you up at the end of the month .
i see . what about the commission ?
no you do n't . it 's enough of the service .
i also heard that the customer service was a problem . they said that the goods are well paid .
there is some paperwork but most of the time we put the information into it .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
my house is next to the place . i think i can help you find a place that 's already furnished .
i have a little older than you .
yeah . you 're a good cook .
it 's just a slogan for a health insurance company 's health .
i see . my parents want me to live at home as soon as i can see them in a band .
i have to work on the day day of work . i just want to take it easy . but now i have to watch my calories .
i know i need to learn that myself but i just do n't have the money for it at the moment . living in taiwan is a big school but i do n't want to be a lawyer .
i 've never had one in my life .
i see . please give me some brochures to be ready to get home .
they wanted to go out and so they made me look after my baby brother .
what happened ? did you ever see his parents ?
it 's a traditional family . however our sole agency had a lot of overseas customers say .
sounds interesting .
the main reason i 've seen that is one of the most famous celebrity couple in the world .
i have found i should have a new wardrobe . they also have something more expensive .
wow ! and it 's great that we 're having a child at a federal level . if you remember to give us a ring if you really want to .
how often do you get to meet them ?
i 've got a little bit of gaining in my life . i 'm looking for a new job as a manager .
are you serious ? he is a tough dog .
he is .
so that s great . thank you .
that is what my husband is one of the best . he has a funny personality .
my parents just seem to have some cookies . do you want to go with us ?
that s true . it s a tradition . they sell <unk> like it . but in the morning they get up really sweet and have a big talk to her .
that is quite reasonable .
i used to work as an english teacher .
so you 're chinese to study english ?
ah ! that sounds like a good idea .
well that s true . if you like to join us i ll have to work on it . that s my problem !
she looked sweeter than her pictures .
i 'd be glad to .
ok . why don t you ask me a time holder ?
do they have to do that ?
i am sorry to hear that . but you know it 's time for your career . maybe you should work so hard .
i ve been out of town . i ve been out of town the last few days .
and you should go back to the movies this weekend .
i ve been busy with work . i had to find a parttime job .
when did you get to school ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
well i 've been very busy lately . i guess i ll have to go .
oh that s wonderful .
i have a lot of weight . i like almost all the time .
i d love to but i m not sure . and i d love to get to sleep .
it was no big deal .
yes i have . i have a good dream in a business .
in my opinion you should go to the university every day . the registration fee is thirty yuan .
well i 've lost my grandpa when i was younger . i always get up very early in the morning .
do you like playing table tennis ?
that s the really life .
well i may consider you say that . but how can you stand for a friend in high school ?
did you have to take a medical before you could take out the policy ?
well during the weekend i often go to the cemetery to be my first trip . i always want to go out for a ride .
it is a little far away from the city .
do n't be silly . i 'll take you anywhere else .
you should take a cut .
so you re a <unk> teacher .
no i did n't . i just watched the football match .
my favorite is to play computer games .
right .
what do you mean ?
we re playing against the games .
i see . and who s the director ?
well who all is your favorite singer ?
well . you have n't seen such games have you ?
most people like football . more boys like football than girls .
well i do n't know . but i 'm not much of it .
oh yes . you are a real child .
what do you think of that ?
i know that s true but i m not sure . i just found the right person s going to my own wedding and i m too happy to get along with .
yes i 'm sure you will .
i do n't think so . i think i am a good teacher .
i get too tired ! i ll be too nervous if i get up early .
that s not a bad idea . well you have to go to the movies .
that s true . for example it is a holiday for all the family .
interesting . but i heard other people who play the piano for fun .
some of my friends play cards on the internet . that s why i usually play it as an interpreter . if you re a new student you re doing a lot of swimming in a pot .
well maybe you should . you should go and have a try .
that 's great . i can just enjoy the opera and other oil .
calm down !
yes . it was a long time . i 'm paul .
that 's not all !
i think it 's too much for you .
i do n't know .
i think so .
i 'm not kidding . but it 's for you to be such a wimp !
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
why are you in such a hurry ? i 'm always tired of the night .
yes i know . but i think it 's going to be so fun .
i think you need to do something . maybe you could tell me what the matter is .
hmm . i could n't wait to see that !
your son is a real <unk> . i 'm just worried about how i 'm going to be taking a look at this .
not bad . it seems you are super yogurt lover . you have so many in your cart .
oops . i guess i 've got all the same .
maybe it 's my fault . but you should fix things .
he 's going to be sent to britain to study really ?
i don t know .
i feel terrible i really didn t mean to knock you over . my tire just exploded and i lost control of my bike . really it was an accident . please accept my apologies .
oh i see .
i want justice .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s the anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
i ca n't believe that i was a good boy .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he had better make a change .
what did you do ?
that 's right . maybe it is just an emergency room to see what i should do .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an <unk> .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
do you think i can tell my mom ?
i got it .
what kind of work will you like ?
do you want to take any pictures ?
song you are now the groom 's mother . why do n't you go to the american church ?
what did he do ?
i 'm just glad that you do n't have a child .
i do n't have any tradition . so i have to have a bad effect on my own .
well she was a very good team player and you ll have a lot of experience to be able to support her by the end of the year .
i see .
you know maybe we should do better in the movies .
i suppose so .
i do n't want to argue with you anymore . it s really been a pleasure talking with you .
well i know that . i have to learn the game of all by myself .
what is it ?
i 'm in a good mood today actually . how about you ?
no wonder you always look so active .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
i really do n't like him .
no it was n't . we went there last week .
i 've heard there 's a lot to do about it .
i 'm not sure .
oh china is the very beautiful .
why not ?
i know . i will do it later .
i do n't think so .
mom i do n't think i can stand the car in the aisle .
he 's a bit of a hurry at the moment . we can have a rest at the hotel and we 'll be back at the hotel at the hotel .
yes it is .
it 's 7
yes it is .
oh i see . i have done the same thing as the clerk .
oh is it because of the bad things that i am thinking of ?
yes i do .
but i ca n't see the results .
yes . they are .
let me see . if i 've got a credit card with you i can provide free .
good idea . i want some too .
if you do that the workers won t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs .
yeah i 'm glad to hear that . what do you do after graduation ?
you know i am really behind your head !
yes my friends and i are planning on going to invite you to a party .
oh it 's amazing . i 'm going to try it .
really ? so you just took home a stray cat ?
what time should i arrive ?
i do n't know . i think i know who .
give me a break .
yes .
it 's really not just that he makes a funny sense of humor . his love is always hard to find a guy .
so what ?
that was a good idea !
no not yet . the dustbin is at the back of the school .
i like playing the games . what a pity . i have to stand .
you are welcome .
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
yes . i am very interested in a what you do .
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning mrs smith .
ok . let 's get together and enjoy the rest of the day .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
i 'm sorry but what 's the room rate ?
i know you could be right . but you 'd better tell me what you want to do .
yes i know . some of the <unk> are the latest style . now i have a piece of chocolate in the shop .
no you can have a taxi .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
i 'll stay at your house and have a look at the same time .
well ok i guess you 're right . i 'll tell them how they 're about going to react .
that 's right . i got a lot of them . i 'll be back in a minute .
very good . how much do you like the fine ?
i see . i 'd like to have the chicken <unk> .
i said no !
how about all these other words ?
you can say that .
thank you !
there 's no need to be so frustrated .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
thank you . we have a pleasant stay here .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
do you drink green tea then ?
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
what 's the difference between the two people who are interested in the forties .
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i see . what 's the problem ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
a lucky man !
you are a lucky dog .
i have no idea .
do you have any hobbies ?
you are right . it would be a lot of people .
ok . let me make a list of what we require .
ok . i 'll make sure and get it for you .
i 'd like to .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country .
what about affirmative action ?
no that s not a big date .
it s a good idea to put a radio on .
there are basic physical activities and people who are very smart to stop them .
that 's not the point .
no there are girls who are already very thin .
i also admire him for taking the interview .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
what about cats ?
you are so thoughtful .
when did you lose your job ?
do you have enough money for that ?
it 's such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
i m so sorry . i ll get it .
i know . i ll get them for you now .
oh i 'm afraid i do n't understand . i 'll try them . my friend is very nice .
ok . well would you mind giving me the opportunity and i ll call you all the details of them .
no .
ok see you later .
no i did n't . but they 're bad . they 're bad for someone else .
it costs more than 10 hours .
well i think it 's a little difficult to get a ticket to the city that is n't too difficult for you to get to do so .
i think so . what do you think about the jobs ?
i see . but a law banning cigarettes will do no good .
i 'd like it with the shipping bills .
i agree . i think the government should do better in the country . though the government has a good advertising campaign they should do more .
well you can give them credit though . it s about the offer .
on top of that there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
that s right . i think it s a good idea to find a greener city in the city .
no . why do n't you go outside and i 'll ring the car ?
really ?
no problem ! i hope you have a good relaxation and you will be more careful .
he must be proud of you .
he must be very particular in doing that you did n't have any effort .
what is your opinion ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
he might be allergic to pollen . my niece is allergic to pollen . it seems like she has a cold but in fact it s his allergy .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
it s hard to say . while dogs are more affectionate cats are much easier to take care of .
do you play nba games well ?
it s hard to say .
it s a pity that we can t get there .
yes they are .
that 's unavoidable but think how would you keep up to date without television ?
good idea .
i think playing is the best way for you .
do you like playing piano ?
what s your long term goal ?
that depends .
i 'm not too well ! i haven t been feeling too well .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field of world and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing .
they look all right .
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what kinds of sport do you like best ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars have plenty of films . they only want it to be the same .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i know that . i have an idea that they have it at least a couple of dollars to buy one .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you 're welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
yes it is .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
how much does it cost ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
here you are .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
well i believe that people who <unk> a waiter could be good for them .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
well we used to have a each who is investigating a series of strange murders . i play the part of the world . i remember that we could discuss with him in the future . but we have to confiscate the future .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before i had married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
i said i had been to the doctor the day before .
what did he say ?
he said he saw my jobseeking information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
i do n't think so .
why do n't you speak english ?
of course .
how long have you been feeling here ?
very well . let 's see according to his vaccination record ricky has received his <unk> tetanus and hepatitis b shots . he is 14 months old so he is due for hepatitis a chickenpox and measles shots .
hi clyde . this is my friend wen . she 's visiting from ucla .
well i m a college student . how about you ?
who was listening to you ?
i am studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .
i see . what 's the matter ?
yes .
after five days hard work i 'm surely going to have a small day for a picnic .
ok . i 'll try my best . when do you start work ?
pardon ?
i mean most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
i said i had been to the doctor the day before .
i beg your pardon ?
we still prefer french dressing .
how about make up ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
ok . when ?
studying english would n't give me any satisfaction . it 's hard work .
my invitation ? no i do n't think so .
i have never used an alarm system before .
i have to work this tuesday .
is that right ?
i 've done that .
it 's really very kind of you to say so .
oh sorry . that 's not all .
i took a break . i 'm getting a turned out .
what should i do with the sample ?
yeah i 'm still a <unk> . i get really bored at that time .
i know . i could n't stand eating less .
i do n't always go to the movies .
i 'll make sure and get it to the next one .
we have to find a shelter .
well you could try a <unk> workout schedule . it 's probably of the will be easy to get .
ok . i am a little nervous .
you 're welcome . and if you need any other things please let us know .
that 's fine with me . we 'd like to eat hot food and coffee .
maybe i 'll try it .
where did you buy it ?
it is strange that you have to decide what you are going to do when you leave the company . i 'm too busy to leave .
that 's why i get a lot of stomachaches .
what was the score ?
what 's the matter ?
then there 's a certain difference .
how much would you like to pay ?
first of all you should take some medicine and be able to get dressed up .
wow ! not me ! your cousin is one of the best boards at the school .
it does n't matter . i want to get a little of ours .
no i 'm afraid not .
well i ve been meaning to talk to you about the job i m in a bit of a hurry . how do you think about your family ?
yes i had a wonderful time . thanks for your help .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
did you have a copy of his license ?
and she is thin and pretty .
it it true of my way to cheat on the true .
well thank you . how do you do ?
no that s not true . it s just that we can do something else for her .
we will have a nice evening .
maybe i 'll just get a bowl of cereal .
no i m afraid i ll be too cold .
no i m sorry . i ve been so busy !
have a chicken !
so what are you doing ? take it easy !
what are you talking about ?
hey not everyone i 've already grown up now . i 'm in love with you .
well i have a few questions about your loan .
i 'd like to go out to the movies .
the world cup ! the first match is about ! it s mexico vs . south africa ! it s a really cool game ! it s going to be a really good match !
yes it is . let 's do it .
well i have a feeling that i can t afford a pet .
can i watch the tv now ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes i 'm sure i 've done a lot of house painting in my life . and my mother was very picky . if i got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture she would get furious . so i learned to be very careful .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
yes .
don t worry . he is an acrobat
i have to work this tuesday .
you mean we have to cancel the trip ?
it s a very serious problem . he just has to drive a green light and easy to play .
i m afraid there s too much pollution . i think spiders are horrible . i think are horrible .
well i have been here for three months and i have n't been given a raise so long that i have the same problem .
no . you can do it in the morning .
thank you very much .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too . they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow i didn t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the one ? sure that 's drive .
you can say that again .
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no but i 'd like to check out these books .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
not at all . go ahead .
it 's all right . there is a desk just around the corner .
no sir . the more people have the same thing to do . so we do n't have to use chopsticks .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
what 's that ?
not anymore . now he is busy with work .
what about tomorrow ?
snakes ? i like popular music .
why do you ask me these questions ?
it 's 25 .
that 's great ! i hope we can make it .
yes .
what size do you wear ?
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i just ca n't . i 'm really sorry .
yes and when are you planning to go ?
you are welcome !
for what ?
i guess so . i do n't want to post my legs now .
is it expensive to go ?
i just ca n't bear it that emily made me feel like a baby who always pigs out on junk food .
yes i do . it s hard to find a job .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
how can you describe his job ?
i m not sure of that . i m also not sure .
really ? well what kind of winter is it ?
sounds not bad . you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
it would be good if you started taking public transport system to work .
but it 's very difficult to learn .
ok please do n't worry .
you can give me a brief on the topic . i mean you have the right to write down .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
i want to be far away from the city so i ca n't wait to watch them .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
what kind of books do you like most ?
that 's good .
yes i do . i have a lot of experiences to share . i want to share the well with you .
i 'm going to visit some relatives here for several months .
that 's nice .
it sounds good . sorry to have you there .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon . lucky my application
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
what 's the matter ?
yeah i had a great time . you know i was really sick of this saturday . i didn t want to get out of the city .
me too . but i do n't feel like it tonight .
i did . i guess i won t have to go to the movies .
oh really ?
can we talk about it now ?
no i m not .
are you serious ? he is a tough dog .
he is .
so that s great . thank you .
that is what my husband is one of the best . he has a funny personality .
my parents just seem to have some cookies . do you want to go with us ?
that s true . it s a tradition . they sell <unk> like it . but in the morning they get up really sweet and have a big talk to her .
that is quite reasonable .
i 've never had one in my life .
i see . please give me some brochures to be ready to get home .
they wanted to go out and so they made me look after my baby brother .
what happened ? did you ever see his parents ?
it 's a traditional family . however our sole agency had a lot of overseas customers say .
sounds interesting .
the main reason i 've seen that is one of the most famous celebrity couple in the world .
i have found i should have a new wardrobe . they also have something more expensive .
wow ! and it 's great that we 're having a child at a federal level . if you remember to give us a ring if you really want to .
do n't mention it . it s my pleasure . have you been to one of these large sitdown dinner parties since you got to new haven ?
no i haven t had a chance . this is my first time to have a quiet time .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
what are you doing ? why are you in such a hurry ?
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
the same to you !
i know . stay with me . she then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . first though she had to discover her true cat nature . at the end she had actually murdered the boss who was her husband who was her husband who was her husband
it is ? oh that s nice .
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen .
of course ! how about you ?
after you take my exams i want to have a baby who dressed like that .
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i did n't know .
that s all right .
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well i ll be glad to help you out . my parents always seem to be very careful about going to get together with their parents .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
because he 's supposed to be my date .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
it costs ten cents a copy .
i ve been out of town . i ve been out of town the last few days .
and you should go back to the movies this weekend .
i ve been busy with work . i had to find a parttime job .
when did you get to school ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
well i 've been very busy lately . i guess i ll have to go .
my name is zhang ming . nice to meet you susan .
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .

yes . and i think you 'd better have a look at the menu . do you know what the name of the reservation is ?
no i often go back to my home .
of course i can . it s a secret . did you go for a long time ?
no i love my dog . and i love my dog very much .
well i just thought you liked it . do you know how to introduce them ?
yes i am sorry .
no i do n't . i go on a winter holiday instead . i go somewhere warm .
thank you . please fill out this form .
what 's your favorite dance ?
how often do you go to university ?
thanks . that s very nice of you .
i really like that outfit .
good for you !
i have a big date at the gym .
i hate working with people . i think group is a good way to ride .
i used to work as an english teacher .
so you 're chinese to study english ?
ah ! that sounds like a good idea .
well that s true . if you like to join us i ll have to work on it . that s my problem !
she looked sweeter than her pictures .
i 'd be glad to .
ok . why don t you ask me a time holder ?
do they have to do that ?
i am sorry to hear that . but you know it 's time for your career . maybe you should work so hard .
how much is it ? is it enough ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
you re right . we eat a lot of lamb and vegetables .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too much fast food and that food is very fattening .
i do n't know .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
what 's the climate like in your country ?
i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
not yet . i could n't sleep well .
i want to have a walk with the hands .
i 'll finish soon .
she is a nurse .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
oh yes i love it . i think it 's a bit too gross for me .
it 's a thriller .
what 's the difference between the two yuan ?
i have n't even gotten it yet .
it 's a great game .
what do you mean ? he s a liar .
of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
i m sure you ll enjoy the holiday .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there must be something wrong with her .
yes i went to the shanghai school of ohio in america .
oh you re not sure . you probably should be able to get a little heavy .
oh i see . how much is it ?
ok . i 'll get to go . what time should i come ?
it s a big one .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
well it 's just a lot of the things that are difficult to explain . the government is too strict .
that s a great idea . i d love to have a try .
they are fashionable and color .
i don t blame the tv in the past . unfortunately it s not the same as a parent . will you see that the doctor ?
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i 'm pretty good . i haven t been sleeping well .
oh yes i 'm sorry about that . you are n't going to quit my job . well i 'd better take you up somewhere for a few days .
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
me too .
i 'm sorry . i 'm already doing something this friday .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
i 'm a nurse .
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decided that for you yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
do you think it 's a good idea ?
i want to be a backpacker from home .
yes . in fact i am a powerful passenger . it has a very fine <unk> one and a half .
why not ?
i like it very much . it s very nice and exciting .
i know . i 'm going to the night life of the night life .
at 8 o 'clock .
i like summer especially the summer .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well shall i call you again ?
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
why ? we have to drive a car .
that 's a beautiful city .
yeah . it s pretty cold in the summer .
i like the smell too .
really ?
no i 'm not . i 'm just looking for a black one .
so you 're interested in australia .
ah yes . the food was amazing and i bought a lot of beautiful dogs .
i am glad you like it .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
that 's all right .
may i ask you to take a picture with you ?
it s a nice quiet in the woods .
why ?
can you come in for a few minutes ?
i m afraid i will be too busy .
what would you like to do ?
i appreciate that .
do n't mention it .
the same to you !
are you doing anything special ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
that s a good idea . we can go to the park in the country .
thanks . you too .
have you forgotten the cheers ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . can i help you ?
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i can t do without any sense of personal information .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
i think it s my ankle .
what happened ?
i went to the library and lost my bag .
that 's too bad .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
i 'm sorry . i did n't catch what i ordered .
it certainly is .
what was the score ?
yeah . she is almost ready to make a fuss .
you 're right . he sure is .
well he is thinking of doing something else for him .
but that 's true . she would have been very disappointed if i hadn t got them .
i suspect it 's unavoidable .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
can you print it out before 12 o 'clock ? i have a seat .
it 's true . you know he has gone to the game on business day .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no . but i do n't think you can say that again . this company has been a very busy day .
i wo n't .
i 'd be glad to .
you re kidding .
no what ?
what does she look like ?
how about some women ?
oh you re right .
no but i did n't .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i 'm going to try to call you when the computer gets back .
do you know who that will be ?
well it s true . just a little . . .
yes . how do you wish to settle your account sir ?
oh david ! i thought you were in paris .
nothing really .
well that 's life .
i think someone is stalking me .
i do n't know . i just think the blue sky is terrific .
yes . you ve got a very big face .
how come ?
i just ca n't understand . it 's all my fault .
nobody was acting up with a bell .

i m not kidding . i think i had a bad cold .
because he 's supposed to be my date .
a little of both but the time of course a woman had a baby record of him was a bit weak .
yes . good for you .
ok . my mother likes you and i think it 's perfect for you .
that sounds great !
i am not . i just want to have a talk with her .
they are good but i still need a holiday .
what else should i do ?
what kinds of things are you in need of of help ?
you mean he is <unk> and fast .
i do n't know . i just hope the teacher can recover soon .
you 're kidding . cars are not allowed to use public transportation .
thank you for your kindness . we look forward to your reply .
yes . that s right .
no no i would n't worry about you .
i think i 'm going to get some exercise for my mother .
do you think i am your dream will come true ?
yes i 've read it but i 've never seen one before .
good . you are interested in our company .
maybe it 's just that she 's so happy for us .
well you are a little serious . but you made a move on to him like you .
i 'm not sure if i can think of a word .
that s great ! can you do it tomorrow ?
thank you mr . smith .

thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
i 'm glad you 're here .
what do you mean ?
sure .
no but it 's a long time .
i think that all these games are difficult to learn .
i 've heard that . why do you think that we can become a planet anymore ?
you are a quick learner .
i have been looking forward to it for a while .
what kind of food do you want to get ?
i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
maybe it 's not a good idea . but we have no choice for a while .
i do . i like playing the piano .
i know . it 's a mix of all the latest songs .
i like the old style .
yes . i have to work overtime at eight .
what do you mean by that ?
oh peter . you really should go and play ball yourself rather than watching games .
no he has n't taken his temperature .
what 's wrong ?
that 's too bad . to control is really using common sense when you plan to control your eating habits .
good idea . i will take the racket .
how ?
sure .
here you are .
what 's the problem ?
why not ?
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
great ! the ref is on the line . i don t think we ll go down for the play .
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like .
ok . see you at school tomorrow .
sure . any time .
you 're right . he s terribly sorry .
i might need some tools though . do you know where i can get some ?
what a pity !
what s the score ?
i got the message . i 'm quiting .
good luck .
yes i think so too .
i sure do .
the meeting really didn t go down well . i guess i ll have to ask him .
he did n't mean to . his daughter went shopping with him .
he said that the police in your pocket did n't he ?
are you kidding ? you are so naughty .
what do you mean by that ?
exactly . instead i use the bus system i feel bad about how much it cost .
of course not .
never ?
do you have any medicine for the doctor ?
what kind of soup would you like ?
yes .
i appreciate you saying that .
you 're right . it 's completely different . what if he 's got a fever ?
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
see you then .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i m not too clear on some things about my lease .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you .
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to gambling for the social interaction . underage gamblers often start gambling on
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
no problem ! what are you doing ?
i am going to quit the job and i m very sorry .
so what s the problem ?
good . now we can buy the tickets in the library .
so are you !
thank you for saying that .
ok i see . you mean you like the pattern but you re too curly to go in a really heavy wind .
yeah it 's a good question . but . . well you know i have to get it fixed last month .
sure ! are you okay ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i m a good man and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
we don t expect any big deal but our contract is a little higher .
when do you find out ?
honey seriously it s just a sheep . relax ! relax that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable .
what a beautiful home !
i don t know what you mean . i m not really worried about it !
that s all right . i m sure you ll enjoy it .
yes we do . but we have been friends for six months . do you know what i mean ?
i know ! he s really good at backstroke and free style .
that s my pleasure . what do you think ?
do you think that i should go with you ?
i am glad you like it .
i am not used to be like this ! i just can t stand my breath ! my friend is burning into it to me !
it must be very clear and easy to keep in mind .
yeah most of the time it was fun .
sorry i m not on that . it had a very good time .
so what ? i thought you said just now !
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm absolutely full .
i 'll make sure we can go to the mall . can you want to go ?
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea ?
coffee please .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
no . why do n't you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i went to the library and lost my bag .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . maybe she is all right .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i m not sure . i m still going to sit at the bathroom .
no it s not your fault . . .
i m so happy for you !
come on ! what are you talking about ? why didn t you tell me what you were with me ? what happened ?
that s great . i d love to go and play again .
wow you really went through a lot of hard work for me .
you look pretty particular in your neck .
dad ! i m gonna catch a cold .
no not that much .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !

and that 's it . you 're done .
oh i can t write it anymore .
i love that dish as well . it is coconut chicken with rice .
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores

he is a famous american musician .
no i do n't think so . i 'll like it very much .
it was n't too bad . i told that i 'm on a diet .
i think you 're the right person for the swim .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes i do . here you are .
fortunately for you you you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .

would you like to have lunch with me ? i 'm going to the head of the family .
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
i think so .
how long does it take ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
i see . i 'll do my best .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
do you think the same thing in america ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
good morning pete .
hey ! what is it ?
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yes i should know that . it was the least i can do .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
we went to a movie theater in an hour and had a great time .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no i have n't .
so what did you do ?
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm ok .
just get over here ! come in ! quickly !
yes i have . i like several kinds of books .
what about your lips ? it 's so different to me .
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
well you do n't have to worry about it .
no wonder it could have some difficulty .
it 's not just for the first round of all .
definitely .
who was married ?
i 'm afraid we have to cancel it .
yes . it seems we have to make sure their marriage is much better than the same .
it 's not just a surprise .
do people get along with each other ?
how did you do ? you don t have to do that .
i 'd love to . what 's on ?
then let 's go in .
all right .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but he 's definitely the most strong team here .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it .
even though you are making mistakes you must take the marketing course .
really ? even for such an excellent one ?
i have to work this tuesday .
i see . but people are trying to find a parttime job as a waitress or something else to do most of the things they want to do .
that 's a good point . you should have a try .
i do n't know . a lot of people in the same events in china are usually quiet . but i think it 's much more fun than the others .
what is your favorite flower ?
may i say that you are right ?
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
well . i do n't think i can ask her .
she 's my cousin in my company .
i see . that 's why he has n't sent your cv to anyone yet . and i have to say i have a bad chance to though .
do people get married ?
but i doubt if i can speak english in chinese .
he has the boxes mean anything .
yes please . here it is .
mom and dad ?
don t worry i can handle it . it s probably of the stress you ve been under . just take these stairs down .
here is the room . the room is number <unk> . would you mind giving me the room ?
i am on a diet . and i do more exercise regularly .
but you two used to be so huge .
i think it s because of the bad weather .
i mean we chinese think differently from the americans and the americans may not be good but they are just too expensive .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
she 's going to be pleased with that . and there 's no problem at the moment .
yeah the more people need to think that it is because that they think that they are better than this subject .
does he have to do something about it ?
well we have a lot of difficulties in many ways . but since we were married i think you should have a house to match each other and do it .
yes you 'll need to pay for it . i think you 'll be able to do more than your flat .
the one with the special effects are quite different from the menu . i 'd like a soup for a while .
ok . i 'll make a list of them for you .
there will be a front desk and you can tell me how to do it .
it is . you can get a lot of people from there .
will you have to pay for the camera ?
i see . that s probably a good idea . and if we do something you can do about it in the morning .
it 's a letter from ray and sue in shanghai !
well i have tea at home .
it 's an english song . you can get it from the menu . just hold it !
it sounds good . you 're absolutely delicious .
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
i think i have hot climate . i love sand my dream .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
not really . the air here is a lot of meters . there are mountains over there .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
easy .
i think something must be done .
certainly .
i do n't think i can afford that . and i do n't want to take a look at them .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
i wonder how long this weather can last .
you are really a good citizen .
you 're right .
i 'd like to know more about the city .
not really . they can enjoy themselves .
no i do n't think so .
yes i like . but if i have to go to the supermarket now i will have to wait for you .
it depends on what you want . do you like it ?
i am going to the hospital to see susan .
so what 's the problem ?
i 'll call you back in a few days .
i especially liked the night air .
of course . it 's a good way to see .
i see .
no i just want to see if you can give me a second thought . how about you ?
why are you in such a hurry ? you 're always so good at your feet .
i am going to england by flight b . e . 987 .
yeah . it 's nice to see you again .
that 's good . we can arrange it for you . then we can get a loan from our bank .
i 'd be happy to write you a letter of recommendation .
yes that 's true .
well i 'm sure you can do it well . we have a lot of business with people . would you like to help you with something ?
do you have any homework today ?
yes i 'm supposed to . i 'm going to travel to the national holiday soon .
ok let 's play it together .
i know . kind of games do you like to play ?
well do n't worry about it . most of the time we provide free gifts .
now watch . are you playing the chess ?
yes i like collecting antiques .
i was so happy that you took the test .
really ? who won ?
it was a little sick lately .
no i do n't feel like it .
do n't worry about your experience .
well i feel that i 've got to go home and see how to get better .
do you have a big promise ?
you should check the schedule .
where did the breakin happen ?
i 'm sorry sir but i 'll have to give you a ticket .
it sounds a bit sore .
well i 'm telling you now .
i am sorry sir . i did n't realize you had a delay .
could you pick him out of a lineup ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
it wo n't rain .
i think the saudi arabian will hit the spot today .
i know . i have to go now . if i do n't feel comfortable with it i can play it tomorrow .
just pick something and get the hell out of the bag . i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . .
thank you i 'm glad that you 're so excited .
you 're kidding !
just pick something and get the hell out of here . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this .
not quite if we get too heavily in debt the shares will tend to drop .
it feels all right . but if it were a darker color i 'd like it better . this seems too light for winter . do you think you could get me one ?
in 2002 .
no i have n't . why do you ask ?
that 's a good idea !
of course we will . it 's a <unk> rule . you should try to arrive as soon as possible .
please .
please give me one more chance .
do you bring a bottle of wine with me ?
if we 're lucky we 'll go on one of those girls .
sounds fantastic !
what 's it ?
ok . i think it 's a little tight .
sure . why are you <unk> ?
i love you too .
i 'm doing really well . it makes me feel like i 'm in a hurry .
no . why ?
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
is that right ?
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
if that 's expensive .
it looks so cute . is it a parrot ?
he 's got a promotion .
impossible . my pager is really old . it does n't display messages .
you re in luck !
ok ! i am going to try that out !
fine . what time is it ?
oh that s cool . i don t think it s a lot of fun to be happy .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
no i don t think so .
thank you . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
look next time get yourself some comfy shoes . you re gonna come back again with me aren t you ?
that 's not a good day . well the file is for the meeting . is that right ?
can i mail this letter for you ?
do n't worry . you will be able to get them soon .
i was just there a couple of days ago . you know you should go down there too . they have a lot of stylish clothes on sale .
have you had any unusually stressful situations in your life lately ?
yes i m . i ve been out of town .
but you re in love with my wife .
i didn t have any complaints .
i hope so . i 'm still not sure whether it is going to be angry or not .
you re right . what s your dress code ?
yes . i 'm just glad to be of a teacher .
he must be joking . he seems to be very upset about the holiday .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
next june .
i m really glad to meet you too . my name s thomas brown .
oh you are kidding . you met a girl last year . she s very hot and very well .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well . we ve got everything taken care of already .
it s a pity that i cannot afford it .
until monday or tuesday next week .
that 's good . where are you going ?
i m so happy that i can get a dragon on my back !
yes you are right . we have always dreamed of owning our own home but home .
the palace hotel .
i m sure that it s a good idea to get a married any more .
it s true . we can t judge it by its cover .
i know you 're right . however there 's a lot of traffic jam on the street .
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister .
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
i have been married for three years .
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
ha i ll keep that in mind but don t tell my husband .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
well you 'd better not cry because it s kind of short .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no i haven t had a chance to think of me ! i just love smoking .
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i m getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .
cindy s husband is ron .
how many children do cindy and ron have ?
they have two childrenone son and one daughteras well as one daughterinlaw and one soninlaw .

yes they have three grandchildrenone girl and two boys .

yes she gets along with them quite well .

their family is very similar to cindy and ron s family .
he s 21 . how old is james ?
he 's a year older than me .
how s your father ?
he 's been out of work for a couple of days .
how can he be doing that ?
oh i don t think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
so he wants to have a more active retirement . good idea !
how do you want to spend your old age ?
in the same way probably .
do you know who you 're trying to pull out ?
it was so kind of you .
i 'd like to .

miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .

i see . do you have a fever ?
i do n't know but i feel terrible .

do you think i should lie in bed ?
yes stay in bed and drink a lot of water . your fever will be gone in a day or two .

i understand . by the way how do you feel about china ?

do n't worry . i have to drive to the police station .
not at all . i 'm still a beginner . but i know it 's hard to deal with my boss .
i think it 's a good idea . you should work in the company and learn something new .
yes i 've been thinking about it for a while .
do you have a cell phone in your city ?
sure it is .
that 's a great suggestion for you .
you 'll be able to make sure to exercise every day . if you 're good you can get a good job you can also learn from the internet .
yes i know that . but i must tell him that i 'm working on it .
i will .
that 's a good idea . i ll go get a pair of my things . but i have to go to the library now .
i know . i know .
what about the features of the digital tv ?
i 'm sorry . i 'm already doing something this friday .
i have no idea what you 're talking about .

i 've looked at your prices . i must have a few of our products to meet my needs .
we 've already cut down our price to cost level .
right you 're right . we 'll see you at the moment .
i 'm sure i can help you .
i see . that 's why i did n't show my gratitude to the price . i 'm sure your target price is too much safer .
well i want to get it for a year now . it 's a little expensive for me .
well i hope you can give me a definite answer on the details . we shall make it a little later .
i see . well it 's nothing spectacular but it 's pretty cheap for an apartment in a decent neighborhood . . .

i ve been looking for a job for a few days now .

i had a sandwich in the store .
what do you mean ? i m not sure .
i 'm not sure about that .
for example if your birth date is a time deposit book before maturity .
that 's not an easy point . i think an advertising planner should have a try .
we have a really good reputation for that . which one would you like to ?
ok . you will be responsible for the development of the company and then warrant letter of directors .
we need to think that the principle of coproduction is to expand export trade . it 's a reciprocal business is n't it ?

it 's business to us !
yes i do . what do you think of that ?

maybe so but i 'm not sure about the time .
you 're welcome .
i am an excellent communicator . people trust me and come to me for advice . one afternoon my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . i made the customer a cup of coffee and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .
why do you think you be a good fit or this job ?
i tend to get bored easily and so love to keep myself challenged .
what are you going to do ?
it was a significant project you 've received .
that 's exactly where i was planning to go !
yes i work well under pressure and find it dimly . however i believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines .
have you ever had any experience as a guide before ?
i think the key point is that i have strong team members of the company and make a good working environment .
well what about the salary ?
i stick to my principles and keep to the rules . sometimes they just lack enthusiasm . when i get them involved with something constructive some of them change their attitude later .
i like photography very much . i used to be awarded second prize in a photography contest at our university .
very well . what kind of software do you have ?
i have got a master 's degree and now i meet all the other drivers .
what will you be needing ?
i like photography very much . i used to be awarded second prize in a photography contest at our university .
oh did you study english ?
well i have been working on a variety of projects and jobs in the high tech industry . i m also a great career for a dotcom . i am also interested in a business management position .
yes we have the same feeling .
there are approximately nine hundred people .
very good . i have a few questions about your certificates .
i think i should prepare a good letter from the future training .
where do you work ?
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
our company enjoys a lot of training problems in the future .

what s your job ?
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
what do you think of the dating a stewardess ?
that 's right maybe they 're both very fashionable .
yes . i 've told him that i 'm interested in this position .
do you have any experience in this field ?
do you have any other questions ?
if you lose your job you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . if you live frugally you ll save plenty of money .
it 's really a shame . by the way is it quite expensive to take home ?
fully agree . i do enjoy the convenience though i am still a beginner in using excel . the latest office equipment is more typefunctional . it combines fax machine copy machine copy machine and printer in one . it saves a lot of place one machine instead of three .
yes this machine is even smaller than those before .
when will we get one of those ?
you know our boss always trying to save the last penny . we have to use up the equipment first .
sure .
sure . i 'm looking forward to working with you .
what is the purpose of your visit ?
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .

of course not i appreciate that .
it 's no trouble at all .
i see . what can i do now ?

i am quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
do you have experience in the it field ?
they re keyboard operators . this is michael baker and my wife is jeremy short .

how do you do mr . zhang ?
belknap .

you have to go to the school for a small business trip and take a look at the post office .

i got it . thanks for your call .
i 'm from germany .
do you know this restaurant that is a little expensive ?
yes my birth date is september 22 <unk> .
yes i m a junior and a senior high school student .
how can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ?
i need to improve my english .
where can i find their email address ?
phrases and sentence patterns are also very important . you should know how to use them .
oh i know that . thank you for saying so .
yes i am sure i can .
i m sorry sir . but it 's our policy .
yes you are right sir .
yes . is that so important ?
i 'm pleased to meet you mrs . green . my name is myra . i work in beijing institute of technology . i came here to meet you .
i have been married for three years .
how many people are there in your family ?
five . besides my parents and me there are my brother and sister .
what are the brothers living ?
my husband my motherinlaw my daughter and i .
i see myself in a management position .
good answer miss zhanggood answer ! seriously though are you interested in staying in a stafflevel position or would you hope to move into management someday ?
well i have n't thought much about this . i think it 's too early to tell . what 's the most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . if the company is happy with my work then i think i would like to consider other positions in the company .
i m majoring in french literature .
you have made a good choice . what courses you have had ?
i am in nanjing university .
what degree did you transfer from ?
yes i have . i was in the air a few years ago . it was very interesting to be part of the city .
what did you obtain your degree ?
i like business management and i think it 's very exciting .
do you feel that you have received a good general training ?
yes i have studied in an english training program and a computer training program since i graduated from university . i am currently studying finance at a training school .
do you have any experience in this field ?
i passed college english test band 6 with good skill in listening speaking reading and writing . i have n't got any certificate of computer skills because i do n't think certificates are necessary if what 's needed is merely operating a computer . i think practically to know how to use a computer is more important . and i am quite familiar with microsoft office .
yes i nearly did n't sleep last night .
how come ?
it s too old . and it isn t as specious as i expected .
you should n't work so hard .
i know . i work hard for it but i can t seem to be able to give you more time to enjoy the rest of the year .
what do you mean ?
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
i am studying languages .
what do you think of the literature course .
because i was quite interested in the law school in economics .
we have some catalogues from u . s . universities . you may check in the reference stacks over there .
i have learned some skills about how to deal with clients and how to behave myself as a personnel manager .
what courses have you completed ?
no no i 'm not . i never really like necklace .
what would you think of this job ?
i have no idea .
i studied french .
so it has a history for more than a decade ?
i think my greatest accomplishment has been involved in this field .
what do the most tell them ?
i will send thanks thanks for doing my best .
it 's too small for me .
good morning ! my name is peter smith .
thank you ! i have a lot of time .
nice to meet you too .
well hope you are getting better soon .
ok ! what can you bring me with my routine ? i even have one in the house .
you 're welcome .
he has really got a great voice .
i know . but our company has made an offer for us .
that 's right .
i want my change .
we will give you a raise .
i m paid 2000 .
your decision is to be a little more than we did .
we will try our best .
i was just joking and obama is our new president .
i like your suggestion .
i m pretty happy living there .
that 's great .
you ll be paid a bonus at the end of every year .
that 's all right . i do n't mind working on it .
they are both working hard and friendly .
i know they are just next to the western library .
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
yes i can . i speak it very well .
what do you think of the literature course ?
yes a little .
that 's right .
why do you plan to change your job ?
yes i do . what do you see as the future trends for the industry ?
sure . we provide semiannual bonus a small bonus at the end of the year .
they take care of a lot of things .
so that s when my computer is on the list . i want to know how to apply for a job on the national basis .
are they ears ears at all ?
ok . i 'll pick you up at eight o 'clock .
how long will it take to get rid of this apartment ?
well . everyone in our company has always been very supportive about my future .
yes i do . on a scale of one to 10 what would you say morale was in this company ?
what will you do this right ?
how often do you have lunch ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i speak a little french and japanese .
i suppose you 're right .
i had computer science and i learned some high high high high languages .
yes i know that . but i work in the company is very strict .
do you think you can make yourself understood in english with ease ?
i took a lot of courses such as philosophy logic ethics aesthetics etc .
yes i think so .

i have working knowledge of windows and dos . actually i 'm quite familiar with both java and c programming languages .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
any other certificates ?
i found it a garage sale once .
i try to speak it but i think it 's not too complicated .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one .
what am i going to do ?
i took the same care of myself and i enjoy being done by myself .
in short you should present the best of yourself throughout the interview .
in the long period you should present the best of the position you are applying for .
for the extension of your should be messed up .
gee how dangerous ! i 've almost knocked him down .

it 's the most important thing to me .
yes you have a current job .
i hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . since my major was international banking i really hope to work at a bank .
then why do you want to work for our bank since it 's a new establishment in shanghai ?
because your bank is a new one i think i 'll be given more opportunities and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here .
it certainly is . but the work is also hard here . you need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field .
i expect to work hard madam .
do you mind going on frequent business trips ?
i do n't think so .
we could give you a lift .
i 've been looking forward to visiting your factory .

i got to know your company through such famous brands as lux lipton and walls . after making a customer survey i was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of chinese .
why would you like to work with us ?
it 's an interesting job and your company is one of the best known . although i have no work experience as a salesperson the job description you sent was very interesting . it 's a job i 've been dreaming of when i was at university .
oh really ? would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected ?
i don t think so . as the saying goes a great oak needs deep roots . i m really interested in this job .
that s fine . thanks for coming to see us . i hope to be able to let you know about the job within the week .
do n't blame me for the past week !
well it 's really a big problem . the pay for a decent place is n't it ?
i have a lot of mood in the house . how about you ?
why do n't you go sightseeing ?
i 'd love to . but i 'm not good at it .
how often do you play tennis ?
sure . we should be able to get a lot of information from your city centre and play the piano for free .
well i 'm very glad you like it .
that 's a great goal !
where do you want to go ?
that 's great . thanks .
i know what you mean . that 's why it 's easy to write a simple letter .
i hope so .
of course not . you should try to be one of those .
sure .
i have been doing quite well . as reach 90 and bs reach 100 . and i ve been awarded zu jingle scholarship two times .
did you get any honors or awards at your university ?
because i needed a job in which i wanted to have good career path to get a job like that . then my employment petition is challenging .
i see . why did you choose our company ?
i like doing aerobics in my spare time . it 's good for my health .
because you need a senior production planner who is good at mathematics and fluent in english . i think i am fit for the position .
what is your technical post office hours ?
i love going to the fresh air .
why do you want to quit your present company ?
what 's the matter with you ?
nice to meet you mr . li .
a very good place .
that 's quite a number 13 bus .
twentyone .
here 's your ticket and change .
yes that 's right .
what position did you take there ?
i have been attending a conference in english for 2 years .
oh you came to the right spot . what s you need to learn ?

yes . i do n't want to be stuck in a rut . i want to move on .
have you decided ?
yes . i want to get a better job .
could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
oh that sounds terrible . would you be happier with higher pay here ? i m sure something can be worked out .
i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to have to work with the finance department . they 're supposed to be more open now than we can get start .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
ok .
how much ?
how do you plan to accomplish this ?
if you can give me a free class going around the corner . there is a large number of the people on the street and the street .
please call us as soon as we get home . we 'll make sure that your contract is on the second floor .
i want justice .
can you tell me the price of the order ?
yes .
yes i 've got married in some years . i think the idea of her is very good .
but we have only one chance to get rid of the order .
yes . if your company can get the commission ready by the end of the year .
but if you are asked for your advice you should give us a discount .
we have the same opinion . when you can get it back from us i 'll give you a better price .
i am not sure of that . i know that it 's a sound idea to me . but i 'd like to know the feeling that we can do more about the new products .
there is about 10 000 dollars per year .
what do you need ?
i need to use the internet .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what do you mean ?
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
i think i m very good at speaking in this area .
i see . i think i understand what you mean .
the hard drive has been ringing off the hook .
yes it is . but i am not used to it .
no really ?
yes .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
don t worry . i will call you back later .
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
did you take your temperature ?
some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
it s good to hear ! rest assured that we can not be able to improve our preparation and taking a walk .
you mean the seventy seventh ? it s not far from here . you can walk there .
well i suppose you should apply to our company right ?
have you taken a lot of inquiry to our office ?
why does n't the company run into the ground ?
that 's something i 've never heard of . but if i have no alternative one to share it with someone else 's suggestion .
let me see .
why ?
if they are married i would have invited both of you to growing up with the company .
wow ! this sounds like something i 've had in mind .
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .

well he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .

i am quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself . a friend in need is a friend indeed . so the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
i graduated from peking university .
what was your major at university ?
i majored in english and minored in chinese .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very exciting .
do you know that is a hard working style ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes . i was chosen as one of the top ten prominent youths of beijing
do you have any publications ?
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled english education in high school and it was published in the education magazine .
i can speak french and german .
how well can you speak them ?
no i can only carry on a simple conversation in french .
can you read and write english well ?
i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed <unk> .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .

certainly . and after your internship ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes i see . but you decided to leave them in 2006 right .
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
you have been working as a team for a time for have you ?
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i have a financial report about a half to offer . i m actually in charge of a financial position .

mmm . . . you know he had the very impressive resume but i m not sure he had the right to say anything .
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
yes sir .
how much is the charge ?
all right who should i send them to ?
it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok home or office address ?
office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .
should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
yes it s right .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out of the office so i can t finish it .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
well all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents information and other things .

let 's see . . . there 's mr . chen for the middle of us .
i see . i think it 's worth it . our company 's made a little tight in the price . i think the market is much better than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
yes i have a few questions .
you have to pay me handling it .
well i 'll pay you back tomorrow .
i 'm not sure you will .
oh great . can you show me how to use my key card ?
you can say that again and i think it 's about how much you want to earn more .

yes it 's all yours .
i see . but i 'm not sure if i can get a position to go .
yes what do you need ?
yes i 'm looking for a job as a clerk typist in english .

i can understand that .
of course . which currency would you like to change ?
is it higher than the bus ?
for the bank manager ?
t please .
well standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . express is the fastest but it 's also the most expensive . it only takes three days and you can track your package online .
should i pay for it ?
could you tell me when it will be back ?
ok .
thank you .
here is the money .
oh i do n't have any foreign languages so i wo n't .

please fill out this form .
i want to deposit 1000 .
well we offer a 10 charge for our members .
ok . who else should i pay ?
thank you !
i do n't want to make any changes to my old card .
thank you .
could you reduce the price ?
you 're welcome .
i 'm afraid i have to go now . the plane will take off soon .
ok . that 's all . i think i 'll take it .
really ? that 's much more than i wanted to pay .
ok . here you are .
yes i see .
here is the number . i will call you back as soon as i get home .
i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
if you could make it a <unk> question please we have to ensure that the goods are <unk> and that the packing should be <unk> .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the report the report was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
it sounds very complicated . thanks for your help .
to be frank you 're an expert of it .
the mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags sixty of these bags to a carton . it is stated on the surveyor ? s report that the damage is the case of the packing .
i see .
i see .
i 'm a student .
oh dear .
thank you . i think i will try my best to get them .
what about the quality of the pictures ?
sure . let me see .
i know . but we ca n't accept your words .
this way please .

one last question . is there any minimum for the first deposit ?
as you know i have a substantial quantity . however i don t have much cash to cover my order . what s the quantity rate ?
let 's get a look at the issue . we want to make a few more problems in the next few days .
here is a catalog that is put out every year with locations that meet campus requirements for as .
what about the commission ?
i 'm <unk> . i 'm also a beginner .
i see . but this is our first transaction . i think you can do it in the first two weeks .
i am afraid i have no idea of that . our agents in other areas usually get a 3 to 6 .
in my opinion the present job should be a little less depending on the value of the contracts in the plan .
ok i see . i think they have a bunch of information on the technical support industry .
i 'll be waiting for you .
well this afternoon i have an appointment with mr . wang . sign here please .
i 'm afraid it is our practice so far to insist on payment by l c . we ca n't accept any discount .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
wow that 's a lot of money to get me . i 'm sure they 'll get better .
i 've heard that . when shall we start ?

two thousand would be fine .
here is your bill .
yes . there is one more thing .

good morning .
sure . you can take the bank to get there .
i 'd like to open a current account .

i do .
would you please tell me your name phone number and account number ?
here you are .
it 's rib which is the exchange rate for usd ?
that 's impossible .
i 'm sorry sir . we cannot help you . could you please fill in this registration card ?
i 'm not sure . what 's the rate today ?
well i 'd like to order breakfast for tomorrow coming .
ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest of small changes please .
i m sorry for that . we ll finish it just in time .
thank you .
thanks and you too .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
i ve been busy with work for a long time . glad to see you again . how about you ?
so what would you consider to be the most dear ?
i 'm a nurse .
i 'm going to need some us dollar stamps for the rest of this year .
i 'm not sure . what 's the rate today ?
do you know how to get a card ?
i m not sure .
ok ! i 'll bring that back to you !
yes . i did n't go to bed early .
i 'm proud of you for standing by her . i really think you could make a big difference in her life .
that 's not what i asked for .
i woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day but i was wrong . a twist of fate brought us together . i crashed into your life and you into mine and this may sound crazy but i m falling in love with you veronica .
i know but we re not able to find an appropriate one for our good price .
i just got a message from my sister saying that she 's been in a car accident .
sounds like an interesting question . what did they do ?
are you serious ?
well i don t want to be able to do that on the way the prices we have at the very beginning . though i have a sole agency appointment with my hands and have a good track record .
sure what do you need to do there ?
i 'm having some trouble . how do you use this printer ?
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my schedule is in a meeting with my family .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
all right . i ll get the form for you .
it s my pleasure .
yes . i m calling from westwood and westwood attorneys . i need to make a reservation for mr . alex brent .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .
please input your 6 digit pin code followed by the pound key . thank you . please select an option . thank you . you have selected withdrawal .
yeah i know what i selected . just gimme my money !
calm down ! my mind is not worth it .
no no ! stupid machine what are you doing !
confirmed . thank you for using our bank ! please remove your card from the slot . goodbye !
i want one hundred and fifty yuan .
how much is a room ?
the starting salary is not the same as your present employer .
it can be done by a cif price .
please fill out this form .
how much is it ?
yeah that s a good idea . you re a thief .
your price is rather out of line much higher than we expected . we have to give you a discount of 20 .
