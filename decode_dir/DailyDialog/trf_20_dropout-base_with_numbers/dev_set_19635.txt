yes . i know that . the most popular clothes i have now are the key .
yes . you can find a parttime job in a hotel near here .
perhaps you 're right . maybe you 'll just need a vacation .
i 'll see you there .
i 'm glad that you 're so cute .
sounds good ! i 'll take them .
what 's the problem ?
oh . . . . . . . . . . .

oh i see . then tell me your weaknesses .
oh that 's too bad . do you speak a little slower ?
yes i do . i like the fact that i do n't like it .
what a beautiful view ! the temple is really a great place to live in the western country .
i heard that in the jungle flying world was in the top of the world .
yes . i heard chinese like spanish and i believe in both chinese and spanish .
oh i see .
oh i see . you can see the tea house . it is a very delicious country .
not really . i like watching games .
i do n't like it . i like it very much .
that 's true . we should have more roads built .
yeah i like the sound of the sound of nature .
well it 's a bit stiff . do you think it 's a 16 issue ?
what 's the biggest fun of the winter olympics ?
i like baseball .
do you want to go ?
oh i see . i thought they were just as good as fun as you can .
i see .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
that 's cool .
it 's a tv station .
is there anything interesting ?
yes . there are a lot of them .
i see .
there are a lot of commercials on the tv .
what 's the difference between the regular and the regular kids ?
it 's hard to say . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . i 'll buy the tv and watch tv .
yes . there are other things .
and that s a good idea !
yeah . he deserves it .
he 's the one who saved the company a lot .
how many people are there ?
well you can drink a lot of water then .
thanks a lot .
i love it .
i 'd like to have a double room with double view .
there are plenty of rugby in my country .
what about grapes and water ?
that s right .
it s a good game to sit and watch it with the ball . it makes the ball into the sky .
there are plenty of rugby in my country .
that 's not the only piece of deal .
there are plenty of rugby in my country .
he had a pretty good ear . i think it was too cold .
there are plenty of rugby in my country .
what sports ?
you are so thoughtful .
what s wrong with it ?
what happened ?
it 's such a strange game . how is it going ?
i 'm not going to get sick .
i see . i ll put the plates and cutlery away as i dry them .
oh i see . i 'll have a try .
well you are such a seafood ! i m glad you like them !
no .
i will get them ready for you by sunday morning .
no i did n't .
it 's better for the environment too .
that 's a great place to live in the city . i would like to go to the great wall then .
yes . we need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere .
maybe so . but a law banning cigarettes will do no good .
i want to give it a second thought .
that s true . but what do you think we should do ?
i see . well then you can buy a tv for yourself and some more of those things .
the biggest problem is that most of the water in the mornings are covered with water . the entire package will be fine .
that s true . i find the biggest environment in my country . i believe it or not .
no but i did n't .
i see . you do n't think that 's a good thing to be happy with your food .
you can t take a rest .
i can tell you a secret .
what happened ?
what does he say ?
oh that 's the one . . . well it seems like you have a good head .
what s he doing ?
yes it 's a small world .
what was the problem ?
it was only a few years old .
that 's what i was looking for .
yes it was .
what was the biggest issue ?
yes . i m a bus driver .
so what do you think about it ?
it s hard to say . it s hard to say .
what do you like best ?
it s a very big ball .
oh yeah you re right .
they are .
that 's true . what is your flight number ?
i like playing the violin .
i think so .
i don t often play it regularly .
what ? you mean you listen to me ?
i like the game best .
i 'm fine .
have you been under a lot of stress lately ?
i ve been having a few problems with my blood .
that s no problem . let me see . . . you still have ten days annual leave left is that right ?
i ve been working hard lately .
have you been under a lot of stress lately ?
yes he s been wanting to do that .
i see .
i like horror movies .
i like the fact that they are too independent .
i think you are absolutely right . i will show you the latest fashion .
i m not sure .
you are right . this year has a very exciting story .
well i like the way that the book is very great . i like the color of the country . the plot and the top golfers in the world are short but i love the plot and interesting .
i like the plot . it 's so exciting .
yes . i ve read them a few times .
that s a good idea . you must have seen the old one .
he s a very good player . how did you learn to ?
i agree . he s really a good player . he always likes football .
yes . i bought a new pair .
what kind of pictures are you looking for ?
yes i like it .
what s your name ?
yes i bought two copies .
you mean the computer ?
i think that they must have horrible lives .
that s true . i think it s a good idea to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go .
that s true . i think it s just that they see the top of the publicity for their works and themselves . they want to see each other for their films .
that 's true . i guess it would be difficult to have them . they are just want people to get men to make their own homes .
that s true . i think most people in america have to buy their money . it s just what i m buying for them .
i m not trying to buy the stupid machine . i don t like the pictures . i m going to buy a new camera .
i think you should keep an eye on them . they re very talented people and they can decide how to do their good .
that s why they have everything in america !
thanks .
you 're welcome .
i got it from macy 's .
i guess so .
i 'm glad you like it .

oh they 're on the wall .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
what 's wrong with it ?
thanks .

what 's your last word ?
i mean you could n't give it up !
yes we had a very good time . we had a good time .
i mean you could say that .
i 'm glad you like it .
i think that we should have told our husband that we would live in a car with a garden .
what happened ?
i 'm afraid i have n't got any .
what are you going to do ?
he said he would call me back .
what s your problem ?
he asked me to stay in bed and always gives him a good chance to get a fever .
