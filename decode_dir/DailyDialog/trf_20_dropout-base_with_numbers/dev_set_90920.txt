thanks .
yes we do .
i 'll have a double whiskey on the rocks .
we have french and thousand island .
that sounds great . we 'll take some wine .
well that 's too far . can you make it a little cheaper ?
do you know when it leaves ?
you need to get off on the corner of del mar and hill .
thank you . so much for your information . is the fare book ?
that 's a great idea . i love swimming .
i 'm a good student and i 've never had a good time so i should have a try and do n't want to ride the bus .
you could choose another appetizer for half price to share .

i do n't think that is too expensive .
why do you think that this would be a good move ?
ok . how do you like your suit ?
have you decided what wine you would like ?
i want to see a movie with my friend of mine .
anything else sir ?
it 's delicious .
this one ?
mmm . how much did you pay ?
i was caught in the car .
yes . i bought it at the sale price . it was only 20 percent off the week .
i 'll just go get a dozen .
you know i 'm going to quit my job . i have to finish it up by myself .

i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .

it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
so how about the food ?
that 's right . i think i should have a try .
i 'm in the united states that 's exactly what i am here for .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .

i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .

the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's about a tenminute walk .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .

you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
i can help you with that . what kind of price are you looking for ?
how about oil or spray ?
sure .
how much money do you want to transfer ?

your flight takes off at 8
i 'm really sorry but i will check for you .
i 'll do my best .
yes . your daughter is a wonderful student .
do you think it will work ?
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
i 've never had a mango .
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
i think so . would you like to order now ?
mangoes . what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .

it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .

it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
you will look lovely . did you go to that party ?
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
why do you plan to change your appointment ?
thank you .
hi my sweetheart . it s dad .
yes come in .
thank you . and how much is it ?
yes i 'm from taiwan . what did you do ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
no problem .
see you then .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
12000 a year but you ca n't get visitors to live in .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the center of the city and the
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello !
wow you sound like a perfect plan .
it should be done by my boss . i should have it done this afternoon .
i 'm fine thanks .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
well ! it 's great to see you again .
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
ok ! well i would really use the help . by the way do you know your company ?
thanks for all your help .
do n't you hit it off ?
for two years .
i see .
she 's pretty easy to get along with . she listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .
what is your strongest trait ?
oh no . i mean it 's a little bit silly .
you mean he was a <unk> ?
so ?
thank you .
hmm . . . how many people are there in your party ?
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
no you do n't ! i m going to miss the plane .
what are you doing when i do ?
i can t believe it ! why are you so busy ?
what 's the cause of gas ?
do you want to see it ?
uh i do n't know . why do n't we just check my connections .
i 'll bet you 'll love it . you 're really a big fan of them .
are you serious ?
yes . we have a reservation for three nights .
what size are you looking for ?
i ll take an inch pro . i ll take an inch of the latest book .
what s your camera ?
actually i think the additional courses should be paid in the past twelve months .
sure i do . take a seat please .
thank you .
so how much did you win ?
how about a picnic this afternoon ?
i m sorry . i don t think using any of the camera . i think we should buy one .
this is good . can you make it ?
i don t think that s a lot of money .
what 's the difference between the two ?
i 'm sorry . but i just do n't know where it is .
what ?
are you sure ?
do you think so ?
how was your flight ?
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
yes . there is one more thing .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll speak to bob he 'll be able to help us .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
we want to look at some of your products .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes .
no way ! i m gonna catch a cold !
it s impressive . if it don t turn on the right line at the bottom i ll show you how to use the swimming pool .
the carpet needs to be cleaned and i could n't stand it . it was so hot !
good news !
it is a little more expensive sir .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
what size are you ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's no hot water after 10 at night . sometimes i like to have a hot shower before bed . especially in the winter . it feels good .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
the kitchen and the bathroom plumbing are messed up .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
i d like to get a lot of information before i could get a few things .
i have n't thought of that .
yes it 's very nice .
would you like to order anything else ?
the ad says 325 plus deposit .
that s way too much .
what account do you want to order ?
what are you going to do with it ?
let me see . that s no problem .
how much would you like to transfer ?
would you please reconsider ?
thanks for asking me .
i m not going to be able to do this .
yes i do it a lot . but i do n't like doing dishes . what about you do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yes . i find most of the older people at home so i for fun . it s no problem for me to buy clothes at an expensive price .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
are you sure ?
i 'll just get some special gift for my new girlfriend .
i am on the top floor . i need a few single room on the fifth floor . could you come back in the morning ?
you have children now .
you should know about the dress .
well i m really tired . i don t want to lose all the rest of my life .
i m afraid that i have to get more than a year s . because it s my size and this year .
they 're fine . i 'll take them . what 's the price of this ?
how long would you like to pay ?
i would prefer a formal dress .
thank you . i think you ll be able to find the perfect sweater in this area .
do n't mention it . you re welcome .
speaking .
i was wondering if i could ask you some questions about the job ?
yes it 's still available . do you want to see it ?
i am happy to have a home with a view of the lake .
i will be glad to hear it . we can look at the furniture in it .
good . i will see you then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
there 's a supermarket at the corner of the hotel .
you 're welcome .
thank you .
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
well . i do n't know . i 'm sure it 's nothing serious .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it is .
right this is a very nice place to go down the street .
really .
with so few windows how can you even see what the problems are ?
well i have a few windows that can be found a little too small .
it looks good .
the best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom .
i 'm sure the quality is very reasonable .
three . they are small and safe .
you could always bring it back to me . the day after tomorrow is coming .
now it looks like it s going to rain .
in what way it is .
which antivirus program would you say ?
it 's great . i can help you pack the bags in the living room and put a jacket .
wow ! this place is so beautiful ! please remember the garden when we first came .
i thought it might be a great idea to get a good idea to the beach in the better condition .
thank you .
that s the color .
speaking .
hello i am calling to inform you that we 're happy to have you with us . welcome aboard i 'm sure your friend would have given you a lot of information of our school and its motto ways of teaching etc .
do you have to pay an apartment ?
maybe you can think of it .
how about tomorrow ?
i appreciate it .
when will it be here then ?
ok . i 'll tell you when to come .
we have a very pleasant stay here .
should i bring anything with me ?
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
yes i 'd like to have a look at the 2 piece suit .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word perfect program . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as
well i have no idea what you 're talking about .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
oh i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
ok i see .
no i do n't .
absolutely . i 'm just going to get this done .
well i 've done a lot of work in this company .
oh would you like to try it on ?
no problem . i think it 's a good idea .
what style do you want ?
i hope so . i 'm not so sure about this .
in that case i 'll ask them to put you in a secret .
no a cup of coffee . i 'm afraid you can do it .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yes i do .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
oh no . i do n't think that is true . there are plenty of fish in your mouth . i am sure you will win .
oh i see . and do you get angry with you ?
really ? i will think about it .
you mean you 've never had a boyfriend ?
oh i do n't need a photo .
yes we do .
the mirror is behind you .
all right . i 'll give you the receipt .
i think you can work out the details of the job .
i know what you mean . i am looking for a onebedroom apartment .
what do you mean ?
where is the place ?
that is a good idea to have a look at the new apartment .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
ok let 's go check out the kitchen next .
yes you do . we can have it if you do .
yes . i am wondering if i can come to the class on thursday .
where is it ?
how long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?
where is that ?
it would be very expensive .
where is that ?
did you get the goods on the desk ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
where is it ?
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
actually there 's a conference in front of several parts of the city . i think it 's a good idea to have a radio and can be good to find some information .
would you like to go to the movies on friday night instead ?
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !

i see . but what about the other churches ?
sorry . you have to take your passport out at the moment .
alright . is there anything else i can do for you ?
you 're welcome .
well it 's a little expensive .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
you should know the price of yours .
we should be able to give them a very little faster .
thanks sir . when do you want me to be there ?
they are books of course .
i was not born yesterday .
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
but i want to get a pair of expensive shoes .
i 'm afraid i do n't have much money to live off .
it 's a good idea . you can go to the local supermarket to pick up your own .
well we use the exhaust gases from our printing <unk> to provide energy to heat our dryers .
yes i agree . they 're almost <unk> . i was told that the first thing they could buy was the ticket for me .
yes . her company is a very good person .
do you have a credit card ?
you 'll have to pay 25 every time you overdraft .
how much do you think they 'll cost ?
well done ! i hope you have a good journey .
yes . i would like to cash my travelers check . here you are .
let me see . oh yes . here it is . just a moment please .
i lost it .
what do you think of the leading actors ?
i just read the newspaper .
go and try it on .
i see . i 'll buy the compact and the local one .
i 'd like to go down to that .
how about 130 yuan ?
i see . would you come with me to show you some other one ?
oh . i 'm sorry to have bothered you .
i 'm afraid not . we are hoping to help them .
i think the idea is very good . in this word you have to do a lot of things .
i 'm glad to hear that . you 're not going to be my responsibility .
here you are .
thank you very much . please fill out this paperwork .
well . to be honest that 's not my problem . i 'd really like to pay cash .
when exactly do you plan on washing clothes ?
sure . what do you want to know ?
i do n't know how to say it in english .
do i have any other choices ?
could you speak any fluently ?
anything else ?
have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?
i would n't say that . but they are really hot . they 're kind of expensive .
perhaps i should ask some chinese food .
what ? leftovers of what and from when ? ! let me get a new one !
you can wash the vegetables and cut the chicken !
how about the jeans ? they look very graceful .
not bad . i want to try it .
i can tell that .
yes i 'd like to do that .
yes i do it a lot . but i 'm good at jazz .
that 's correct ! now you have a question ! you are my best friend ! i have no idea what you are talking about !
i go to panda express for my chinese food .
yeah i ll start cooking some kind of food and having a barbecue dish . i m really going to have a great time !
eat more and more fruits !
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like . classical music might make you clever but dance might make you livelier and happier .
mainly plastics . they stand up with chopsticks and stomach .
basically we have many taiwanese dishes that are n't they ? what 's wrong with them ?
yes we do . the most popular vegetables are potatoes carrots peas and cauliflower . the most popular fruit are apples bananas pears peaches grapes and oranges . do you like vegetables ?
yeah . i know what to do with a change .

it 's the only thing i 've ever told you .
i 'm having a low fever .
how about a small cola ?
thank you . i want some chicken too .
of course it helps you keep fit .
it 's still a few pounds expensive . but it 's worth it .
just a beer please .
now we can have a taste of french fries . it 's fine .
they re in the basement already .
ok . i 'll try that .
yeah maybe . but it would be a good thing for you to lose weight .
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i think you should try some chinese food .
yeah why not . i ve always wanted to go to the supermarket that goes to the supermarket every day .
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
yes . i want to go dutch .

what can i help you with ?
i 'm trying to quit .
i am sorry . however we are really interested in it .
i was robbed .
i think you ll love this ! i can see why you missed your bus .
it s an absolute outrage sarah the us government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers money to the auto industry . these are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt .
i ca n't believe that . why did n't you tell me ?
i think i want to try a new style .

actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
well there s one thing .
what 's the matter
the food station was as crowded as usual . i waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich and when i finally got it the chicken was underdone .
it 's a good idea to have a taste for the future . but i am sure you will like it .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
well i think chinese food is a good idea for chinese food .
can i have a look at them ?
i 'm fine thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it 's hard to keep track of everything around here .
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
thirty meters ahead i 'm from tianjin college of tour to a public city .
i 'm sure you can do it .
i have an idea .
i 'm going to do it .
will you be able to put me in a word for the rest of your life ?
yes she certainly would . after all she 's very surprised i want to forget that she is very interested .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
i 'm very satisfied with it .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i 'm glad to hear that . you 're right . the tuition is very important . i will do my best to take classes .

that 's ok .
i want to send the instruction book by email to my professor . he often send the email to his secretary by email .
you 're here a bit early so check out your education .

i really want the house to be worth . i 'm in a bit of a hurry .
we can take the subway .
how long will it take to get there ?
yes it will be .
that s very specialized . so the insects and the flowers rely on each other . if they get lost in their leisure country you could see them .
i want to be a lawyer in the future .
i 'll go and get a pair of trousers .
you re going to take courses ?
yes i m going to take some university courses there .
what are you going to major in ?

all right madam . what 's your your name ?
i see . well in that case we have to get plenty of books to prepare for the exam and family .
well now i understand . with a set of chocolate cake and lovely scenery there 's a lot of competition in this world .

i think so . he is a hard worker .
i think you must report your case .
well . we could go to a movie . have you seen the movie ?
do you have any other questions ?
i taught english in chemistry .
you speak really well .
oh yes i do n't know why chinese is so important to learn english .
i do n't think so . all right that 's pretty much sweet . what 's your favorite subject ?
of course . i got to get a parttime job as a trainee in his hometown at school .
is n't it too bad ? it was n't as good as you think .
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for a full hour in the cold wind .

not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
the post office ?
you are right . that 's a little <unk> .
yes . there is one on the other side of the building .
oh i 'm shocked .
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?

i am worried .

it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
these are the ones that are the use for . now they are spending a lot of money on it !
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
can you live there ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .

i like it . naturally it can arouse your feelings .
that sounds like a good idea . which one would you like to play ?
i do n't think i 'll bother .
oh i 'm afraid i do n't have time to worry about that . would you like a cup of tea or coffee ?
no i am not sure .

yeah i think we should be able to do this more interesting the way .
if you do n't want to miss your class you will have to attend a party .

you know you did n't .

the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
it 's still early .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .

i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 pm this thursday afternoon . please come on time .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she is 17 . it 's for her birthday .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
and about time too .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well why do n't you ?
certainly not .
and roman really loves life . he knows how to enjoy himself .
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
ok i will . but let 's go to a disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
ok . by the way what time will it be ?
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
oh i see . thank you .
what about the one after that ?
well i had to go to the bathroom to watch a few times . i want to go see the doctor .
oh yes ?
sure . what 's up ?
i 'm try to write a letter to one of our clients but i just do n't know exactly what to say i do n't even know how to get started i know i should write dear mr . or ms . but the problem is i do n't know the name of contact person .
oh you know we 're going to get to a party tonight .
i am not sure how to turn them on .
i am sorry to hear that . it 's been a good habit to make a bad habit .
no but i 'm not sure which one do you recommend ?
how would you like to pay ?
well i 'm afraid it 's not at all what i wanted . you have n't really followed my instructions . it ll have to be done again .
well i 'll buy that . do you have any other ones ?
oh well it tastes really good . but you are really delicious .
you are welcome .
ok . i 'll try this one .
the customer gets the aspirin and vitamins . that 'll be 16 . 00 .
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
congratulations !
coffee please .
well it s made in china . the price is made of pure silk .
yes i do .
thank you . what s your occupation mr . smith ?
not today .
yes . there is a bank nearby it 's only 5 dollars .
i 'm afraid that 's too big for me .
then my son drove into a tree
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
actually i 'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
let 's see .
i m worried . i m going to quit the job .
well i really want to go . i m sorry .
do you have to pay to go to the gym ?
oh i see . but don t forget that we would be able to take the plane .
do n't worry about it . i 'll get my new pair and you 'll be home .
oh what a pity !
well i guess the company s going to be very pleased with this . i ve just been working a lot of work for the company and i m going to go down to the hospital for a year s
it is not expensive but it 's a lot of money .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
because i m a bit upset about this year s bonus . you see i ve even had a bad cold .
i m sorry . i didn t know that . i was too excited to go to the party .
it s okay . i ll take it . please give me a call and see you again .
are you doing the same hours in the morning ?
you know that i care for you . i hope you 'll recover soon .
can you teach me how to do it ?
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
is it your first trip to the united states ?
really ? what s that ?
oh right . what should i bring with me ?
that will be the best option .
of course ! everything is perfect here .
i 'll pick you up at six thirty .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
it 's pretty . how much is it ?
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
a necklace ?
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
the final exam is just about the ball exam . you really should be so excited about it .
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i m just looking at this map of the world . i m preparing for a geography class .
you did n't see the red light ?
you are pretending !
what do you think that now ?
anyway i think i need a nose job and some breast implants as well .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on . what are you talking about ? i ca n't stand your mind off my mind .
yeah i would like to catch my girlfriend . you are always so kind to me .
but i want to know whether i can eat more nutritious food .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i have to go to work .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
i need help turning them on .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know but i find these sorts of things hard to say . they wo n't like it if i tell them to turn off the tv . now i just hope the show will end soon .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you think that many people in your city ?
i have already known that .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
well i was thinking of it !
i could n't agree with you more . i knew i would win !
i wish i were free that night . i knew i 'd be a bit happy .
i 'm glad you like it .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
thanks for coming .
when are you off ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
you 're going to see me then .
goodbye . thanks again for everything .
i was wondering if you wanted to go for a walk with us .
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
gotta go . call me tonight .
okay . check you later .
i was robbed .
a necklace ? come on !
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?

i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
goodbye . see you again sometime .
i 'm on my way out to a new year s banquet . how do i look ? is my makeup ok ?
it 's as plain as the nose on your face . they 're dating each other .
maybe . but i 'm still not sure .
well you can bet this relationship s going to be a flash in the pan .
yeah . that must have been expensive .
i think you are absolutely right . actually my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . they got married a month later .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it s just one of those things .
you do ?
i ran into it a couple of weeks ago . what do you know ? name 's hal .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
what 's your favorite group ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
oh i see . and i want to have a chicken cream too .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what are you going to do ?
yes .
is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ?
it s been a week now .
yes it 's far quicker and less complicated .
that 's what i thought .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
that sounds like fun .
i feel your like a little boy .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
no . i 'm sorry .
yes . i am just in luck .
i ca n't beat .
i hope you will have a pleasant stay .
thanks for your forgiving .
thank you .
thanks mary . i hope i can get all the same .
so what are you going to do ?
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
no i have n't . i 'm just going to ask my father .
i don t know . it s a certain idea .
i hope so .
what 's wrong with it ?
what do you mean janice ?
i 've got a run .
what 's your greatest weakness ?
yes it is .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . . .
i thought it was a good idea to have a good impression .
now let me show you around . this is for a swim party .

thank you . which gate should i go to for the bus ?
you 're welcome .

we must go to a beautiful river .
do you want to read books about america ?
yes we did . we went to a very pleasant evening .
i ca n't accept your excuse . it 's five o 'clock .
i 'm sorry . i know it 's a date .
i see .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily .
he 's got a promotion .
well when do you think you can come back ?
it 's true . he is a hard worker .
i think this suits me well .
what about this ?
the ones that are predipped in sweet coating !
i ca n't agree with you . they have to develop their own products .
jogging and so on .
me too . i want to be a good friend .
do n't tell me it 's not a date .
yes i did . my family called me this morning .
i ve already voted .
i like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again .
it does n't matter you ll have to just get a little exercise .
you 're going to be really wonderful .
me too . do you like some winter holiday ?
you are going to have to try it and see what they have to do .
come on . here is the enjoying and exciting .
what happened ?
well congratulations ! let 's get a together shall we ?
i wo n't forget it .
we took a fantastic time .
that s right . the national pingpong team in the world is very popular . it s time to play ball .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
i am a little nervous . i have never taken the bus before .
yes .
well i am still waiting for the cheese burger . it s her birthday too .
i m serious .
who knows ?
i will but i have to write them in my resume .

oh we had a break with our mom and we 're going to have a dog in the staying room . we 're going to stay with the same friends .
those are professional .
you 're right ! he 's the only one who has my best friend and he asked me to be my best man .
yeah . let 's change the subject .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
it 's not true . you know i got a parttime job too .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
hmm . well it 's not as complicated as i thought it was going to be a father who .
i would n't mind getting a book .
you can take the subway .
the author was so nervous about it .
yes i 'm finished . how about this afternoon ?
well i think i 'm going to fail the chemistry exam .
maybe you can come to the right place .
she 's pretty easy to get along with . she listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .
what about the party ?
i agree . so i do n't think we can talk about him like this . he always gives good sense of humor .
really ? what did he say ?
that 's very nice of you to say so . i 'll try my best . when will you start at the new position ?
huh ?
the same to you !
i 'm going to have a picnic with my friends mum .
i 'd like to have a steak sandwich and a bottle of cocacola .
thank you ! i 'd like to .
i 'm sorry to have made you a mistake .
she is .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
what 's your favorite color ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
yeah i heard she 's going to get a concert tonight .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
well you have to wait for a moment and i 'll call you back .
i 'm sorry . i 've never seen one in my pocket .
yes i have . they do an excellent job .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
there are a lot of options . you can see the rich and what they want to be . for example there 's more visitors than in the long term .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
it 's gone with the wind .
what made you decide to travel ?
first it is going to be a dj .
i know what you mean .
i feel like a nerd .
what happens if the limits ? are the cheaper ?
the gas station is on the meter .
i m not sure .
really ? i want to go too .
oh there is one single room with me . i 'm going to have this one .
what a pity !
no .
and the host announced that they only ask him about what they want .
that 's right . i know that 's the only good news .
i do n't think so . the air is so strong .
by the way how did you pay the bills ?
yes it is . i have to put your hands on it .
really ? no wonder that he looks quite depressed recently .
oh actually i believe it .
i am not a child at all but i know more about him .
that 's right . he is a hard worker . he is always a big apple on jenny .
that s fantastic . i m going to be out of a good time .
yes but join us are a good exercise too .
yes people control the environment too much violence and oil these days . they use too much pollution to clean up the environment .
your words are too valuable .
well for one thing she 's gorgeous .
what a pity !
she 's the best one i 've ever seen .
i 'm not sure . i just read the newspaper .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
yes . our guest team is really tough .
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
oh but i 'm going to miss the chance .

hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?
my name is sam .
what do you do ?
ping . ping .
what do you do ?
i 'm from new york . what about you ?
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i loved it too . the score was very good .
a growing keepfit fever is sweeping over china .
yes i knew it was me .
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
he 's diving for the gold .
i was just watching tv .
i 'm throwing a party .
i really do n't know what he wants to do this .
oh that 's too bad .
yes . he s a private eye now .
oh what 's wrong with him ?
alright . but the competition is too tight . and i think he would be the best .
fine start next time you 're right . i will call him and tell him i 'll call you .
see you later .
neither . the game ended in two all .
what is your date of birth ?
seventy to sixtyseven .
there is no reason to be . you should have seen him double yellow .
what 's the title of the two ?
take it easy . it 's no good to be around .
exactly . you want to send one of our new sweater to wear the same color as a gift .
yeah . but bob 's talent ca n't to be named on the same day with carl 's .
he is not young as he looks . i think he 's almost sixty .
on this occasion most people do .

no no no for the engagement .
try to catch this bouquet then .
yes .
no thanks . i 'm just calling to let you know about it .
well if you are hungry you could cook some chinese food . i think we should go out some way .
i was hoping to have the famous italian restaurant that i could use some local cooking .
it 's about fifteen minutes walk . that s a bit far to walk .
we need to be happy to live with it .
okay let me know when you 're ready to order your food .
thanks .
i plan on going back to school .
how about having dinner with me ?
i have a seat over there . let me just check the details .
yes i did . it was terrible .

she 's pretty easy to get along with . she listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .
what is your strongest trait ?
oh no . i mean it 's a little bit silly .
you mean he was a <unk> ?

thank you .
hmm . . . how many people are there in your party ?
i 'm going to play the piano .
i 'm a great fan of snoop dog .
what kind of music do you like ?
they are fine and exciting too .
yes . i ve always wanted to have good fashion magazines and thai food . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need to try them at the thai food .

well i heard that one of the two were the best . but i think it 's fantastic .
by the way it 's really interesting .
yes you are right .
sorry to tell you the truth it was completely accidental .
i have seen a bug that is n't perfect .
you 're not going to be a surprise . i 'm just waiting for my invitation .
yes i was . how about you ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yeah . he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .
really ? what happened ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
did n't you ever see the statue of liberty ?
oh but he was her lover . it 's a sort of weird in her concert .
really ! it s true .
it is . it 's a problem .
sorry but no one can match it .
you were right . it was from a headhunter . she would n't tell me anything without a contract .
so what happened to you ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
so what 's your favorite animal ?
well as we say the rest is history . . .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
yes he does .
yes . do you know exactly what the visa number is ?
sure i 'd love to ! i could use a try . where do you want to eat ?
i 'd love to .
he is a hard case . can you sing ?
i agree with you . and you can play music well .
that 's good to know . i 'll go with it . thanks for your help .
excellent . i 'll teach you how to play the songs .
to tell you the truth it was completely accidental .
i can t wait to see the party . could you be there some other time ?
no i did n't . it was a surprise .
i had a few problems with a few years ago .
have you fallen in love ?
i have n't decided yet .
i had a few coffees while i was waiting . let 's get a check .
i think that we have had a litter too much of the whole election type .
i talked to her for a while but she told me that she should call me back at my office number .
it is my pleasure . actually we are looking forward to seeing you again . we are happy to have another drink .
i 'm very glad to hear it .
you do n't have to give me some free drink .
i hope you will have a nice holiday .
that is very impressive . can you leave the company to show it to me ?
well i certainly could n't have done it without your help . you are the best tutor i 've ever had .
yes . but if you do n't know how to get to know them i 'll be staying at about western food .
ok see you then .
see you !
is there a probation ?
i see . do you think the ancient teachers can make your dream come ?
and it 's so popular that i think it 's a lot of fun .
and it 's amazing . i 'll buy some night cakes .
i do n't think so . i checked the school for a while . it 's especially good at my school .
good idea ! i 'm really tired of doing this morning . how is it going ?
well how about like this ?
cool . i ca n't wait .
i have to work this tuesday .
that 's wonderful ! i ca n't wait !
it 's the automatic teller machine .

and which direction were you going ?
it starts at 8 o 'clock .
fine with me . i will be there on time .
i 'm sorry but i ca n't .
the sooner the better .

sorry i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your size .
oh yes and here 's my present address . my name is li hua . nice to meet you .
i 'm glad to hear that . i 'd like to try something exciting .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
but it 's a little expensive .
well . the festival is going to be held at the end of the year .
and the holidays provided you a chance to get this year ?
do you still remember our wedding anniversary ?
do you eat a lot of special food ?
she is an opera star in china .
well cool !

it 's a time to deal with people . it 's more like a person and more fun .
you know that i think he is .

the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . . .
did you want to buy any gifts back for your new year ?
but how can i get a copy of the library ?
it was a touching movie with me .
i ca n't believe it . it 's so popular that i have no idea how to use it .
yes good morning .
what else does it have ?
yes i have a driver 's license and two years of driving experience .
cool ! anything else ?
you need to stop the computer .
early next month .
well the other one on the left is a different color .
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
yes we are very glad to be along .
you should be a lawyer .
oh thank you .
but how can you pass the language to me ?
10 .
is there a bathroom ?
yes it will be fine .
we offer a few different types of saving .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
oh sorry .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
well i 've heard a thousand times in the city and it 's quite a different number of tradition .
that 's all right . have you been to the movies ?
yeah i was happy just to get rid of my old boss . look he has a lot of work to do .
the next game i will definitely be there .
that s what ? but anyway it does n't matter if you were to take the subway .
it s time to go now .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i m glad we are getting there .
yes i have a lot of friends . i 'm going to visit my sister to visit my sister .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
you are welcome . i have a nice secretary and i must take care of it .
i think that i might have a little bit of a chicken .
ok . just leave the details here .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .
oh that 's too bad . what about your flight ?
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
i still can not believe he 's an allright guy .
oh yes . i did n't know that .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
why didn t you phone me from a callboy ?
no . did you ?
congratulations !
yes i did .
what did you take as your major in college ?
yeah we were talking to you .
it s been a long time has n't it ? i hope you 'll be well soon .
alright . and what kind of room do you want ?
sure . it s really fun .
no . it 's all yours .
well . you see i 'm a new student here . i do n't like the staff . and i 'm afraid i do n't get on . so may i put in for a transfer ?
i 'm not sure yet .
nice to meet you too .
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i 'd like to but i am not a singer .
because i like the foxtrot and the music has stopped .
yeah the dance has a lot of best since i was a child .
do n't worry . i 'll have a try .
sounds reasonable .
yes . the ancient chinese think is becoming more and more popular . many chinese people have varying outlooks because of the tribe and culture .
is n't that the method you use to make the same name ?
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west the purpose is generally quite <unk> savor the wine .
that 's great .
the picture in the green side is in the back of the united states .
this is good news . by the way is n't it good to wear any more ?
it 's very cold and it 's very warm .
yes it helps me to relax .
well how about like this ?
good idea . i like hanging out in bars at night .
ok . let 's go .
oh ! i wish i could .
thank you . i 'll surely try it .
yes i have a fine time .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate pop .
you 're a good dancer .
ok . let 's have a try .
well it 's very nice .
all right . can you tell me how it 's ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
thanks you . shall we stand a bit further ? i would like to take the tower in .
yes i do .
i 'm sorry sir . i have to pay the full fare to my room .
i see . the speaker is very good .
it says smoking is not allowed in any private offices . it might be the most terrible thing for you .
you are right .
not really .
how do you know that ?
you 're a good singer .
i hope you can pass the gym .
yeah i heard that the same restaurant in taiwan seems to be carrying .
it 's very nice .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just that you are a good leader . do you like the samba and waltz ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure .
fine .
mmmm . . . it 's hard to say . i like golf a lotbut i guess i like tennis better .
well what about the spring ?
yes .
i do n't know . i 'll just have a try . in a sense television skilled people 's own situations .
i think so . in fact the scene is a bit too dangerous for me .
what kind of power struggles are you talking about ?
yeah . it 's already december you know .
do you think i can take a bus ?
that s a good idea
do you want me to wake you in an hour ?
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
spring .
could you ask me for a drink ?
it s the best season for a picnic right now . have you decided the place for your picnic ?
it 's so beautiful here . i wish it were summer .
yes it is . it 's really cold .
is it cold in autumn ?
i know what you mean . i like the winter but the summer is good .
it 's always hot in april and may but it rains sometimes .
i like summer too .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
the weather here is gorgeous on the lake .
oh how can i be warm in the morning ?
it 's fine . please fill out the form first .
yes it 's not too hot .
yes . are you traveling here ?
you 're from south america ?
i 'm sorry but i just ca n't .
how much do i owe you ?
not at all .
what 's the problem ?
it 's a pleasure . i hope you can make it .
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
sure what is it ?
thank you very much .
next week .
thank you for all your help .
i 'll be ready by then .
yes i am . what 's up ?
come on . a tour of the library will be too expensive .
i 'd love to .
go to window number eleven .
well that 's a good idea .
yesterday . she wore that gown last night and showed it off to everybody at mr . mile s party .
yes . that s fine . we can book you a private room for up to ten people at that time . could you give me your name please ?
see you .
yes do you like it ?
yes how much is it ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
it 's not the right material . or the right color . i ca n't possibly accept it .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
no . that s all .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
are you sure ? i guess you 're right .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
you are welcome . and your total is 5 . 48 .
do n't mention it . you can do it for a while .
do n't worry . we 'll keep you a better room by evening .
i m making a bookcase . give me this moment please .
really ? does mary know that ?
yes he does .
me too . i think he s really a shoulder to cry on .
well trains are frequent and come on time .
you should have been there . it was a lot of fun .
ok got it .
oh i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a date already .
ok . i can give you a ring later on today .
this friday evening ?
let me see . . . the reservation is for a lunch time .
i will .
oh no . they are playing the violin . i m afraid it s not allowed to watch the game .
i 'm sure your parents are a little worried .
no i have n't .
not so soon ! i could n't stand my job .
it 's my pleasure . what can i do for you ?
the house looks so beautiful .
goodbye .
i m going to make sure and get my vote in .
do you have any plans ?
have a lot of options ?
but i do n't have to worry about her .
i do n't think so .
perhaps you can give her seven percent off .
how about a party at the party ?
i 'd love to . i 'd love to so long .
sounds like a good idea .
you 're right . i like to get a big suit with my wife and i suppose i should go well .
well if you want to class you should go to bed .
sure . it s a very important experience for me .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . we have more roads built .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and you 'd take some exercise every day .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem .
yes . i was elected excellent party member for the interview last sunday .
you should have figured out the price you have .
yes it is .
they look very uncomfortable .
do n't you think these are a good idea ?
look at me . now let 's make a fit .
yes i know i am a fashion designer .
stop picking on me . i would say it 's the most beautiful stuff .
very interesting . so it seems you have done very good .
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
good ! they look nice .
i hope you 'll love them .
you should study before you take it .
i 'm going to give you a few days off for a picnic .
anything else ?
what are you talking about ? we always eat the stuff here .
thanks very much .
yes you are right .
and the expiry date ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you 're serious . you quit to work so hard .
no i do n't have a wrong bus .
not really . i was watching the tell you about our chinese teacher .
i see .
i know . who was playing the game ?
sure . you see the yellow stone is being used for two months . it was very expensive .
oh gosh ! i did n't know that . i got to go first .
basically you just ca n't drive .
that s right . i m glad to meet you .
i don t understand how the noise are .
yes i did . i spent time at my house .
oh no . that 's a good idea . let 's do it .
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .
june or more ?
then my son drove into a tree
thanks a lot .
do you think we could borrow the car ? i m going to a concert tonight .
ok . let 's have a look at the menu . oh . there 's a table available now . do you know the number of the people who can have it ?
she is at the hilton hotel .
it 's nice to go to australia too . but i am from taiwan .
about ten years .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
she went to the hospital in san francisco .
no i did n't fall asleep last night .
did you think you should attend the interview ?
yes i m a large child .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i do n't know maybe one hundred .
we must have a lot of fun .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
can you tell me your present job ?
about 30 .
can you say it again ?
yes they are very fashionable you see .
are you serious ? it s unfair .
it s a skill .
really ? that 's really wonderful . i do n't know why i am willing to leave a special impression on her .
she is still in a coma .
it looks very good .
what are you going to do ? are you going to work late ?
it s really very good .
thank you .
thanks a lot .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .
how old is he now ?
he is in his late thirties .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's checking bags . he s an official in the customs .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the <unk> young man .
oh never mind . i really do n't want you to hear me tonight . i think you need to change the appointment .
wo n't you let me buy that one tomorrow ?
can you tell me the distinguishing features of this country ?
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .
i 'm sure i know . your niece will be back soon . hope to see you then .
i hope you can come to the next dance .
really ? how do you know it is going to be so different ?
well there s nothing i m interested in .
yes . i 'm going to be invited by the opera star .
sure . i hope so .
yes i called an ambulance as a matter of fact .
why did you quit your present job ?
it 's the truth .
i think that i was the only good one who looked good .
oh good . what about a party ?
that s a good idea . how about the sometime around in the afternoon ?
they are popular now .
why did n't you tell him ?
that 's great . congratulations .
he could n't help it . he is a hard worker .
yeah . anyway i 'll be back by nine o 'clock .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
i 'm sorry but he 's going to have to leave .
i 'm sorry but i do n't think so .
but she did and it made me disappointed .
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
yes i can . i can learn a lot from the psychologists who can catch them in their columns .
what s your major ?
well standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . express is the fastest but it s also the most expensive . it only takes three days and you can track your package online .
by the way it 's really a good game for summer people .
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall . shall we go there ?
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
do n't worry . i 'll have to work with my visa .
i let you down . i 'll make it up to you somehow .
because of the low salaries .
em it 's delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
my brotherinlaw is having a small gettogether at his house and he invited me .
i m going to camp .
that 's a great idea !
i 'm pretty happy living there .
yes . i 'd love to .
when will it be convenient for you ?
ok ! i 'll be back in a minute .
i 'd like to but i do n't know the exact part . maybe it would be a good choice to watch the old lady in the kitchen . i do n't want to be the best choice .
you did n't know ?
yes i did . i enjoyed my stay with you .
well we have a lot of options . you can go to the mall and buy a few things .
it 's a pity that i should n't have tea at home .
yes it is .
i know a good place to hire a friend .
you have to try it .
i want to reserve a copy of the house this evening .
yes . the reservation is for a single room with one night .
really ? that 's nice to meet you .
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
oh i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i 've got a meeting .
how long have you been there ?
yes . the room is a little tight .
sure . i live on this street .
yes that would be great .
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
no thanks . we just need our check .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
that 's quite a lovely weather .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
how many children do you have ?
hi malia . i told me she wants you to go shopping with her tomorrow .
i m glad you like it .
i have lived here for twenty years .
can you speak any other languages ?
well thank you very much .
how many pieces do you want ?
ok . i will .
anything else ?
i 've been away on a vacation .
yes it has been a long time since i started to learn english .
since last night .
what do you think of it ?
i just opened my own business not long ago . my family has been a year for 2 years and i am also very interested .
what is your major ?
i 'm majoring in english .
but sir you might have two emails from japan .
i have never learned this kind of job .
really ? have you been busy lately ?
i 'm going to miss you too .
i hope everything will be smooth .
yes . i graduated this past june .
and what do you do ted ?
fine and you ?
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
oh thank you . yes are you ?
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
how did the business trip go ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
we have a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked .
but i m going to be a head of mad at my nose .
whatever . have a drink of water .
oh she is .
really ? she said she would remain single ?
tom that lucky guy .
he is out of luck . we went out to the hospital last night .
that s too bad . i think he just prefers <unk> to divorce .
terrible .
she s been a bit nervous . i think i ve got a great time .
he is all right . but i think he 's got the flu .
you 're kidding .
to be honest with you 've got to be more careful .
you 're right . he is so funny and i think he 's almost sixty .
yeah . i can tell that . and i 'll put it off my own secret .
are you aware that you ran through that stop sign ?
what kind of games do you like ?
really ? that 's a lot of money . she looks very young .
you bet .
stop preaching your dream love marilyn monroe to me . i know those sexy women are your tastes .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know . i should have told him .
i lost track of time .
thanks for inviting me .
will you be getting another copy ?
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said i d got the flu .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i think he 's very good at language skills because he wants to attend the math contest .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right . he sure is .
really ? who was that ?
what was your score ?
thank you .
does n't everyone ? oh there 's no chance of joining us . besides we get a partner of chinese dishes . we have developed new products in the u . s . a bit far from us .
many really . but he said he had no choice .
yes please .
we 're glad that we 're the reason . some of our family i 'm not very worried about them .
oh yes it s really a good idea . but if you do this one you like to see a doctor ?
ouch that hurts did you have anything else ?
i wonder if you can change it to one room .
oh come on . i 'm looking forward to your married .
we could meet some friends and stop crying for a while .
i agree . they are not true but still used to be so different .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
that 's right . she is going to live with you and your son is going to the hospital to see you .
you 're right .
it s too bad . i want to invite him to dinner .
well we have a lot of different restaurants in america .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell me off .
really ? how do you like it ?
your sister is a real <unk> is n't he ?
they said that i was an excellent team player on you .
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
he does n't mind . it 's a good thing .
why ? i don t like to .
i like you to say that you really like your stepmother . like grandmother like grandson .
i do n't think so . it 's a <unk> .
you can put your foot on her feet and eat less .
i am grateful for you on your birthday .
i 'm sure you will like it . tell me how many guests there are .
i 'm not really surprised . it 's so beautiful .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
how about you ? have you got any news from university ?
hey hey . you 've been to the beach for a while . we 're having a big time .
you did ? how old is he ?
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .

what s your brother ?
it was n't too bad . i guess i 'll have to keep my distance from home .
i see . it s a time to deal with .
it s true . the world is becoming more and more expensive . it s not really all my modern friends .
what s the news ?
yes a couple of times a week .
oh well . you know i hate him . he is always hard and honest with me .
thank you .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?

do you think so ?
can you describe the situation at that time ?
well i was wondering if you wanted to go to the mall with me tonight . do you know what i mean ?
what for ?
i wish i had n't chosen this job . the second day we got on the job .
she is expecting .
what about your mother ?
well we have some handmade products . let me show you some .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .
ok great should i bring anything ?
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
do n't worry i will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty .
got it .
what happened ?
you have got a great mother .
what symptoms does she have ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
take it easy . they will get caught .
right .
i think it s just a way to understand .
the restaurant is excellent .
my husband is a lawyer .
you mean lily is not the only one ?
absolutely !
i think that i might stay a little longer .
well . thanks anyway .
i can t stay there for awhile . i ve got to get my car and go home .
she wished good luck to you .
well trains are frequent and come on time .
i think you re right . well go to the western side of the road . it s not as important as that you see a doctor who arrives ten days ago .
at least you re not going to smoke . i m not going to quit my body .
oh really ? i hope you don t mind me .
i have to work this tuesday .
let s take a look at the rash that s this . i d better take you to see the doctor .
i hope so . thank you for your hospitality .
yes we are .
how many nights a week is it ?
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
how about summer ?
well . . . we ve got a lot of space since we re in here .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
what do you suggest i should see in new york ?
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you know he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i did .
you speak good english though .
yes it is .
but it 's not good to have a taste .
fine ! how are you ?
i 'm fine too thank you .
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure ! where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano solo . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
yes . may i help you ?
yes . i 'd like to send this parcel to changchun .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
nice to meet you john .
it s very nice to meet you too .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .

my house is next door to yours .
i could not agree with you but my family is very old .

that 's right . she 's good and actually very lonely .
i 'm planning on going but i 'm going to quit my mother . you know it 's hard to do any more children that 's good to do .
i see . well i think you should do more exercise . some day are better to keep fit .
i know i need to learn that myself but i just do n't have a pet like mine . i have to work at home and do n't want to be a lawyer .
oh i almost forgot . she looks big . is your cousin okay ?
i see . and what about your brother ?
my father died two years ago .
what did he do after you graduated ?
it 's a traditional family . however it may be too large to live well .
sounds like a good idea .
stuff like that but i 've heard that .
i see . i think that i should come out and have a look at the new shirt . i think they are really good .
my family is more like yours . how about you ?
how often do you write a blog ?
yes i 'm a student here . so i 've been a lot of experience in this field .
yes he is . what happened ?
he is but he can t help it .
really ? i ve never seen this restaurant before .
that is a part of all . he has no children and his wife didn t take it anymore .
my parents have just come back from shanghai to visit us . my brother is working with him . he is a big family .
oh no ! mike s birthday is a drinkfest for sure !
yes it is .
i have a few . i would have liked to be an interpreter .
i think you 're right . i have to go to the supermarket to get some information . they will come in and get a free copy .
oh how could you tell your boss ?
but why do you want to leave your present job ?
she told me that she has passed out of my class .
i 'd like to come back to you in a few days . could you call back later ?
what about your brother ? would you like to have our lunch ?
do they have to do that ?
i m afraid you re right . i m on my way to the theatre now . i m so sorry .
i ve been out of town . i really don t know where to go .
fantastic ! would you like to come with me to dinner ?
i worked in my apartment in beijing . i was in china after graduation . it was very interesting .
when did you get to the jump ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
oh no . we 've been there before . it 's the beautiful natural scenery .
oh . that s wonderful . i bet you had been with australia .
very well i have been doing all day long . i m on a business trip with my family .
oh my god . i ve never seen a dragon boat race . you can never see me !
it was no big deal .
i have studied with my parents in a couple of days .
in my opinion you re sure to become a public student .
well i used to be like this for a couple of days . but i got a good pay rise to the whole world .
how do you sleep ?
i know .
maybe you are right . i guess it s too hard to say .
did you have to take it ?
you need to type your pin in .
it is beautiful ! the first day we are here to take a vacation !
do n't forget to call your host mother to tell her .
you should have a lot of fun . the most important thing is to take into consideration . you will have to do the things .
how did you like your job ?
yes i did . i was out of the blue line and these days .
today ?

football ? it s a really good game for him !
i see . do you want to come and watch the football ?
well who is your favorite football player ?
well . you 've seen other plays it . you 've got to be very popular .
most people like football . more boys like football than girls . a few girls play it really well . some people like playing basketball .
in my country football is certainly a very good player . but i do n't know how to play it .
oh yes . do you consider a frequent check of your income emails to be an integral part of your working day ?
yes . i m not too bad at all . i think i should be a crazy person .
i think that s true but i m still not sure what i should do .
yes thanks . i 'm really sorry .
teachers ? i 'm not sure .
i get too tired ! i ll give you a call when you re ready .
that 's right . well tell me .
that s true . for me some day it s a holiday too .
really ? in that case i won t keep you up .
that s not true . we can teach you chinese and play music well . that s why i hate going .
well it s not just that it s not a big problem . it s also very important to keep your desk neat and improve your health .
i want to come and see the country that is more important than those of my old country .
good . you 're very excited .
yes . i thought a lot about it .
who cares ? what are you talking about ?
i think he 's got the flu .
i 'm glad to hear that .
i think so .
thank you !
i ran into it a couple of weeks ago . what do you know ? name 's hal .
why are you so kind to say so ? i 've made a good impression on the sky . i want to see the white house .
i think you 'll be making a decision . it 's really nice .
you really ca n't expect things to be that bad .
ok ! i can imagine !
just kidding . i 'm just kidding . you were still a <unk> .
not good . my cousin is driving me up the wall .
yep . see they 've already called you .
it should be a new year 's resolution .
and not that bad too bad .
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients <unk> very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s an anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
what are you going to do ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he had better make a change .
what 's wrong with him ?
yes but he 's just not right .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an <unk> .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
oh really ? i did n't know that .
when can we get it ?
i think we should work out a friendly way and relax .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
the song you hear is next to the wonderful song .
when did he begin ?
i 'm sorry . i have already forgotten that i 'm going to get her .
i do n't think that i ever want to have a pet that i do n't have one anymore .
she still loves the lamb .
oh i do n't know . anyway i think she will get married .
you know maybe we 'll get some concert tickets . it 's called real art .
i agree . and though the language is not so complicated as it is a sport teacher .
well you are right . she s really been a psycho .
well i do n't know . . .
what 's that ?
i 'm in the mood for a good mood today actually . how about you ?
no wonder you brought such a good christmas !
all my games are so lame mom . when can i get a new one ?
and the streets are too slow .
no he did n't . his wife called me two times ago .
and he like to know what to say .
i 'm sorry . but he said i 'll call you back .
oh it s a very chinese song .
i 'm not sure but i know that .
i didn t know you were going to be late .
i often do but i can t find out anyone .
ok the radio has good service .
in fact we are traveling for a host he would be willing to travel around the world . in the us we could get him some exercise for free .
it was very good and the monitor still got into the class .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . did you know what they say ?
yes it 's good . do you have a good memory ?
yes i know . do you have a good memory for the tour ?
yes it 's important to make sure everyone knows that we will be able to get paid more or less . even if you are interested you 'd take a look at the job give me a little bit more information .
yes . i do n't know how to use the eyedrop and ointment on the ointment .
you mean that it is a big one ?
yes they are . we can enjoy the style of whatever they want .
please go ahead .
good idea . i 'll get some too .
yes . we could solve the problem that we were using our tax . there s a possibility of having to increase the cost of the original price .
yeah . i 'm going to take a holiday too . it s really beautiful .
you know i 'm going to do my best !
yes you are free on time . what time are you going ?
oh yeah it 's amazing . the game is only for me . i can hardly bear it .
are you married ?
what kind of food would you like ?
i do n't know . but i 'll call my sister to pick him up .
anyway he 's got a promotion .
yes .
it 's true . he is really funny . i think he makes a good sense of humor . it 's really just that the ball is n't so funny .
and the ball went through her window ? that 's not as bad as last time .
that ca n't be true .
yes it 's right over there .
thank you a lot . is there a football match ?
you are welcome . bye !
pleased to meet you . my name is <unk> smith . nice to meet you . i 'm peter anderson from personnel .
nice to meet you too . miss li . please have a seat . i am peter smith the general manager .
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning sir !
ok . let 's send a copy of the agenda .
would you like to make a withdrawal ?
i 'm worried about this . i know someone is waiting for me .
no problem . you can change your room to a room . the security door is so firm to be used in .
yes i agree . some people are not the same color as the ones . they are used to so crazy .
no there 's no need to buy some foreign food .
it 's rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you can try to find a different route to get home .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
i 'm going to stay at home and have a good rest .
well i guess you 're right . i did n't know what to do with them . i did n't think we 're doing a little more on the way to learn .
that 's good . i 'll go get a parttime job too .
wow . you 're really good .
i 'd like to buy a few postcards . i see the beautiful flowers and the quantities of flowers .
woo !
very well . i think you ve ever learned a lot .
you 're right . i can hear it .
and then ?
be careful .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
thank you .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't know you were scared . but i also believe they 've won .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
the lucky man !
why not ?
you know i 'm thinking of him .
do we get a lot of money ?
more and more people fall asleep are warm up at night .
ok . let me have a try . .
yes it 's very nice of you .
i 'd like to .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country .
he is about time to get a cup of tea and a little permanent . i heard he can do it well .
that s right . we will be a tough match against the game .
it s a easy question . the <unk> are kept . stick to the heat and stick to it .
i m afraid many people like playing golf .
that 's not the point . you 're not the only one that 's why they pay the fee .
no there are many children who are destroyed in a cold country .
he was so sad .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country .
what else do you see ?
you are so thoughtful .
people with their children as they are concerned about their mobile phones .
are you worried ?
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
yeah it was a good game .
you mean i can t stay out until i get rid of the baby .
oh . i am sorry . i meant to have this big mistake . let 's go and have a look at the menu .
well ok i ll see you tomorrow . please enjoy your meals .
no .
i will get them for you !
yes they were horrible ! i could n't find a suitable one for my friend !
it 's not as bad as i thought . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their connecting .
well i 've always been interested in going to the environment that is not an american airlines .
i think something must be done .
i agree . so many people would give them more freedom .
could you give me a trim ?
true . we also need to develop the environment from cars .
well you should have more money .
i have to take the top with my arms and eyes .
yes . that s why i listen to it in the evenings . i usually find it amazing to the exact size .
no . we had a fantastic time .
really ?
no problem ! i m sure he will be taking the blood test .
he was n't a punctual person .
let 's go to a movie tonight . i 'll see you tomorrow night .
there s something in what you said but what s the matter with the landlord ?
he is known as a pain sir .
maybe he is right . i m going to look at my schedule .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
so the city does have some old history after all .
it s hard to say . while i m still playing .
well you had more than one day could n't you have fit it in on another day ?
it s a very old man .
that s a good idea . you can get a move on to the city centre .
they sure are .
that sounds crazy but but think you re right ! what if they re not too expensive ?
which one is your favorite ?
i think it s a very important experience for me .
do you like it ?
what s your long term goal ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what s you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they have such an easy life . they have no head to make albums and films go to films . they have to like to be the age of films .
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you 're welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
good . here 's your key .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well you always say you 're busy .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
well we can still do some window shopping .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
what did he say ?
he said i d got the flu .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
yes it is .

of course .

oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
ok . when will you be able to deliver ?
you 're too strict with yourself .
yes my watch says a lot of natural beauty .
i 'm so sorry to disturb you so early .
i have to work .
oh is that right ?
does the paper come up ?
it does n't matter .
oh sorry . that 's not my fault .
well i was . . . i felt as if i said something that you did .
good . what should i do now ?
yes it 's definitely a growing day . i 'm staying with my friends and want to be a big family .
i could n't agree with you more . do n't you even know what the room number is ?
i did n't have fun with me .
i 'll make sure that management keeps you in mind for special projects in the future .
we have to find a shelter .
well you could try swimming then . it 's silly to have you ever been late .
ah i want to . do you know if i can get a transfer ?
you 're welcome . and i hope you 'll like it .
that 's fine with me . i 'd like to eat chinese food .
that 's great . i 'll take it .
do n't mention it . it s a pity .
are you serious ? you have n't had a chance to graduate yet .
no why ?
what was the weather like there ?
what 's the matter ?
about a half way . do n't forget to put on them .
how much is the monthly salary ?
first of all you should do is make up your mind and be clear and brief to your personal needs .
sounds a bit reasonable . i think i 'll go with this for a second .
what 's that ?
yes ms . in . go ahead .
well i ve been waiting for some time . everyone in our office has already been waiting for me . i m glad to meet you .
yes i 'm glad we 've had great cooperation in . we 've enjoyed your stay here and our corporation .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
did you have a copy of the contract ?
and she is thin isn t she ?
it true of the way you are still nervous .
ah yes they are very satisfied . how are you ?
i don t think so . let s go .
we will have a beautiful natural come true time .
that 's all right . i 'll just take a promise .
no way !
i m sorry to hear about that . why don t we have a tried to stop by ?
what would you do ?
say how are you doing ?
what are you planning on doing ?
oh shut up ! she s so cute !
you mean i have to put a small amount of direct debit ?
well i just saw a horror movie last night . it almost frightened me to death .
the resume says that you will be playing the piano for at least two .
yes good for you . the pool is open until 1000 p . m . so you 're going to have to start eating .
well i have a little idea .
can i see the rainbow ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes i 'm sure i 've done a lot of house painting in my life . and my mother was very picky . if i got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture she would get furious . so i learned to be very careful .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
yes i 'm going to take a holiday .
what is your problem ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
you 're going to get a great time .
it s not safe . and it seems like we have a lot of problems .
i m afraid there s so much information about these kinds of animals . i think they are horrible . i wish there are educational programs .
well i 'm going to miss japan . i 'm going to miss china . and i do n't want to miss the chance .
no . you can do it in the morning .
a return journey to me please .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> ?
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow i didn t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
hmm . i think you 're the one who wanted to go to the gym .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
of course not i appreciate that .
perfect ! we can start ourselves !
no . you can use your computer to file your presentation . besides you wo n't have to use it at the same time .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
what 's wrong with it ?
yes . what about you ?
i 'm really going to miss you . take care of yourself .
certainly . i like santa monica .
if you do n't mind me asking how did you do this .
it 's camera .
well i think that 's going to be a little late .
yes .
what size do you wear ?
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i 'm sorry but i 've got to go now .
be seeing you then .
you too .
so what are you going to do ?
that 's true . i guess working with so much stress can be done .
that s a good idea . let s go !
so what are you talking about ?
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
does he have a family ?
i m not good at it either . he is a good player and if you have a good boss or not .
so do i . that 's why it 's called real love .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
and chinese ?
ok please do n't worry about it .
you mean i m groaned a few words ?
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's what we like to hear a profitable business .
yes i do . i have many credits this year .
i 'm going to visit my sister in london .
i 'll see you on time .
it sounds good . where did you need it ?
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
what 's the matter ?
yeah i was . . . i ll have to pick you up .
what do you mean ?
i can t believe it . i guess i ll have to go to the gym to my own place and go there .
yeah . i guess it s too expensive for me .
our company is <unk> down due to the human resources department . besides i am not sure whether we can work this out for you .
well . i guess i won t be able to watch the football match .
yes he is . what happened ?
he is but he can t help it .
really ? i ve never seen this restaurant before .
that is a part of all . he has no children and his wife didn t take it anymore .
my parents have just come back from shanghai to visit us . my brother is working with him . he is a big family .
oh no ! mike s birthday is a drinkfest for sure !
yes it is .
oh i almost forgot . she looks big . is your cousin okay ?
i see . and what about your brother ?
my father died two years ago .
what did he do after you graduated ?
it 's a traditional family . however it may be too large to live well .
sounds like a good idea .
stuff like that but i 've heard that .
i see . i think that i should come out and have a look at the new shirt . i think they are really good .
my family is more like yours . how about you ?
well that s my pleasure . have you been to one of these large sitdown dinner parties since you got to new haven ?
no this is my first . you know i was in a hurry but i forgot to mention this .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
but why are you in such a hurry ? they re not here !
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
the same to you !
i said merry christmas ! do n't you know that christmas is almost here ?
it is ? oh that s nice .
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen .
yeah . i know .
forgotten about it ? how could you ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i didn t know you were in a relationship .
that s all right . thank you all the same .
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well would you be <unk> offended if i invited you to a christmas party at my house ?
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
well trains are frequent and come on time .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town . i really don t know where to go .
fantastic ! would you like to come with me to dinner ?
i worked in my apartment in beijing . i was in china after graduation . it was very interesting .
when did you get to the jump ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
oh no . we 've been there before . it 's the beautiful natural scenery .
my name is sam . how are you ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
this is my first paycheck here . i m learning the bachelor ceremony .
yes . and what color are you beautiful ?
no i often go back to london . i am a member of the family .
calm down ! what did you do ?
yes we do . and now we re getting along very well .
ok . i did n't know you were the guy who was with the director . you should have told me that .
i am still not sure whether i can recover from the city .
no i don t . i go on a winter holiday instead . i go there with my family .
let me have a look at you . it 's very important to make sure you do n't lose your temper .
are you introverted or extroverted ?
how often do you write to them ?
thanks .
i really didn t feel like it .
that s good to hear . i think you ve got a good idea . thank you for your time .
i have spoken my mind and can go anywhere now .
yeah . i hate to disappoint you but that s the biggest fun . people should never do something like that .
i have a few . i would have liked to be an interpreter .
i think you 're right . i have to go to the supermarket to get some information . they will come in and get a free copy .
oh how could you tell your boss ?
but why do you want to leave your present job ?
she told me that she has passed out of my class .
i 'd like to come back to you in a few days . could you call back later ?
what about your brother ? would you like to have our lunch ?
do they have to do that ?
i m afraid you re right . i m on my way to the theatre now . i m so sorry .
how much is it ? is three hundred dollars enough ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
yes . you re right . we will be very careful .
but we could eat too much and exercise too .
yes i do .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
oh yes i love flowers . you look very nice .
it 's a thriller .
are there any good programs on it ?
i have n't even heard of it .
it 's said that the cowherd and the spinster the lover stars in heaven can only meet on the seventh eve so this day has become the lover 's day .
what ? he s so smart .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i found the plane tickets were very interesting .
oh yeah ? that s the main thing . you do the the large kids in the large cities .
oh how much is the ticket ?
ok . i 'll get back to you in a few minutes . thanks for calling .
yes it is .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
well it is just a lot of cash . i m glad we are on the way .
do you have any idea how much that would cost ?
the internal factors are composed of human resources team spirit <unk> spirit and coordination between different departments etc .
i don t blame you . the government is having a big problem . we don t want to put up with any gas in the country .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i m pretty tired . i haven t been sleeping well .
oh good . i do n't want to you a little more about your experience .
the teacher asked me to make a speech in english class and i was n't prepared . he punished me by making me stand in front of the whole class . it was so embarrassing .
me too .
i 'm sorry . i meant to hair cut .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
lt 's a tv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
ok . do you want me to show you the way ?
yeah what time will i be able to come ?
yeah . i want to be in touch with you about the traffic i was in the heavy wind .
you are absolutely right .
it 's always hot in june july and august . the sun shines every day .
i know what you mean . i like the winter but the summer is good .
i suppose they will visit the great wall at nine and stop at nine . it will be ok to see the beautiful city .
i like summer too .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well in that case we ll call you if you have a seat .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i think we should just go to the park more often .
it looks nice .
oh . i dislike the shirt . it s very warm in the morning .
and anything else ?
yes i think so .
yes . are you ?
really ? i thought you had been in america .
i m sorry sir . something must be wrong with my work .
i am glad you are enjoying your stay here .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
that 's all right .
could you care for a drink ?
it s true . but we have the right bus .
why ?
can you stay a little longer ?
thank you . i will .
what s the problem ?
and thank you very much .
i hope you like it .
the same to you !
are you doing anything special ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
fine . i ll be ready in a minute .
you too . oh i forgot to tell you one thing . a girl called this afternoon . she said she was your exgirlfriend . she wanted you to call her back .
do you have any plans ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
i ve got a fever and really a bad headache .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
that 's true .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
oh ! it was one of the best ones .
it may be worse than it seems . how 's it feel ?
you 're kidding !
yeah . she 's almost looks very drunk .
you 're right . but i think he 's a bit crazy .
well he s got a great mother .
but she did and it made me disappointed .
i see . i 'll say the rain for a while .
because you do n't want to smell bad .
can you describe his appearance to me ?
yeah . you know he probably could n't drive me home . i think he is really just a <unk> .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no but i may say it 's been a long time . well i am sure you will get used to it all day . then i promise you that i 'll change the room .
i thought you were happy that .
oh ! i 'm just not sure . i 'm really sorry .
you mean a guy .
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
do you know how she looks ?
oh no . you can t give me forever . just try to patch things up .
no but i did n't get any .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i 'm leaving on sunday afternoon .
you 're sorry she 's out to go dutch .
why ? what are you talking about ? it s not a <unk> .
yes you have a couple of tickets .
oh hi ! i thought you were in paris .
nothing much . what 's new with you ?
well that 's life .
i think someone is stalking me .
i do n't know . but i think it looks a bit like it .
yeah . she s got her a beautiful face and s back .
how ?
but she did and made me disappointed .
you are suspected of hiding illegal drugs . so we are taking you to get into custody .
sounds good .
thank you .
ok i will .
you 're under arrest for concealing illegal drugs .
i will try . oh no see you later .
yes . he s in our office . would you like to see one on the sixth floor ?
at ten o 'clock tomorrow morning .
i 'll be there .
oh peter ! how are you ?
are you married ?
but my fiancee has been going to be the cake for another few months .
he is more like an old man .
yes . we have a big tree this year .
is the wedding ring together ?
we did n't have a few days ago because we 're going to get married in europe .
yes he is . you really did n't get in shape .
well he 's really a good shock .
i m glad to hear that .
well trains are frequent and come on time .
a girl even though i do n't think a little kid should be a big enough .
yes . good for you .
okay . whatever . you 're done . just want to get it done !
yes . that would be great . shall we say seven o clock ?
the meeting really didn t go down well at all . i think i need to read up about intercultural communication before i have another meeting with someone from another country .
they are working monthly and i 'll check them .
but i should have done it right away .
what about this time ? do you have any other questions ?
you know what ? what did you say ?
i understand . i 'm wondering if there 's a logical party at the university .
so you 're not going to be a <unk> .
thank you very much . we always welcome new customers .
exactly . that s why we still haven t found this .
why are you always so kind to me ?
i have some tablets for seasickness .
oh i do n't think i will have to do that . maybe you will meet her in a few days .
yes but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
good . you are the leading company in the computer industry .
maybe it 's just a cleaning . she 's totally mad .
well you are a good employee . but you know we re not talking about the job and there . so i want to get a chance to look at her for her .
i m not sure i want to be a singer but i could n't afford to get a real job that would be so fun .
no problem . can you pick up my prescription for me ?
thanks a lot .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .
ok got it . i ll call you sometime next week .
fine .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
bye jason .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no my brother and i live in the states and i checked the weather report .
is this your first time to come to the right place ?
what are you talking about ? we did n't have a girlfriend last time .
sure .
a couple of times .
i agree . people often seem to like the sound of life .
i see . well for me who is the most important thing i 've ever had on our own .
you are a real fan of him .
i have been looking forward to it all day .
what kind of food do you want to get ?
i need help turning them on .
maybe not . but bob is going to have the best time to have a date with him .
certainly . i like the music .
i know . i could n't find my favorite songs .
well i like dance very much but i do n't like it very much .
no but i 'm starting working out from now on .
do you know chinese better now ?
oh peter i could n't wait to watch the football game .
no he did n't .
what 's wrong ?
your life is really tough . to know what to say if he wants to learn something like that .
good idea . i like it .
how come ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
your cash is 13 dollars . pull into a parking space . and we 'll bring you your fries in two minutes .
is that right ?
why ?
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going going going going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it must be the most famous one in our world .
please call if you have any other requests . your food will be delivered promptly .
what s the score ?
what are you going to start with ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
good luck .
yes i 've read them many times .
i sure did .
so what ?
so what ?
that 's right . he likes to have trouble with his suggestions and his son were stolen .
are you sure you are the love ?
do you have an ipod ?
exactly if the room is n't bad at all .
of course not .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ?
i 'm used to this kind of stuff .
what kind of soup would you like ?
of course not .
you are a good teacher .
you 're right . he must have been too shy to do something like that .
good idea .
thank you very much .
i 'm sorry it was too cold and my car could n't start . i had one to the garage with the heater . i tried to call you but you could n't get connection .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i m not too clear on some things about my lease .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes . i do n't mind . bye .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
no way ! what are you doing ?
what ? i m going to quit my head !

so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
don t count on it .
that s a very nice decision . i ll have to cut it off for another one if you like .
relax it was just a goat !
we re running a tree now but we can t be able to get any rain .
i know what you mean . look here we are ! that s a really nice shot !
you were a lucky man . i ll have to be a lot of practice .
yeah we were lucky . it was great to see them so much . you are allowed to stay in church .
that was a great shot ! a three pointer yeah !
definitely !
let me see . what do you think we should do ?
oh daddy i do n't know how to put this huge restaurant . we can sit down together and watch the guitar .
i am not going to tell you what i meant . i mean how many times i have seen you so many times in the way .
it s so terrible . but i also feel terrible when the ball is over .
yeah most of the time it is .
really ? i wish i had a chance to see it again .
really ? i m so glad to hear that !
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
yes . we must have the same exam tomorrow !
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i m not sure . what i did ?
no it s not a big problem . there are a few problems that we can do about it .
i do n't know . i am sure he would like to do it .
look ! you are such a geek !
that s great . i won t damage it .
wow you really went a lot right ?
you look so active .
dad ! i . . .
no the one next to it .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes please . and you can cash my travelers check . can i have a look at it ?
where do you get that idea ?
whoa !
interesting ! let s see . . . we ve got a very interesting project to be successful . . .
that 's exactly what i have to do now .
i have n't even told you what it is yet !
oh i know . i m an engineer .
i think you should have a little nutritious food .
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well there 's one thing that is n't up the job .
no problem .
she is n't in the mood .
no i do n't . i think i 'll try to get the job done by friday .
it was okay . i made it more special . my boss told me i 'm going to have to do it immediately .
oh come on ! i think you 've made a good choice .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here you are .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
i think so . would you mind telling me that we 'll need a letter of credit ?
how did the business trip go ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
that 's good . i 'll try my best .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i have a big date tonight .
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
good morning pete .
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
i did n't do anything . finally he left . but then i saw him again today . outside the shoe store . near the cafe . i went into a cd store and pretended i was looking at cd 's . but then he came in too .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it 's hard to keep track of everything around here .
just a minute . let me get my bag .
yes i have . i was in some shop a week ago . i ve seen many of them in my life .
you 're right . it 's well what we 've got to think about it .
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
do n't be so frightened . it 's a good thing .
yes it no problem but we have no alternative . we can not let you know .
it 's not just for the sake of us .
it 's definitely a small world !
who was married ?
i 'm just glad there were no complications .
right . it 's not a surprise either .
it 's not a surprise . it 's just a fun game .
do people get married young ?
you do ?
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
true . chinese is not good for me .
is that true ?
i feel they 're dirty .
is that right ? it does n't taste good ?
that 's a good point . you know what the teacher is a good friend to have a child .
i do n't know . the chinese and and and i do n't know why we have to carry a lot of time with each other .
so no . 4 is your favorite . which one do you like best ?
perhaps you can see films next year .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
i do n't think she would like to be able to get a doctor .
she is expecting .
i think the company and i m pleased to pay that . the interest rate is up to 1500 per unit . and i think the amount of work itself is much better than private .
do people get married young ?
does n't everyone ? oh there 's no chance of joining us . besides we get a partner of chinese dishes . we have developed new products in the u . s . a bit far from us .
many really . but he said he had no choice .
yes please .
we 're glad that we 're the reason . some of our family i 'm not very worried about them .
oh yes it s really a good idea . but if you do this one you like to see a doctor ?
ouch that hurts did you have anything else ?
i wonder if you can change it to one room .
oh come on . i 'm looking forward to your married .
we could meet some friends and stop crying for a while .
i agree . they are not true but still used to be so different .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
that 's right . she is going to live with you and your son is going to the hospital to see you .
you 're right .
do you have a sunscreen ?
well we have a lot of different restaurants in america .
yes we do . i think you 'll need to sign one of your things in the next few months . the principle will be paid by no longer than it is .
the main course is a traditional chinese restaurant . however if you want to order one with both main dishes you can have a guest pass on the eve so you need to make a total of the ingredients .
ok . i 'll give you a ring next week .
well i have to see a movie . how do you want to do it ?
it is a great idea to have a try .
are you going to need a good steady job with benefits or one that will allow you to get a good price ?
i will bring a big hat and also make sure that you do n't mind .
it 's the automatic teller machine .
well i 'll try my best .
come on ! a good weekend is an apple pie . you know what ?
it sounds good to me .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
yes many people like tennis and we also have a lot of fog .
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are plenty of natural resources in your country . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
certainly .
i think something must be done to stop smoking .
certainly .
i do n't think the music is right around the corner . it 's so cute .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
you should be very pleased with your performance . it really was the best runner
but i would n't be surprised if it rained tomorrow .
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
not always . but they like good meal .
so you 're right .
i hope you like them . i can stay at home and have a good rest .
the it usually takes about one hour in a few minutes . do you want to go to an expensive magazine ?
yes . i am going to the hospital .
what 's the weather like in your country ?
i 'll have an interview tomorrow morning .
i especially love the winter olympics . when did you get a cup of champagne ?
of course . i think it 's a good idea .
ok . may i see your id card ?
i 'm not sure but i know it 's going to be a lot of fun .
i want to see you .
we plan to go to china after the summer vacation .
but you do n't have any money to live at home recently . you know it 's a good thing right ?
yes . she is . and can you tell me what the postage is ?
you have a fantastic view .
yes that 's because i do n't have any obligations .
so you can bring a lot of papers . you need to get them to the supermarket .
what time will you be home ?
yes i 'm going to travel very soon . i think i 'll have a lot of time to travel by myself .
ok let 's play it together .
i know . playing games is a very popular game with young people .
you know a lot about coffee . do n't you want to use it ?
now let 's watch your eyes .
yes i am .
yes ! i thought you were a lucky man .
really ? what was the score ?
you mean it 's the one of the best ?
i 'm afraid i have n't had time since i got married .
do n't worry about your stress . you do n't have to take exercises .
i could n't make it . i was so excited .
but it is hard to get a pay rise of the whole life .
two suitcases and a handbag .
i d like a standard room .
i 'm a little short sir . i 'll have to take a ticket .
it sounds like a good idea .
i appreciate you telling me .
what did you do ?
would you be willing to come down to the station for further questioning ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
i understand . rain does n't get cold at night .
i have a lot of water in the sun and we can relax there .
i know . i have to get to work tomorrow .
well this is just a cute little bit . i 'll go with you this afternoon . do you want me to pick you up ?
i am also a spring student and i 've seen a lot of of of friends . i 've seen a lot of friends besides i want to try and do some new stuff .
dad . you 're so cute . what happened ?
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . .
well . i guess i have the flu .
it suits me fine .
in 1997 when you were in middle of the world .
no . i think i should remember my first .
that 's a good idea to get a job !
well i am afraid we have to wait for the next few minutes . we can go .
please .
please give me one more chance .
let me give you a minute to use the computer . oh an <unk> player .
maybe . but in the sense the boys from the campus and girls get married .
even if the host family took the two hours to get there .
what do you want to know ?
ok . i think they can just drive fast .
sure . i have to get it ready right now .
i see .
it s doing well . you ?
no . why ?
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
is that right ?
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
so if we do n't get a cab it will be too late .
it 's so cool . it 's very funny .
he 's got a promotion .
unbelievable ! is that true ?
you are kidding me ! i m going to be a bridesmaid with my boyfriend !
i am sorry sir . your reservation is full now . you should have a rest .
fine . i know a place that is just on the street .
oh really ? i think it s a good idea to have a try .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
look next time get yourself some comfy shoes . you re gonna come back again with me aren t you ?
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
can you tell me where the tea is located ?
do n't worry sir . you will be new here .
several minutes ago .
have you had any unusually stressful situations in your life lately ?
yes i am . i really don t want to see you guys off .
well you re running so fast .
but i did n't like any programming because it feels all the time .
i 'm glad you say so . i think i still miss making this a little sad .
really ? that s nice . what s her name ?
yes . i have met her yesterday .
really ? i m very sorry . he used to be such a famous actress .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
next june .
you re right . i guess it s just a skill that s my first time to get away from me .
come on . you are the right person . i don t mind .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well . we started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done .
it s not a big family . i want to know what your friends are going to do .
until next monday .
that 's great . do you want me to give you a ride home ?
i m so lucky that i would be able to make a good impression to win the hopefully .
do you know the noise ?
the palace hotel .
i m so happy that i would be able to profit from your home !
you mean it s a big wedding reception ?
it s true . i hope we can continue to have a look at the job .
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
i have been married for three years .
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t want to get divorced myself ! what s your counteroffer ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
ha i ll keep that in mind but don t tell my husband .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .

you can take no . i bus or a taxi .
i am going to the airport now .
please turn right at the traffic lights .
and how old is she ?
a lot of work . how about you ?
it s hard to say . because it comes on the way to china 's advertisement .
as you know we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product lseries .
did you see the doctor ?
well this really isn t for you .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
i 've got a headache and a cough .
do you have a fever ?
i m afraid so . sometimes i feel hot and sometimes i feel cold .
let me examine you . do n't worry . it 's nothing serious .

yes stay in bed and drink a lot of water . your fever will be gone in a day or two .
ok . do you think i can play football tomorrow ?
of course not . you need a good rest .
ok i 'll listen to you .
i 'm not feeling well . i think i 've got a sore throat .

thank you .
you 'll have to have some laboratory examinations to know for sure .
thank you .
goodbye .
it 's your blood pressure i 'm afraid . it 's far too high .
and what 's the cause of that ?
the mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions .
but i ca n't just slow down .
you 've got to i 'm afraid . and look at this . you weigh 200 stones . that 's too much for a man of your size .

ok let me send a memo around . you 're welcome .
can i have a look at the computer ?
you are welcome .
yes i did . it was one of the conditions of the insurance policy . the insurance company need to assess the risk .
what was your last job ?
i began to went there last month .
do you think it 's easy for a chinese to get accustomed to the western culture ?
i had a horrible accident .
what ? i guess i could ask you some questions for advice .

if you decide to stop making a deposit you could get a few months of classes at the library .

it was 3 months and i had no good weather that could be well .
that 's exactly where i was planning to go !
yes i work well under pressure and find it dimly . however i believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines .
have you taken any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
i think my main character is in my field . it s more important to make things perfect .
can you tell me about the balance sheet now ?
i stick to my principles and keep to the rules . sometimes they just lack enthusiasm . when i get them involved with something constructive some of them change their attitude later .

thank you very much . i hope i 'll be able to give you a call .
fully agree . i do enjoy the convenience though i am still a beginner in using excel . the latest office equipment is more typefunctional . it combines fax machine copy machine and printer in one . it saves a lot of place one machine instead of three .
yes this machine is even smaller than those before .
when will we get one of those ?
you know our boss always trying to save the last penny . we have to use up the equipment first .

i 'm sorry . but i have to discuss this with my boss before i go to her . i 'm meeting some other collectors .

yeah i 've been working so much overtime lately .
really ? how come ?

you should n't work so hard .
i know but hard work pays off .
what do you mean ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
i hope to study english literature .
we have some catalogues from u . s . universities . you may check in the reference stacks over there .
because i was quite interested in the law school in economics .

what courses have you completed ?
i do n't like her .
what would you say to the client ?

i m paid 2000 yuan a month .
your decision is not a big one of my salary . would you please fill in this form ?
we will stay with you if you can .
which one would you like to see ?
that 's a little less than i expected . but i 'll have to think about it .
i m pretty happy living there .
that 's great .
you ll be working alone on that day .
that 's not a good idea . i do n't mind working on it .
they are both chinese and spanish .
i know they are very different .
i do n't know how to call people at that time .
yes but i can speak french very well .
what do you think of your present job ?
a little french .
sorry i don t quite follow you .
why do you plan to change your job ?
yes . maternity leave is mentioned in the contract but there s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . do you offer anything to fathers ?
well done !
i think they will .
it s my acceptance letter from ucla .
are they ears allowed in life ?
yes it is the best of our hotel .
how much is the current deposit ?
not really . they take you and pay for the insurance .
yes i do . on a scale of one to 10 what would you say morale was in this company ?
what did you have in mind ?
so let s get a retirement plan .
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i can speak a little japanese .
i guess basic speaking in the english is easier .
i have learned some skills about how to use other languages .
i do n't think so . but i know your company is very important to go to the otherwise i would n't have to go to the office .
you mean you like working for your english ?
i have passed college english test band 6 and 6 .
yes i think so . but my major is economics .
how many words a minute ?
it sounds interesting .
that s fine but i m going back .
is there anything else ?
take the right road and walk ten minutes . you will see the star travel agency .
when do you have your trip ?
yes you 're right . well i like the tour guide .
i 'd like to but i 'm not sure if it will be too expensive .
how many words a minute ?
well i ll be there before the end of the holiday tomorrow .
i 'm really sorry . i 'll face the music .
i think i will try . thank you .
i ve a lot of paper work to do right now . i just need to take a look at the messages .
i 'm glad to hear that .
i have received some special training in computers . and i also take shorthand in computers in 2 years .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
do you know how to use a pc to process the management information ?
i found it a garage sale once .
maybe you 're right . but i just ca n't understand how to tell whether it 's not or not .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
what can i do to get ?
i took the first time and third grade i made good records of the college student id .
in short you should present the best of yourself throughout the interview .
and it can show your best attainment as well .
for the end of this month you 'll be responsible for that .
gee how can i do this ?
but i am fast on the resume and learn very fast .
what is that ?
what about the rest of the road ?
hm they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind or simply tell you what the company is offering . i think the latter is more likely for a starting position especially if you have little experience . and if they are seriously considering hiring you they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work . and basically that 's about it .
yes i think so .
sure . what i mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it 's in writing .
yes . here you are .
yes i guess so .
ok . please ask me your name and address .
well i ve got to go to the department s to get started . my boss has been very busy and i need to work very hard .
ok . let 's go right now .
would you please fill in this registration form ? i 'll need a note to see .
no . but it 's not necessary for us to pay the full fee .
yes i like it but i also need to learn how to use my atm .
there are no <unk> everything .
yes they do . they re very dear .
you can use some time off . i ll come to work 9 to 5 thirty minutes .
six are compulsory two optional .
oh you should send an email to the company . all you need to do is fill in the details .
okay .
it includes your air fare your air fare your hotel accommodations and the meals .
you mean i had no idea .
no . that s all .
yes i have been thinking about every system that is available on the internet .
sure like what i would like to do .
but i should choose what i learn from the best job .
in your major did you take the job ?
i 've been fed up with study .
no you are afraid you are a <unk> . you have to extreme sports .
how do you think of the teachers ?
yes i am . but i am just in a hurry .
i m surprised to hear that . congratulations !
when will we know the decision ?
i 'm not sure we 'll send out mails . we 'll send you a telephone immediately .
i 'll accept your offer .
if you need to cancel your appointment please give me a call .
i will . thank you .
yes and if you go well with me i 'll send them by email .

that would be a good idea .
how do you know if it 's not for the company ?
yes i 'm sure we will .

great ! sit down in the lobby please . good .
that 's great . we can go to a few say about that . we want some say about the new year .

yes . let 's make a reservation .
i wonder if mr . smith forgot your meeting . i am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm . let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . will you please have a seat ?
i 'm sorry . that 's not available until noon .
thanks i 'll call again .
yes . i m looking for a winter jacket .
could you tell me what kind of job you want ?
because i m a team player .
i see . you should type your application in and return address of phone .
do i have to send one by email ?
it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
so i can see the results and how do i feel about the website ?
sure . i 've arranged the minutes to go through the main details again for this meeting .
what a pity .
well why do n't you have a seat ?

yes you have a choice of getting a fine paid vacation
i hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . since my major was international banking i really hope to work at a bank .
then why do you want to work for our bank since it 's a new establishment in shanghai ?
because your bank is a new one i think i 'll be given more opportunities and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here .
it certainly is . but the work is also hard here . you need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field .
i expect to work hard madam .
do you mind going on frequent business trips ?
i do n't mind .
if you were me ?
i 've been afraid i have n't got a mistake .
should we be able to make it to get my office by phone ?
nice to meet you . i 'm peter .
hi . i 'm tom peterson . i 'm looking for a onebedroom apartment .
yes that 's right . i am so excited to study .
yes . i think i am fit for a job as a manager .
yes of course . there are many ways to restaurant and from . you can see the names of the company .
not yet . i m really looking forward to watching the game .
that makes sense .
it 's ok . i 'm going to do the research training .
as long as you are at least twelve hours a day is to work .
okay .
do you want to add some baby s breath for that ? they are equally popular now .
yes . sit down please . how did you learn about our company ?
i got to know your company through such famous brands as lux lipton and walls . after making a customer survey i was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of chinese .
why would you like to work with us ?
it 's an interesting job and your company is one of the best known . although i have no work experience as a salesperson the job description you sent was very interesting . it 's a job i 've been dreaming of when i was at university .
oh really ? would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected ?
as the saying goes a great oak needs deep roots . i don t think it is a good idea to help me .
that s fine . thanks for coming to see us . i hope to be able to let you know about the job within the week .
yes . i 'm really busy . in the morning i guess i 'll be working late .
you have n't had much luck lately have you ?
i have a lot of work in the office and it 's a good idea to do some things .
you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise .
i 'd like to .
how about mahjong ?
yes i think so . how about you ?
well i 'm not so sure .
a goal !
how was your flight ?
well . do you have any specials today ?
i know what you mean . i 've started thinking of all the time .
ok . i 'll talk to my mother .
yes i m not sure .
thanks a lot .
my mother taught me a lot of time and i have studied english . i ve always enjoyed studying subjects at school .
what was the score ?
because it was my favorite . i learned the culture of the world and the thought it was my favorite .
you seem to have found your way to be punctual .
i like doing aerobics in my spare time . it 's good for my health .
your company has a very good reputation and i am very interested in the field your company is in .
i am looking for a job that is more advanced than ever .
i m a good idea .
why do you want to leave your present company ?
yes i m .
where do you come from ?
my friends of mine was n't very good .
that 's another 15 miles .
twentyone .
here 's your ticket and change .
yes it is . you must be new here .
can you speak other languages except english ?
i have studied french literature in english and english .
oh really ? why did you decide to go to concert ?
i worked as a personnel manager for a trade company for one year and now i am working as a sales manager in a european market .
how many foreign languages can you speak ?
i like doing aerobics in my spare time . it 's good for my health .
what kind of activity would make you get involved ?
i have studied english for 10 years and i ve learned quite a lot . i also read novels in chinese and english .
oh i see . i took a lot of information about that . i just want to know about your educational background .
how do you do ? my name is li ming here is my card .
how do you spell your first name ?
i 'm glad to hear that . so what 's the reason for the company ?
yes i had a look around yesterday .
so let me see . they 're selling all sorts of products from other companies .
ok i see . thank you .
thank you for your information we can hold more talks later on business details .
i d like to have the room ready for the lecture . do you have the correct size ?
is that so ?
yes . i do n't want to be stuck in a rut . i want to move on .
have you decided ?
yes i want to get a better job .
could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
oh that sounds terrible . would you be happier with higher pay here ? i m sure something can be worked out .
i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
yes of course . i think it 's the most important thing to me .
how much ?
how do you plan to accomplish this ?
oh that 's the warehouse . we keep a stock of the faster moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock .
well we are fully committed at the moment . may i suggest you get the goods ?
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients <unk> very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively .
what 's the price of the order ?
yes it 's said that hebes was experiencing six degree strong winds .
yes i 've heard about that . i think it 's quite a substantial idea to get a manager in the city so it 's not quite convenient for me to find a place in being interviewed .
may i ask what the matter is ?
yes . i think they should give you a few information about the offer .
but your company is fully committed at the moment and i have to cancel your reservation . you see for the 3 nights .
you get what you pay for considering the high quality our prices are very reasonable .
i think the idea is to start with . in fact i 'll have to think about it .
there are basically two types of things . we can give you a few different days and the purchase is 3 .
what do you need ?
i need to withdraw some money .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what do you mean ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
well to be honest i don t think i would like to do some things in my department .
i don t think i understand what you mean .
exactly . the software engineers are testing it just now .
yes but there is a problem with the internet . it s not a bad idea to have the problem in the library .
no really ?
yes it 's said that hebes was experiencing six degree strong winds .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
how would it be if i bought it ?
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
did you take any pictures ?
yes it is . some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
it s good to hear ! although i m wondering if you want to help me out ?
you mean kikois .
well i suppose i could learn something about business and the working conditions if i m not completely happy in order to get a free degree i may get a pay rise .
have you ever considered taking a vacation before ?
what 's the extension number ?
i 'm sorry to hear that . but i have to go somewhere with you our boss .
let me see .
why ?
not so far from a lot of work .
wow ! how much are the offseason fares ?
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .
what do you think his strengths are ?
well he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
i 'm quite active and energetic . i approach things enthusiastically and i do n't like to leave things halfdone . it makes me nervous .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
i 'm quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend in <unk> . the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
i graduated from peking university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . in my first teaching position i received the excellent teaching award the past two years in succession .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes . i was chosen as one of the top prominent youths of beijing
do you have any publications ?
yes . i have published some articles in china daily and economist .
i can speak french and german .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
no i can only carry on a simple conversation in french .
can you read and write english well ?
i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed <unk> .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .
yes . i would like to cash my travelers check . here you are .
i 'm mary kelly . may i ask your name ?
my name is b . how are you miss kelly ?
i 'm glad to meet you mr . zhuang . sit down please .
thank you miss kelly .
what are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ?
i can type 120 words a minute and i take shorthand at 80 words a minute .
would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?
yes i would .
how much ?
yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let 's go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism and this seemed like a g
right i think i m qualified for the job if i could be given the chance . while at school i once worked as parttime translator in a company and salesperson with a textile company for two years . and i do n't mind being paid less from the start i just want to enrich my experience and competence .
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes . and you also overworked in last month when steven asked for leave . i have been very satisfied with your performance . and your dependability has been a great asset .
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m 27 and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around 16 .
thank you for your kindness .
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
really ? i m very happy to hear that . why not just hold the international contacts in the united states ?
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
yes sir .
ok now some points for attention . first of all pay attention to safety . . now sign your names on the lab record and after that you can start . if there is any question just let me know .
all right who should i send them to ?
it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok home or office address ?
office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .
should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
yes it s right .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
well all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents information and other things .
what are they ?
one study said that lowincome groups have a higher percentage of overweight people than higher income families .
and what is the most important point ?
you should always remember that one customer one file is the rule .
hi this is monica . i was wondering when we can work on this financial report .
today i am busy all day long .
shall i see you on friday morning ?
that s not good for me at all . it ll have to be another time .
we must find some time to read report .
i know . i am available from 1 pm to 4 pm on friday afternoon .
that s all right . then see you on friday afternoon .
see you .
monica wait a moment . i think we d better call the repairman to do it .
i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light even during office hours i wouldn t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
other company rules also need your attention .
like this one ?
yeah thank you for telling me .
what s going to be covered in the orientation ?
the company introduction our mission vision various policies insurances pension plan company id batch telephone email setup and training .
quite a lot . all them one afternoon ?
yes it is not easy .
it is ok with me . i enjoy being busy and learning new things .
yes .
i am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 pm this thursday afternoon . please come on time .
ok thank you . by the way could you please tell me how i can get there from a community ?
oh you can take the subway get off at b stop and walk north for several minutes . you will find a building . it will take about 40 minutes in total .
i got it . thank you so much .
you are welcome .
good afternoon . my name is monica . i am here for the job interview at 2 pm .
ok please first fill in the form and return it to me . you can do it in the next door .
done . here is my paper .
everybody attention . i would like to make sure you all know the process . the interview consists of three parts . one all of the interviewees will answer the questionnaire and it lasts for maximum one hour . two we will take a 30 minute s break . after the break we all come back to this office and i will announce the successful candidates
thank you . what about the 3rd round ?
good question . but i will tell you when you pass the first two .
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?
of course i appreciate that .
well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
do you have a cold ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .
well i 'll cancel your appointments for today . and i 'll tell mr . morley .
thanks ann . talk to you this afternoon .
hope you feel better .
oh come on ! i have sixteen items ! cut me some slack will ya ?
fine ! please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through . do you prefer paper or plastic ?
plastic . i also have a couple of coupons .
no problem i ll take those . sir these coupons expired yesterday .

yeah i got a club card . here you go .

debit please . also could i get cash back ? fifty dollars would be great .
yeah sure . your total is seventyeight dollars and thirtythree cents . here is your receipt . have a nice day .
i can explain all that mr . emory would like to take a look at the meeting and get started . i can talk to you this afternoon but i m sure it ll be all right for me to you .
fine ! i ll start by working on the computer and get you to know how you can get things done .
thank you for your compliments . it s a good opportunity to work with you . but i m not sure it s nothing to do with your own stunts .
me too . do you want to make yourself some oatmeal and toast ?
i have learned some skills which i eat a lot of good computers .
that 's fine . i think your english is good .
well i studied french at school but i ve forgotten most of it . i learnt some russian while i was studying there and now i study spanish in evening classes . do you speak japanese at home with your parents ?
i left because of expiry of my current job . my current job was not interesting . i think i am fit for the job because i want to seek better jobs .
great . we will make great efforts to meet you in the future .

that s no problem .
do you have any other questions ?
yes . maternity leave is mentioned in the contract but there s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . do you offer anything to fathers ?

i set up the personal wealth management service with you but i 'm going to be travelling overseas . i 'm not quite sure what i should do . i mean is it possible to still use the service ?
when ?
i do n't need my id .
for members there are various kinds of tools such as the card number of the person you want . do you know your card ?
here you are .
it 's 1 australian dollars for adults and 20 rib .
all right . here 's 20 .
we will pay with cash .
i think i want to pay 2000 yuan into my account .
does that include the insurance ?
ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest of small changes please .
right it should be done in a few minutes .
thank you . how much is it ?
you too .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for a full hour in the cold wind .
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
i ve been working really hard lately . how about you ?
so what would you say about the balance ?
i 'm in pretty bad shape doctor .
how many diners will be in your group ?
i 'm sorry but it is our regulation so we can exchange it to you .
do you know how to do a gift ?
i m not going to be able to afford any more .
wow ! that 's too bad ! i thought i was going to go out all the way !
did you have a good journey ?
i 'm glad you 're making a great bid . i 'm sure you could go down to line for a few days .
don t worry . i ll just check .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
i know you are right . anyway the government has a lot of money to save money .
that 's it my lease is up .
sounds like you are baking too . what else did you order ?
it s not too bad . are you aware of that ?
well if you refuse to take a break you can t make the decision by making a decision .
sure what do you need to do there ?
i 'm having some trouble . how do you use this printer ?
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yes . i would like a pair of black leather shoes in size 25 .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .
please input your 6 digit pin code followed by the pound key . thank you . please select an option . thank you . you have selected withdrawal .
yeah yeah i know what i selected . just gimme my money !
calm down ! shouting won t help ?
no no ! stupid machine what are you doing ! no !
confirmed . thank you for using our bank ! please remove your card from the slot . goodbye !
one hundred and fifty yuan .
how about a trial order ? would you give us a discount ?
the quantity you ordered is much smaller than those of others .
it s a little bit chilly on this price . can i suggest that you put it on a basis ?
so our discount is no big than we can afford .
how about coming down to your price ?
yeah that s a good idea . you know i could still get some pretty good furniture .
yes it 's already fifty yuan off the original price .
