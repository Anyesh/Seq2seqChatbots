about half an hour .
well i think you 'd better have a look at the internet .

in this afternoon .
i would like to come in on that day .
yeah . i just bought new house .

i guess so .
yes please tell him that you called .
ok i 'll take a message .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
what would you like to order ?
we have several colors to choose from . which country do you like ?
it feels good .
that 's reasonable .

that 's good . now can i use the key to get it ?
yes i have the right to go .
i know . i have to travel a lot .
yes i am after some sugar .
what 's the difference ?
i think that i might work for it .
ok . let 's go over there .
sure . how about this one ?
i am afraid the fashion is too small for me .
ok . i 'll pick you up at six thirty .
may i have your name ?
thank you .
it 's on the second floor .
it 's on the right hand side of the aisle .
do they are small ?
right .
i 'd like to have a steak sandwich and a medium fry .
do you want anything to drink ?
coffee please .
is this dinein or takeout ?
but i will be able to save money in a couple of dollars .
are you ready to order ?
i will take it .
i 'm hungry . i 'd like to eat something .
i love apple pie too .
yes i 'd like a glass of iced tea .
how would you like your coffee ?
no you re right .
well i had to wait until your office got home . i had a lot of work to do on this .
no i 'm afraid not .
thank you .
no problem .
then what 's the difference between the and the factory ?
let me see . . . at 615 am local time tomorrow .
how about saturday ?

i want a beer .
well first of all we need a few kinds of beverages in economy . i d also like to have some rest .
that 's a good idea . shall we meet at the bar ?
good evening . my wife and i would like a room please . is there any room available ? we do n't have a reservation .

here is the money .
thank you . have a nice day .
i would like to speak to you the perfect table .
right . and she 's so funny .
turn right at the second light and you will see it on your left .
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
i knew i could have gone to the airport and got back .
what do you need ?
thanks a lot .
hi tom ! it 's good to see you again .
certainly sir . enjoy your stay here .
i 'll look for it .
just go to the lake and turn left onto center .
ok i 'll be right back .
if you agree to pay more money you could upgrade the carpet .
can i move it right now ?
i 'm sorry sir it 's <unk> .
i 'll be back in a minute .
i am sorry . there is no extra room for any hot water
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
i would like to return an item .
yes we do . it 's a very popular thing to go with some men .
how many nights a week is it ?
i want to transfer 100 .
can i pay by card ?
no problem . when you come to the shop you can get what you like to do .
i knew i could have gone to the airport and got back .
what do you need ?
oh well that 's just a few minutes walk to the street . turn left at the traffic light and you 'll see it .
is it far ?
i think a cab is better .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
sure . here you are .
i want to try a new hairstyle . what do you think ?
well . cantonese food is rather light beijing food is heavy and sichuan food is usually hot and spicy .
it 's hard to say . but i think i 'll take it .
i want a large one . i want a smaller one .
you have a very good point . you should be in a particular brand you like .
it 's fine . i will take it .
yes we do . we consider a lot of business with you .

thank you for telling me that . i 'll be back later .
excuse me ?
just bring them back to the circulation desk and send them to my bedroom .
i would like to cancel one of my accounts .
yes . what size do you take ?
no i do n't think the blue dress is good too .
you 're right . i love it very much .
i do n't like the design but i need to save up .
yes but it 's the first time i am experienced in the mirror .

no i did n't .
i have never tasted anything like it .
that 's right mutton chops taste so good we eat them with sauce have you ever tried ?
yes i have i tried them when i visited your country last year i think they were very tasty . can you cook them ?
i certainly can . if i can get some from the butcher s i ll cook them for you .
that sounds great . i 'll bring a bottle of wine .

just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . . .
what about this one ? it 's a very dress . it 's very smart .
what 's the memory ?
it s a traditional chinese language .
i understand .
hmm . i think it 's a good idea to see an oral train .
ok . i 'll take it right now .
yes i 'm ready .
are you ready to transfer tomorrow ?
i 'm sorry .
do you love me ?
that 's interesting .
i 'll give you five more minutes then i 'm going on without you !

i only paid two dollars .
i think i 'll take it .
yes it does .
yes i m . are you a good exercise ?

i 'll have a tomato juice and some iced tea .

you 're welcome .
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
that would be great . how much is it ?

that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk and sugar with your tea ?
i want a large pan of sugar .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh i see . well i guess i 'll take it easy .
it 's the truth . i do n't think we can be able to find a place to live . it 's been a pleasant place for the summer .
i see . well i can help with the chores while i m here . you two could probably use my help .
that s very kind of you to offer . here s your tea . be careful it s still quite hot .
the bus doesn t go there directly . you can take the subway to the traffic lights .
thank you . how long do i have to stay there ?

you can take the shuttle to the transfer station at the next stop .
sure . go straight ahead and you 'll walk into it .
oh i see . thank you .
oh you can take it here .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just want to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that 's a lot of money . how about that one over the counter ?
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing .
that s even better than the real thing .
if you are not thin you ll need to take a heavy bag .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
sure . the fitting room is over there .
yes i 'd like to buy a walkman . can you tell me about the models you have ?
this is kevin .
yes . i have to stay in bed for three days and i 'll cook .
you 'd better get some rest .

she 's in the hospital with my dad .
yes . how long does she take ?
i m flying home on sunday afternoon .
i like secondhand products . i want to get a discount on expensive price .
yes .
well you d better get up or you ll be late because the hotel is closed so you can pick up your prescription from the doctor .
ok ! i would like to have it dry cleaned .
but you are so <unk> !
seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars !

i think you 'll like the food there .

no thank you . that 's it .
how do you want your eggs ?
one coke and the other a sprite please .

ok . i want your name and address .
i 'll take care of the order .
yeah i like shopping in a mall but i do n't have to worry about it .
i think the biggest environment problem for a person we should do it .
that 's right . in china is a general center of china .
that 's something that you really need to work on .
it 's from the musical that was made in our last two years . it was the best seller in beijing .
i m a good accountant and i think i m good at this school .
they are all good but they are not very fashionable .
i want to try on this pair .
do you have a pattern in your mind ?
and what sports do you like best ?
i think it 's a very good thing that you like .
i agree how much ?
you just said it .
yes i 'd like a glass of iced tea .
how about a cup of coffee ?
it sounds good . i 'd like to start with a compare .
stirred or shaken ?
stirred will be fine .
here you are .
thank you .

it sounds interesting . i 'll take one .
here 's the latest model digital barbie .
how much do i owe you ?
if you really want to go to the next corner you are .
yeah .
i 'll try .
i do n't like hamburgers . they are too hot . they are allowed to make the <unk> whatever you want .
it 's a letter from ray and sue in shanghai !
i think you 're a bit optimistic . they are enough for you .
how do you make it ?
are you kidding me ?
they 're soft delicious .
i think the coffee is a good choice .
so you 're just going to do it ?
what 's it about ?
i 'd like to order a bottle of champagne lobster tail and filet mignon medium rare .
it could be that or maybe you are eating too many sweets . in any case i ll administer an anesthetic and you won t feel a thing !
oh no . you can see that we are famous for its beautiful scenery .
blah . . . what 's that ?
ok . i will get it done right away .
what do you mean by that ?
you 're welcome .
it 's really great .
so do you think you can make it ?
how much is it ?
i think the guest is <unk> by its style . in fact i 'd like to go to the united states . you see it 's a tradition from my home .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you ?
i am calling to let you know that you are expected to come for an interview in our branch .
which room are you in ?
i am in room 205 . my name is bill smith . when shall i check out ?
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
i 'd like a pair of black leather shoes .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
i think she is really a man of slim .
is she like you ?
what did she do ?
do n't worry about it . i 'm sure you 'll have half an open class .
i 'm very sorry for the delay . i 'll check immediately and call you back .
well i have got your name and phone number .
how about your family ?
and the delay is too high for us to finish it .
are you scared of anything ?
let me have a check . oh there are two glasses of orders .
what 's your problem ?
what would you like for your appetizer sir ?
that 's a good idea . let 's go to the hotel and buy some new air .
would you like to order a large amount of 100 ?
i know i know .
you mean we can make it ?
it 's a taiwanese puppet doll .
you wo n't be late . it 's still early .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your size .
why ?
you know i really should go tomorrow .
ok . i 'll take two bottles .
yeah . let 's just go .
no i m afraid not .
what about next ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
i see . and would you like to have dinner with me ?
no thank you .
i will try my best to do it but you should let the internet go and make it to your room .
would you like a different color carpet ?
i do n't know . she must be deaf .
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's only about 10 minutes walk .
that 's very clear . i see . thank you .
you 're welcome .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you 're right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
look at this mountain bike . it is only 330 . do you like it ?
hello this is mr . wang in room 1305 . please send up a boy to help me with my luggage .
that s usual nowadays . you ve added a few shelves too .
i wrote the check out for way too much .
yeah it 's nice . thanks for bringing the sauce .
i know . maybe i should go and look in the kitchen .
of course . please put your name and i ll also need your help out .
great ! i ll be glad to help you with that .
do you have your zone card ?
well i ve been waiting to sit down and let me know if you re interested .
i 'm sorry but i ca n't find it . would you mind checking for me ?

why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?

i 'd like a cup of bean pie .

chinese dishes are exquisitely prepared delicious and very good . they are very good in colour <unk> and taste .

it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .

hi . it s tony calling from the dentist s office . is lily there ?
you 're speaking with a tie to go home .
thank you . this is your bill . if you need anything just dial 0 .
yes i 'm . what 's up ?
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
that 's no problem .
see you .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is . i 'm looking for a onebedroom apartment .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
when do you expect him back ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
i m glad to hear that .
yes it 's a really simple place to do . besides you want to describe the city life there . for example it 's really convenient for people to clean up the street and the street .
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars a week .
well i 'm very interested in the job .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
you really should be right . by the way do you think it s going to be a good one ?
i am thinking about getting a new one .
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
do you always go to work after school ?
you 're right .
where did he go ?
he was late again . he took the train remember ?
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
you are right . we should be talking about him .
yeah you should n't be so negative . he is always busy with his work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never been to florida ?
it 's because of the great things here in the museum . everybody is getting into a happy birthday party .
hello paul .
wow ! my family is a little sick .
it 's probably nice talking to you . i 'm going to have a great time .
i am doing great .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
it 's great ! it 's been a long time .
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
good luck to you .
thank you for all your help .
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i have been working here for 5 years .
quite a lot .
she 's a lot like me . she 's always busy .
what do you think of a man ?
i 'm sorry sir . i know it 's a really good time to watch a movie .
that 's a good idea . he used to be a policeman .
what ? you 're so excellent .
ok . i 'll be there .
i 'll be there .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we have . we are not the best one to bring up . what do you want ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
yes now many people in your shop what are looking for in a larger area ? now in the collar it 's a pretty heavy item especially for young people .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
yes ! when you put your money in the bank and we ll issue you with a bank !
you can t take me there ! you can t just kiss me like this !
i can t believe it ! what are you getting ?
what 's the cause of gas ?
when ? do you want to go to the gym ?
i guess i 'm not . look i these two things .
i can read the book you or something like that .
there are some kind of virus i mean . i had to put it in the kitchen .
yes . i am looking for a sweater .
are you looking for a small camera ?
i ll take a small one . i need a small percentage of this camera .
what s your camera ?
quite a lot . if you want the first one that goes well with the certificate of each g and the total amount of <unk> .
oh you do n't have to do that . it 's a dutyfree shop .
thank you very much .
that s great . and for a little more than the chinese one . that s the biggest problem .
it does n't work . i 'm getting too cold and it s pretty late .
i can buy that mp s to buy an inexpensive camera .
here 's your ticket and change . . .
i can do that .
what 's it like living in a friendly house ?
i 'm sorry . but i think you 'd better try something else .
i m sorry to hear that .
here i know a business card and this is the best card for you .
i think so too .
no problem .
i 'd like to have a double cheeseburger .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no chicken breasts at all .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
no thank you .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
what s the problem ?
mmm . . . no that s all right . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to return this item .
do you like them have dancing figures ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
that s the best part . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i m sure that s a good idea . but i don t want any children .
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
i said this is a lovely day . why do you join us ?
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
you mean i will try this red wine then ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
ok here 's the key . you can get a drink .
no it just wo n't work . i 'll read for your exam .
that 's great . thanks for your support .
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you .
but she said she was n't so sure .
hello . i 'm here to talk to you about my credit card .
yes of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
yes you re lucky . you ve got to be professional and honest . you re starting to get a new one .
awesome !
yes .
no way !
this is a very good idea to hear from you . it s a very good idea to put a face on your hands when you can see the red dress code and then find it .
the carpet and the floor is so beautiful . i wish it were all good . there were a lot of historical exhibits in this world .
great ! good luck to you !
it would be the best choice .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i agree . look in this pan . it s a very expensive pan but it s in good shape .
what size do you wear ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . you re already prequalified for your dollars .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
yeah . and there 's a walkin closet .
not really . just leave it to me .
is it very cold in winter ?
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s a very good idea to have a good idea of the perfect issue .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
i could have a few more minutes . i d really like to get a new one .
i have n't thought of that .
yes it has two bedrooms . that 's convenient .
i like the style but i want to thank you very much .
it s only 725 a month .
that s way too much .
what are you going to buy ?
i really don t like it .
that s not a problem .
thank you very much .
that s not a problem .
i think a chinese student <unk> on written english and uses it as a basis for communicating . from start to finish he s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . this is a very difficult way to learn .
i m not sure if i can .
i love it . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . it gives me a real sense of satisfaction . do you enjoy cooking ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and cutlery away .
you can have some water . i ll put the cup up and put the cup up . i ll just have to put the cup up and put it on the washing up .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah i know . i buy most of the things i bought from america last year . it 's so much fun . i can never knew it .
i think 2000 would be enough for me to do all this for today .
very well . do you want your supplies ?
i really like the red one .
the color i use now is natural beige . how much do you think it would cost ?
i do n't want to hear about this . i can assure you that a product is a little more expensive than this one .
don t worry . i ll just buy you a new one tomorrow .
hey i play basketball with you . it s too hard to do .
then i might as well put on a black suit . and this is the best seller in china .
i like the black one . what 's the fashional color this year ?
how long do you want to pay ?
the bigger one .
thank you . i think you will find the perfect sweater for you .
i am going to put it on your clothes too .
speaking .
i am mr . stephen s secretary . i have a job job job job job job .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i am not sure .
i will try to find one for you .
fine . i 'll be expecting you .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
yes we are over there . can you see me now ?
yes i 'll look forward to seeing you .
thank you .
no but i only need to check your driver 's license .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
oh thank you . i 'm just looking forward to it .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it has great curb appeal .
let s rock and roll band 6 .
you can t just rent it for two weeks .
i think so . are you sure ?
do you have a balcony ?
it looks good on the way to the bathroom .
it s a bit of a problem .
i like it too . let s make it a trial .
as far as i know them are about 10 or nine people .
i was thinking of getting a different dress . it is very cheap and it has a great time .
i can t wait to see it .
in the meantime do i still have to pay for it ?
which antivirus program would i use ?
it 's a bit strange for being put in the suburbs . it 's a bit chilly in here .
wow this place is so beautiful for me . i love the design and bright .
i thought it might be a good idea to join the top .
thank you .
that s what i m looking for .
this is he . what can i do for you ?
hello may i help you ?
oh where are you going to live ?
i 'd love to but i 'm afraid that i ca n't .
let 's see .
no i m afraid i have to go now .
i know you have a tight schedule so i wo n't take it with me .
ok . i 'll see you there .
you have a very good view .
thank you .
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
yes i 'd like to buy a walkman . can you tell me about the models you have ?
well you could have thought of an interesting interview . you know you can get a good deal .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
that 's good . could you tell me how to get to the book ?
well i hate to say this . . .
yes .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
yes it is . it 's very hard to find a job in shanghai .
could you tell me something about it ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
i 'm not the person who committed that crime .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
that 's a good idea . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
oh i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
i guess i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're welcome . goodbye .
how would you like your hair cut ?
yes my name is ms jane reeve reeve reeve reeve it says mr . anderson !
i 'd like to but i have to finish it .
i want a shampoo but a little extra will do .
well . i think the red sweater is not very good at ?
no problem . i think it 's a little tight in the waist .
what your short already sir .
i hope so . i 'm really tired of this oldfashioned style that i 've been wearing .
i think you can help me on the job . if i have ever been there i 'll have to go over the phone .
no you do n't . it 's a dutyfree shop . we 'll give you a refund .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
no i do n't .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
no way . i did n't mean to put things on . i need all of this .
i agree . and with you .
i 'll just have to pay for it .
it 's all right . just go and check the connections .
oh thanks a lot . that 's really nice of you .
yes we have a 1000 service charge .
the available of this month is very good .
all right . you 're all set . please enjoy your drink sir .
why is that ?
do you mind if i move your job ?
what do you mean ?
where is it ?
i want to go to a really light house in the kitchen next to it .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
where is it ?
yes we do . we did have a lot of improvement in advertising . it s very popular .
yes i work in a public office .
where is it ?
how long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?
where is that ?
it would be very expensive to live in .
where is it ?
did you get the goods on the market before you go to the beach ?
i have to see my daughter .
where is it ?
i think it s because of the fine things in this country .
if you 're not busy do you think we can find a place to live nearby ?
great ! i hope you can do it tomorrow .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
what would you like to do ?
i 'd rather have some chinese food .
yes . i like chinese food .
i 'm still hungry .
i hope i can do it .
i like the fish .
sure ! it 's a place to eat chinese food . do you want to go to the seafood restaurant ?
i have n't decided yet . i usually just listen to pop music to the radio .
do you like chinese food ?
thank you .
what do you think of our local restaurant ?
you mean sweet taste .
you 'll see . it 's good for you . . . . well i think you 'll be getting more relaxed . . .
many things here are different places . for example is your shop a little bookstore where you can find your place to be located .
that 's very kind of you helen . i hope you can do better tomorrow .
what are the things that i need to buy ?
oh i guess i must have invited him to dinner . do we need to have our first ?
no . just tell me your name and contact number .
oh i see . who s calling ?
you 're welcome .
it 's a great idea .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
it 's the best choice i can do .
i know . but i still have to go back to other companies .
what time do you close please ?
do you mean the red things ? they are roses .
i was hoping to get something on sale today .
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
i want to buy some from my son .
i 'm afraid i can t but i 've got a list of things .
it 's a good idea . why do n't you tell me about it ?
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
yes i know that . those are the ones that i came to make . but they were not as tasty as the ones in the city .
yes . her company is a very famous soft and a hard job .
good . i want to know if you can do it .
it 's 10 yuan a day but if you do n't mind it 's free to pay you for the next bus .
how much do you spend on design then ?
ok . i 'll get them for you .
yes i 'd like to buy a walkman . can you tell me about the models you have ?
do you have the receipt ?
here you go .
is it expensive ?
i want to return it to school .
i 'll go and get all the groceries for tonight . you can look nice in this year .
i guess i could take a look .
i 'd like to reserve one for you .
how much do you want to order ?
i see . well i guess i can help you with that .
well i have to pay it . here is the money .
i 'm afraid we cannot help you any longer than a beginner . i really need to know about that .
i hope so .
i 'd be glad to . you see i 'm in a position to give you the best regards to mrs . brown who i think of your company will be coming to you in tomorrow morning .
here you are .
thank you .
well . . . i guess i 'll be able to put the items in this near the card .
if you need to buy anything else please do n't hesitate to let me know .
sure go ahead .
i think you can give me some advice . you have worked here longer and i just want to know what you think .
do i have any other choices ?
could you anything else ?
anything else ?
oh o . k . where s a school school ?
i guess you are right . but the chinese firework is not a great opportunity for me . so i have to spend all the time .
i know what you mean . i would never want to eat a big dragon boat race and think that 's enough !
come on ! my house is brand new so i set it up the kitchen and i like it now !
come on ! in this afternoon i ll just put the dishes on the side and get it !
how about the umbrella ? it 's very quiet in the morning . it was very beautiful .
no i 'm not . everything 's just for me and everything is perfect .
i have no idea what i want .
no i 'll do that .
yes i like it very much .
that 's not exactly ! that 's a little personal ! with all this personal banker i can also get a 'ii 'ii score of some up .
once i make it to cook .
yeah that s a good idea ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
fortunately for me . i am on the diet .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like . classical music might make you clever but dance might make you livelier and happier .
well i ve only finished making dishes for lunch and then i ll bring them back to you .

you 've got it ! but are you sure you 'll be back by tomorrow ?

i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'd love to go out for a hike .
i could teach you how to cook something healthy .
i know i know . but i 'm not good at it !
i think you 'll enjoy the food there .
yeah why not ? it 's good to have the ingredients . it 's very romantic to make sure you do n't have to worry about the food there .
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !

i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?

i agree . but my husband would get to work on the car . it 's just so convenient .
but the parking might be .
do you have a car ?
no but i do n't have a car .
maybe i should go to the store too . it 's only about getting a day .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !

i can t do that .
how long will the tour take ?
i know . but it 's going to be a lot of fun .

you mean you 're right ?

i m excited to be here .
i 'll have to go to university .
you 're going to take courses ?
no i 'm not . i 'm too sure i 'll have the time .

i see . i 'll buy you a new one .
not at all . i m really excited about it .
yes i 'd like to look at some suits .
what can i do for you ?
oh it 's written by howard sounds .
it 's an action movie and you have to be an expert on it .

i m sorry but you can t take the test again .
i had no idea that the goods was n't <unk> with my bathroom and you just have to be more careful than the rest of the day .
how about next time we meet at my place ? and i ll treat you to chinese food . i know how much you like it . we can order in and watch video too . anything you like i promise .
yeah . it s been a long time !
really ? it was great ! it really went a lot of hours and it got to the department store .
mmmm . . . how about the little term of time ?
yes . and i also meet him at the airport .
i 've been watching a movie the other day . i just got to know what 's up .
that 's a relief .
i 'll give you a call tonight .
i see . . . what do you think of the greatest time ?
yes . i 'm just a few years ago . i want to take the course in my writing .

how can you tell the difference ? from what i see the advantages of how much we can give you a low price .
i really love this !
you bet .
where is my office ?
well first of all it s an excellent thing to tell the educational background and experience .
well first of all it s easy . first of all the secret to a successful oral presentation is to be honest with a professional oral presentation . usually it lasts a long time and you can be <unk> .
that 's true ! guess it does n't have to work at a regular world !
of course . they are the very latest fashion now . but it 's a little expensive to go .
well i guess i am not so sure about that .
you might want to know about it ?
then i might as well have them made .
i 'm fine celia . and you ?
i m ok . i m so busy !
do you have a lot of homework ?
yes .
of course i do !
let s think this through . first of all you cannot leave amy at the altar . not only will she be humiliated and kill you but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? second of all you are just getting cold
i m studying for my chemistry exam tomorrow .
are you in mrs . green s class ?
yes . are you ?
i will be voting tomorrow .
do you want to study together ?
yes i do .
do you want to go to an empty classroom ?
that sounds good .
yes it is the best of our hotel .
oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
i agree with you but he is always busy .
yes . he 's strict with himself too .
you can transfer fuchengmen .
you mean that ? are you kidding ? you 've been friends ?
it 's on the 7th floor .
ok . i 'll make sure and come back in a couple of minutes .
hum me too . this winter holiday holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i 've got a really bad headache and my stomach hurts .

you know what . the theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play . they are supposed to call me this evening . if i do n't have a phone . oh what can i do ?
oh is it ?
yes this is the best we can do .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i suppose i 'm going to try to get a new position in the future .
i understand your point .
do you have any plans for a whole week ?
i remember that . to tell me the truth was very poor i did not think about it . i would be able to work any work experience in a company so i am familiar with the companies .
what ? what ? what is it ?
i think it s the thing that we can do during the day .
what ? what ?
that s good service . do you think i am using the kind of stuff like that ?
i think you re right . i think that is true but i just for the moment i m looking for a more practical .
do you think you really know that you are a very serious person ?
i 'm ok .
no problem .
i would like to return this book .
what do you need ?
i need to take a driver 's course .
have you checked the periodicals section yet ?
i didn t even bother to think of that .
i know . it s a most important thing to me .
i saw the tea house the other day .
do you want me to give you a ride ?
thank you very much .
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
it s just the same with the regular price . and there s something we can do .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it s hard to say . it depends on the right hand and the younger kids .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada and the usa are huge too .
why do you say so ?
there are a lot of lakes and rivers in my country too . we also have some small islands but there are many small islands too .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to cancel one of my accounts .
is that all ?
i have it .
thank you . please fill out this form .
i understand how to pay .

no problem .
that 's all right . you should do it in the couple of days .
i 'm very sorry mr . bob . there has been a mistake .
here 's a twenty .
i do n't think it 's too difficult to tell the truth . the postage is very high .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your size .
you 're kidding . the last piece of cake was n't very good .
yes . but she is much better than the bus .
please hold on a second .
let 's make it the first thing for me .
i know a lot of people wouldn t like to be able to make it .
i 'm not sure which one you want .
that 's right . try it on .
sure company rules are not very strict at this point .
but whether you like it or not there s a trend of lifelong study to make sure that we can keep ourselves up with the high developing society . and you need to accept this concept positively .
do n't worry about it . the shipping costs and the insurance policy is included in both time . we will manage to change the safe size of the items .
yes it is . but i ve got a lot of work too .
that 's the last straw that happens when i work .
i think housing is a better way to go for both .
i think you 'd better speak english though .
no i think it is just a good idea .
i want you to get one for me right now .
all right .
they 're due today .
i guess so .
here 's the money .
any other hand ?
i really appreciate you helping me with this .
actually i 'm a little better . i 've been doing great .
all right . in all you have to pay attention to the gross weight .
my husband is on the very <unk> street .
i still think nobody plays for nothing .
it 's a quarter to the 8 . i am sure we can do it .
so i can keep going to wear black and black shoes ?
how about a china vase ?
that should n't be a problem . i 'm sure you will be there .
if we start from a few weeks i 'll be starting next week .
i like english .
you mean i have to finish this report ?
yes she 's a <unk> for my birthday .
thank you .
i think they are very good . i can do whatever you want .
i need to finish my paper . i 'll be on monday and thursday .
just make sure to put out the pepper and salt shakers . i don t know if your brother is coming tonight so set an extra place mat just in case .
that should n't be a problem .
first you put your money in the slot or the coin slot . the simplest thing is to be general .
uh . . . yeah . . . well please . . . there 's a lot to do .
well i want to become a professor in the future .
why do you want to do that ?
yes i like it very much . however it 's a little too heavy . i 'm afraid i have to say my english is too strong .
do n't worry . you 'll be a little better soon .
i think they are very simple . i can do many things in the first thing .
what are you going to major in ?
do n't worry i can manage it myself . i 'm always getting behind the schedule .
i think you should go to the library . it s very exciting .
i need to return a book .
may i do anything else for you ?
i sure do .
what ?
yes i would .
i ll get them for you at once .
do i have to send one by email ?
now i 've got you .
here you are .
you re a real pal . let s talk to our clients . i ll see you then .
i appreciate it .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
you did but i tried to prevent it from being stolen .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
that 's a great relief for him . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
they always say that dogs are not very happy about the world .
i don t want to leave him like this .
good boy . i will tell him how .
i know . he would never give up the good work .
but i like its color .
what about this one ? it 's the latest design .
i 'm very happy to hear that . here 's the dressing room .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to my liking too .
what kind of teaching certificate would you like ?
it 's my dream .
i have n't even heard of it .
it 's great !
why ? he s so good at the end of this month .
why do n't you go to bed and get up early ?
i lost a man and he s so good . i m glad we shared each other .
wow you have a lot of sense of humor . i love being in the countryside . there s a lot of stylish italian restaurants in my city .
yes it is .
i hope you have a pleasant stay here .
no your computer might have been just a couple of weeks ago . you ve been living too busy !
do you have the bank card ?
hello mr . sandals . i 'm just calling to confirm the date of your corporation . is that true ?
that s good to know . it seems she can do well in the library .
well trains are frequent and come on time .
it s a good idea to do more to relieve stress .
it must be amazing to do things with her .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes ?
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
really ? i thought he was a little better .
what ? you 're just a little rundown .
wow like what ?
my wallet and cell phone .
oh that 's all right . it looks like you were very kind of you .
why are you acting up to me ?
i 'm from america . are you settling in all ?
you know on a date they are going to come out to the department and enjoy a dinner together .
when did you go to the magic kingdom ?
right here . see the scratch ?
it 's all right . but we 'll have to wait for another one .
you know what this is ? why do n't you try and give it a try ?
yeah .
thank you . it s a bit tight .
i will bring it .
a dozen will be fine .
exactly what ?
you 'd better be a neat freak .
i heard she 's in love with my dad .
you are in luck .
how about the new product ?
i 'm steven . i 'm here to see your passport .
i can t afford about that .
let 's say about 600 ?
she 's the one who saved the life of my son at the beach last year .
i 'm waiting for her call .
she 's a friend of amy .
certainly . when will we know if she 's interested in the personnel department ?
i like she 's very nice .
well you 're really mary . i 'm sure you 'll be with me . oh here 's my card .
i feel sorry for her .
i do n't think that she 's that strongminded .
no i didn t . i wanted to go but my daughter s birthday . she said she and i want to go there too .
it 's kind of a big favor . i 'm absolutely flat broke and i owe my landlady 200 . she 's given me until friday to give it to her but i do n't get paid until next monday .
this is kevin .
i 'll have to go and get it right now .
i think you 've got the right thing .
oh i see . but we 'd better go to the doctor 's and have one more thing .
what 's it look like lady ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in is n't it ?
if you were hired when he was a young man i would be a boy .
this is not what i asked for .
and what 's more these years of eating ?
that 's terrible . i 'm sorry .
i 'll see you then .
no i have n't . i 'm too excited to be able to move it .
my boss told me that my friend had an important meeting to do and i should have some chores to do .
i do n't know . i never bought them .
yes it 's out of my name .
hmm . . . well what 's this ?
that 's not a problem . what should i do ?
i know but i was upset . i should have been there too much .
he is a young man . he loves football .
you 're right . he 's very handsome and handsome .
first you need to keep winning the election .
it 's on the right bus to have a taste for never one .
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's right . i 'm just kidding .
i 'm so sorry . did you think of something ?
i 'm the same with you . i 'm just thinking of dropping out .
the security door is very crowded and you can see that they 're already terribly small .
yes it 's not too bad . at all i expected to meet a family there .
so what did you do ? i did n't think of it . thank you for your help .
and she was so unhappy too . i appreciate her and simply can go to the beach together .
but we 'd better not find someone anywhere .
yes . fortunately she was an excellent student .
great ! i will definitely take it .
well i do n't think it 's that bad .
that 's great . i 'll take care of it .
what 's your plan ?
it 's 1000 o 'clock .
but we ca n't have thirteen for dinner !
yes . that 's right .
that sounds really good . let 's go !
he is really outrageous .
just a minute . i think i 'll go get my shopping cart .
and what about your old one ?
that 's right ! then you just press the button and turn left .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
no i was way .
here is the money .
no .
i 'm sure we will have .
i will try my best to help you .
i do n't think so . i 'm quite a bit confused .
you really did n't have a very traditional wedding did you ?
yes . you 're going to have to throw in the stone .
that 's ok .
what was that ? ? ? ? ? ? last one . . . ? ? . . ? ? . . ?
you re absolutely right .
i love it ! i could use some good luck !
that 's great . i hope you can make it .
it 's a kind of rice ball that is made in malaysia . what about you ? it 's a special location for the job .
i see . so the basic difference between the two parties and the deductibles are the same as in taiwan .
yes . hey i like the sound of stepping on the snow very much .
that 's nice . you can wait for a second . there 's a large concert hall and a name .
i 'm a student .
here 's your receipt .
i 'm very much better than you .
no thank you . it s very kind of you .
i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . i 'm waiting for the inconvenience .
yes but let me get some ketchup .
hello . i 'd like to know about the balance of the interest rate .
good morning miss white .
i think i will like it .
we hope you are settling in in in the future .
i would like to rent a car with a credit rating of your credit rating must be paid at the current deposit and the interest rate of payment .
is she really ? i can t believe it !
yes . yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
no . i m serious .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but if you do have to pay for it .
come on ! don t be silly !
all right just a quick one .
well the government has some financial problems . people there are all thinking of quitting .
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
i think it 's time to go and get that .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
it 's alright . you are a good catch .
what a pity !
it does n't matter .
ho no !
it 's still early .
do n't stay up late .
i 'm afraid we have to wait for the next bus .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
you re absolutely right .
yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
i have to see my daughter .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she 's 42 .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you 're right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
great ! i bet you 're hungry !
good . let 's go now .
look at the snow it s so beautiful .
it was me . i am so sorry .
i have to write you a ticket and suspend your driver 's license for 3 months .
i think it is amazing . you can enjoy both the traditional chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . the only thing i did n't enjoy was the subway .
i 'm afraid that 's too bad . i do n't think i 'm going to have any problem .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i 'm so sorry .
i do n't want to .
well come and talk to me then .
certainly not .
thank you .
turn on the radio ? what for ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to the music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
what time is it ?
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
what a nuisance !
it 's ten minutes now .
i just stayed at home and watched tv .
are you worried about anything ?
of course .
i would like to cancel one of my accounts .
you know i often have to work far into the night . i 'm a night owl anyway .
i need to go to the dentist .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . it was really a shame that i did n't catch you .
no that 's enough .
how about this one ? it 's very good .
i want to create a password for this document . please tell me how to do it .
well i 've noticed you have some points to follow . what do you think of this one ?
it 's fantastic .
you 're welcome .
ok .
here you are .
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
well thank you .
coffee please .
what ?
yes i do .
thank you .
not today .
yes . there is a bank nearby it 's not too expensive to carry .
this one fits me well but it 's too expensive .
i wish it was n't but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
hello i 'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh i see .
i 'm too nervous .
i am really sorry to hear that .
well . i really wanted to see you .
do you have to pay to go to school tomorrow ?
that s terrible . i don t know anyone else could afford that .
i think you 've got a cold .
oh that 's easy .
well i hope they re not too hard to believe this . i really want to get going .
i see .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what ? my car does n't have it !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid not . but we are going to have to take a taxi .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
not too bad thanks a lot . i want to know how i can do this .
i m sorry i have to go to the airport to pick up some relative .
it s ok . i hope you can do it .
all right . thank you . and have you ever tried giving me the best ones ?
you know that i care for you . i want you to know that i care for you .
do n't you think it 's a boy who looks like you 're a boy ?
you think ?
yes i do .
so are you going to go and see a movie ?
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
oh thanks . it s a long way to go .
really ?
thanks .
that will probably take about four hours . so we should get there before around 30 .
yes look at my resume . i think i do n't want to be late for work .
you 're not going to be late ?
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
i think you are a quick learner .
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important thing i can explain it to you . if you are n't <unk> it will be a just that you will find a profitable market .

well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time you see gay marriage .

yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
i 'm so sorry to hear that .
i need to go to the dentist .
you can never tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know . i will do it . then i will ask my friend to call you .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and and and and and and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you think that many people will be happy to share the same thing with you ?
i have n't seen you for ages .
it 's a taiwanese puppet doll .
i was also interested in the singer but i was very excited about it .
i would n't have been so nervous ! i just want to be a little better .
i work for the bank of china in the international section .

well you can bet this relationship s going to be a flash in the pan .
it 's so total 's for sure .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . but this is maybe it 's not my fault .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it 's just one of those things .
you do ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
you can do it .
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
i do n't think i know what you mean .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what would you like to have ?
yes i think i 'm going to have a baby .

it s not a surprise .
it 's far quicker and less complicated .
oh i guess that 's what i thought . why do n't we go outside and have our lunch together ?
look at the flowers over there .
that sounds like a good idea .
i m very sorry to hear that .
come on . put the gun down .
no . i 'm already in a meeting .
of course not !
i like figured myself .
that 's really a shame . do you want to go to celebrate my job ?
your plane tickets are valid for three years .
and i 'm so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn t truly worthy .
thanks . now i think it 's a success all right ?
i know . it 's a good thing to be home .
it 's a taiwanese puppet doll .
i am going to be late .
i don t know . it s a lovely country .
good .
i 've made a mistake .
what do you mean janice ?
i just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking . it s so lonely and boring . my sickness makes it worse . when will i recover ?
then tell me what you want to do .
i know . i 'm really sorry .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . . .
i only have a couple of children .
now you 're talking .
good . how about you ?
sure that 's a quarter to 12 .
i 'll look for it .
thank you . which gate should i go to for the bus ?
you 're welcome .
maybe we should just wait for the next bus .
yes .
and about time too !
yes it is . that 's why it 's so quiet .
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
i love the car . it 's so beautiful . i wish it were a bit too cold .
all these books in the two magazines ?
yes i did . i have a very pleasant time .
i ca n't accept your excuse . it 's five o 'clock .
she 's at the supermarket downstairs . she said she would be back in about half an hour .
i see .
ms . stevens . i hope you ll visit me soon .
he 's got a promotion .
well . you should have kept in class .
no . and she is so thin .
well they re completely different .
what qualities do you think are the most suitable person for this position ?
the ones that are predipped in sweet coating !
i do n't know . they think that 's because they are really important to their children .
i guess you 're right .
i like playing cards . it s a great game for fun .
mom come on ! it 's not a skill . i 've got a fever .
i saw him the first time that he was a little weak . he was too kind of a bit spicy .
i already voted .
i like spring .
it 's just a regular exercise . if you want to do something you can just get it done .
yeah that 's a good hobby .
what do you like to do there ?
you mean you didn t have to meet me there ?
why ?
i think you should go to the movies . it 's not a good thing to see .
is n't it like you can talk to her about my girlfriend ?
i wo n't forget it .
the only thing i learned was that my husband and i got excellent records .
that s all of the great wall . you know it s a very hot country for the olympics .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
i see . thank you .
yes .
i guess you 're right . but i still have to get going . i 'm so busy !
i 'm telling you the truth .
that 's fine .
i will .
i 'm afraid all the buses are taken .
oh we both felt ok .
he actually is the company <unk> company for the company . they are much better than the team .
hey look just one more thing . he is n't going to get the desk by the window .
that sounds like the compliment .
oh i feel miserable . i 've always been with a family for two years .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
not really . you should try to keep it to yourself .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
it 's not only that much . you should also learn something from now on .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i have to be a meeting tomorrow and i am diligent and i am diligent .
i know it 's a sweet show but i never did it . it 's not as bad as it was to be a guest .
may i see your ticket ?
what a pity !
i see . it was a great extreme sports for three years . it was also a proud of the world .
i 'm not sure if i can get it done right now .
how much does the cost ?
i 'm very glad to hear that . first of all i need to read up about a free letter of credit .
she 's a lot better than me . she 's a gay dog .
what about he ?
that 's good . he can spend more time in the country .
really ? how did he react ?
i guess you 're right . i 'll work hard on it .
merry christmas to you !
the same to you !
i want to have a new style of christmas .
i 'd love to . what do you think ?
i 'd love to . but i 'm not myself today .
i 'd be glad to .
she is absolutely wonderful .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
i think you 'd better ask her .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
yeah i think she 's going to like the acting in magazines .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
i 'm giving you a ticket for this .
i do n't know . my favorite movie is this time . i 'd like to see it .
yes i have . that s why she did .
the same to you !
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child i was a child i imagined and now i like reading romance stories .
there 's a real mix of stories in the book . i haven t finished all of them yet though . many of them are short detective stories but there are also horror stories and scifi ones . if you give me your business card i ll make sure you get an advance copy to review .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
the best . it 's very romantic i 've been dreaming of since i was a little boy . i guess the games will be a little warmer .
what kinds of books do you like to read ?
the lady at the desk and asked them to put their hands on to the next step .
i know it 's easier to say something about that .
it s the charge .
what about the insurance and housing policies ?
the gas and the battery both have to stay working . we could not use it .
he s a liar .
really ? i want to go too .
i like its color and the style is soft .
it s a total of the game for the first round of the world .
no no all the news about it .
and the <unk> is wonderful !
who is it ?
yes . we do n't need to .
i could n't agree with you more .
i think so . it s probably a big problem for the environment .
no but i think he 's still a brother .
ok thank you .
i am not convinced by your explanation .
he is a hard worker . he is always banging the drum for better schools .
that s fantastic . i m getting excited and i m going to go .
yeah but it is hard to find a way to understand my behavior .
yes it is . some people do n't like to listen to them .
is there anything i can do for you ?
i mean the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early .
are you a visitor or a resident ?
she 's so pretty .
oh that 's george . he looks very drunk .
the lakers . jordan is the only good player washington has .
the notice is that he could have the ball to tie it in the tie .
you made a good choice jack . the company did n't expect to play that well .
that 's right .
hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?
hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?
my name is james .
would you kindly spell it for me ?
ping . ping .
would you like to have my name ?
i 'm from new orleans . what about you ?
it was three all .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i thought it was better than the othersi really liked it . what did you think of it ?
a little cigarettes a day .
yes it was the most positive attitude of the time .
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
and i think i 'll look for an appetizer before i get back to you .
nothing . i 'm just watching tv .
i 'm not sure i guess . i 'm just too busy .
i do n't know what he like .
oh that 's too bad .
yes . he 's got the sack .
i see . i 'll try him again .
alright . that 's a good idea . and i think we can find something new there .
it 's a good thing i 've got to do . i 'll try it .
thank you for waiting .
neither . the game ended in two all .
thank you . this will be your safe .
the score was 10198 .
there is no doubt that there is a big fight with the casting of the movie .
what 's the author 's name ?
you 're right . i do n't have to worry about it .
exactly . you 're right . each of the big guy is standing on the right side .
yeah . but bob 's talent ca n't to be named on the same day with carl 's .
he is not young as he looks . i think he 's almost sixty .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
i believe they are a child .
i am so happy for them .
are you crying ?
yes i always cry at <unk> .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
yes they are .

he came in alone .
he 's got a promotion .
really ? what happened ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
did n't you ever see his car ?
well this is just between ourselves of course but he was her lover and he wanted to leave her so she got revenge . i heard him say she was a dangerous woman .
really ! you live in taiwan !
yes it is . but we charge for the inconvenience .
oh my god . please tell me how it happened .
i was denied a visa ?
when did you leave ?
i 'm sorry but face the music .
it 's not only about it .
i was denied a visa ?
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation . as you can imagine the second call .
yes he did .
yes . i think we can help .
well i love hip hop dancing so i should probably dance .
i 'll try .
he sure can . just choose a good taste .
i agree . and it 's very convenient .
i 'm not really sure about that .
right . you 'll be hearing from that song too .
i met him through a computer bulletin board .
i could go to the movies on friday night instead . can we make a list ?
no but i did find out about it . he was very nice and very good at the moment .
i had the first thing to do .
have you fallen in love ?
yes i have a little girl .
i had a few coffees while i was waiting .
i think that we should have a house in the kitchen .
he asked me to pick him out of a lineup .
it is really a pleasure to have you here . i hope you will have a nice trip home .
you 're welcome .
you really have to .
i hope so .
that 's very good . we will do it well in the interview .
i really do n't know how to thank you .
yes . but let me see if you 're positive it 's a long time to go .
ok . see you then !
see you !
is there probation ?
oh that 's interesting . do you think they must be the most suitable person for her ?
and it 's so convenient for people to wear young people .
and it 's amazing ! i 'll buy some to the new year 's eve .
i do n't think so . i 'll just have to save some money and it is not enough to use .
it 's great ! i 'm really tired ! how is it going ?
well how about like this ?
that 's a good idea .
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
that 's great ! i ca n't wait to see it .
oh it 's the best seller everyone 's been talking about for the last two years .
yes . take myself for example . i seldom go to cinemas but it does n't mean i no longer see films instead i see films at a time .
it 's just around the corner .
what was the matter ?
it starts at 8 o 'clock .
that 's fine . we can chat about the time . it 's an important thing to see . we have n't had time for a long time .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i have to go to the gym .
can you drop me off on the airport ?
oh my god . i think we 're ready to get to the gas station .
what 's the advantage about the price ?
what 's your favorite color ?
oh yes . she 's right . here is a present for you .
i can have a try . maybe you 'd like a drink .
i am really sorry . i did n't know you were a little worried about this .
sounds like a steal .
well . i think the chinese firework is beautiful is beautiful is the most common season in canada . it 's a common city in canada is north of the world .
what 's the big day after the holiday ?
i know you are right . it 's so different that it is a product different from our old year .
yeah . i know that . do you have any other suggestions ?
that s the one .
oh no . those are rich and cath and just got them yesterday .
really ?
it 's a hard question . it 's about time and it seems we have no idea how many people are .
i guess so .
what a pity !
i 'm happy to hear that .
what about we get ?
but i still do n't see them .
it 's a program about a football match .
i wonder if it could have been a use it for a long time .
yes good morning pls .
cool ! what else do you use to use ?
yes . with the 600 second digital memory l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
and anything else ?
you should use the computer .
it will be released next month .
your office is on the fourth floor .
how about rose ? it 's the most suitable one for lovers .
i 'm very glad that you find our wedding anniversary is so important to you .
do n't be so sure .
oh thank you !
well the state will benefit a lot from the competition .
150 a month .
is there a bathroom ?
oh you want to go for the taiwanese guests ?
if you go to the bank 's account it 's possible to buy some money .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
oh it 's a nice day .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
so do i . so this is delicious . well where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
well i 've heard a nine girl in the city . i 'd be knocked out on the spot .
i love you too .
i was happy to get promoted .
that 's the reason i 'm so excited .
that 's not a bad idea . what do you think ?
i 'm going to need your deposit back .
i have to see my daughter .
i believe i m actually very happy with them . i think that s why i m taking a trip .
of course i have . you re welcome .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
i 'm glad you like it .
sure i think that is a good idea .
ok . i 'll wait .
actually you have n't have much .
just black coffee .
oh that 's too bad . what time does the flight get to rome ?
i 'm sorry .
i think that 's because i was thinking of them .
yes . i have a talk to the secretary about that .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
is it a nice ride ?
i tried to go to the store but i could n't find anything to eat .
that 's great ! you should be happy about it .
i 'm still going to find a job .
is there any special project you would like to work on ?
yeah i guess i 'm glad we 've straightened everything out .
nice to see you too .
okay . how many people are you together ?
i think you are a quick learner .
no please feel free .
well . . . i was wondering what the salaries are like ?
i 'm not sure if we 've got one in the suburbs .
i 'm tom . i 'm the manager of the the the the sales department .
i love dance the fast music .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i 'd like to try some special purposes .
no . you can never tell whether you like it .
yes let 's see . oh come on the dance of the waltz .
i see . can you tell me how to put on a cup of coffee ?
are you more interested in doing those jobs ?
yes . in fact the chinese emperors used to think of their good english . they can also learn to the butterfly fund which is largely desert .
is that the products ?
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west the purpose is generally quite <unk> savor the wine .
that 's great !
the people who did it .
this is n't the only thing i 've heard .
it 's very cold . it 's always good exercise .
yes it 's very interesting and very fond of the detective stories .
well how about like this ?
ok . i 'll take a taxi .
ok . i 'll meet you in front of the dance .
i 'm a real fan of playing basketball .
thank you for your compliment .
yes i do .
yeah a good idea . you can dance music .
to tell you the truth i do n't like it .
ok let 's go .
it 's very nice . i like it very much .
what 's your favorite dance ?
i 'm afraid i 'm not .
i really wanted to watch the star wars on the opening day but the presale tickets were sold out . how did you get hold of them ?
of course . it 's a hobby .
you can have a free facial and then make up free for you . do you want to have it now ?
i see .
it 's a kind of rice ball that is made in malaysia . what about you ? it 's a special location for the job .
but i like the way that 's how it goes .
yes she is really great .
that is a good idea .
you do n't go to english class .
sounds good !
oh yes . i heard the song has been there since then .
it 's very nice i like it very much .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
thanks . i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just that you are a good leader . do you like the samba and waltz ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
i love rumba and waltz .
oh the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure .
fine .
swimming . what about you ?
tell me about it .
no there is n't .
i see . since i do n't have a coffee i can tell you why .
of course not !
what are you talking about ? the match is true and the view from the hill is always a bit ridiculous . . .
it 's already december you know .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
that s a good idea . thanks .
i want to know what kind of pie i like .
it 's very pleasant .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring .
i like it here so far .
it s the best season to take a tour in the afternoon . we can see what the sun looks like .
it 's certainly a big improvement over the grass .
yes it is . but i love it . are you going to the summer ?
i like spring too . it 's very cold and the weather is so warm .
i know . i 'm going to the winter .
it 's about 5 degrees centigrade . when it gets hot there is a big problem .
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
good idea ! we have a good rest . we can go to the park in the morning and enjoy the fresh air .
really ? i like autumn too .
it all sounds very good . i 'll take it .
yes . and i like the weather here so it 's huge .
yes i am .
why are you king in beijing ?
i 'm sorry . i 'll bring it back to you tomorrow .
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
no problem .
thank you very much .
it 's a pleasure . i hope you can find it .
how much do you charge for it ?
sure . what is it ?
i 'm afraid there 's been a mistake .
i can come in this afternoon .
let 's meet at the movie theater entrance tonight .
that 's fine . i will see you then .
yes . why ?
i 'm glad you came .
i 'd love to .
i have n't seen you so far .
do you have enough money ?
this morning .
yes . that s fine . we can book you a private room for up to ten people at that time . could you give me your name please ?
thank you for all your patience .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! darling you re kind .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
it 's not the right material . or the right color . i ca n't possibly accept it .
you know . you can get it fixed soon .
it 's usually very reliable . it 's a skill in my first year .
what do you think of the leading actors ?
most of the time it was better to drive fast .
what else is wrong with it ?
it 's not the right material . or the right color . i ca n't possibly accept it .
anything else ?
no thank you .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
what are you talking about ? we will write it down right now .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold and really got rid of him .
i see .
i think so . thank you .
you are welcome .
you 're welcome .
what time is it going to be there ?
i 've just parted with my boyfriend .
does mary know that ?
yes he is .
why do you think so ?
because i love the snow .
how come ?
ok .
i 'd love to . what time ?
why ? do you think i can take a message for you ?
this friday evening ?
what 's your name ?
i am really sorry . i did n't realize it .
oh they are . i m not an expert but that s it .
how old is your sister ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister .
i 'm leaving here tomorrow .
it 's my pleasure . what can i do for you today ?
i really appreciate you taking the beach with me .
i m sure you will . goodbye .
i 'll give you a call .
you 're welcome .
she has to say about that before .
i know . but i am just worried about her .
i do .
perhaps you can ask her out .
i could look at your shop at the airport and see if it 's fine . you can pick up the rest of the things that you find in a little far away from the airport and i can go .
i 'd love to . i 'd like to go to the britain to visit the great wall .
what 's the problem ?
you 're right . i think i 'll be able to give you a lift .
well that s not good . it s important to make a quick breakfast . it s actually a good thing to do with your boss .
try to be natural alert and interested .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . you must be tough .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and i also want to know more about this posttrip .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i do n't believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem .
yes . it s a very good job . it s very interesting to be able to see all the places of world and world cup of world .
you should have kept an eye on it .
yes . it s a most popular place to live .
of course .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
and look not feel .
yes i do .
i am going to refer you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma .
very interesting . very interesting . . .
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
what size are you ?
this is a perfect opportunity for you .
but i am not sure about it . if you 're going to take this up with me i 'll be happy to go with you .
i 'm glad you came . but here is my card . you need to take a rest .
what should i do with the proposed ?
i know . that 's a good idea . how can we do this today ?
just a minute please . i ll take this one .
yes you are right .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your size .
i do n't want to see it .
stop beating around the bush . will you quit or not ?
yes . it 's a sharp pain in my car .
not really . i thought the ancient olympics was very interesting . but just funny .
i have read about the name of her .
i ca n't believe it . who were those kids ?
that 's the beauty of the service they did .
oh gosh ! i ca n't bear it ! i have to tell you how to surf the net .
i do n't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed that was very interesting .
yes that s right . and i ll be there right on time .
i know that it is the same as the new one .
sure . i 've already been waiting for you .
oh you re not going to be difficult with me . i m afraid you re not supposed to be able to do that .
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .
wow ! i m so lucky !
i think it 's time to go and get that .
she 'll be so happy .
well could you pick me up at the airport ?
ok . i 'll be there .
she is in the united states .
oh it 's really far from home . are you going to visit us ?
about half a year .
i see . it 's a lovely neighborhood .
she has been in the hospital for about three years .
not bad . but i feel terrible .
did you just come ?
yes we have a beautiful french fries and a medium coke .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
i think about twentyfive .

that s right .
this is her second day .
it 's available now .
you mean you like to study english ? why ?
she is still in the hospital .
it tastes very good .
i 'm giving you a ticket for this .
it s really very good .
why ?
thanks a lot .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he is a very nice guy and very considerate .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .
how old is he now ?
he 's over sixty .
why do you say that ?
what 's he doing ?
he 's checking bags .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
he 's very nice actually but rather eccentric .
i 'm sorry but you know i really ca n't .
what about the one after that ?
may i have a look at it ?
i 'd love to but i 'm not sure myself .
i 'll bet you were all right .
i hope so .
yeah . you should do it too .
well there s nothing i can do about it .
yeah . but bob 's talent ca n't to be named on the same day with carl 's .
sure i will .
yes he lives in washington d . c . c .
did you get caught in a traffic jam ?
i 'm afraid not .
i think he 's being a little crazy .
i 'm sorry sir . i will give you a call and call you back in two days .
that s great . i appreciate your help .
i am just wondering if you like to go to the us .
why did you leave so early ?
i can understand that .
he does n't need any help . he is a good accountant and he 'd better work with the company .
yes . he 's really lucky .
yes i did .
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
what do you want to do ?
i 'm sorry . it 's completely out of my life .
i know . she s a nice girl but she always harps on me .
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
i think i can study english quite well if i do n't know why .
really ? what 's it about ?
well standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . express is the fastest but it also takes three days and you can track your package online . it 's also the most expensive .
do you like playing table tennis ?
what 's he like ?
he 's very good indeed .
but he s not the right person .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall . shall we go there ?
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
really ? what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
what about your mother ?
i 'll work hard . that 's my only time to think about it .
i feel better i really stupid .
i do n't know . i did n't realize it .
em it 's delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
i 'm going to the movies with a friend .
i m just looking at this map of the world . i m preparing for a geography class .
that 's a good idea !
i know a place that should be perfect . it 's called the china friendship hotel and it 's pretty much like an american mall except with a chicken !
i 'd love to .
when does the next plane leave ?
i 'll pick you up at your hotel at eight o 'clock and we 'll bring you one in the morning .
i 'd love to but i have to tell you the truth it 's the secret to buy in the new bar .
i know but you decided to leave it and call the client to let me know .
no . i was just thinking about getting a bite to eat .
i was thinking of seeing you me and dupree . it 's a typical hollywood blockbuster .
i will try my best to help you prepare for your birthday .
yes it is . come on in and see the fitting room is right over there .
i 'm not sure i have the time .
it 's not that bad . it 's a real thing to do .
i hope that everyone can help to find food .
yes . i 'm just waiting for someone .
this is a small town and we like to be neighborly . we know everyone who lives around here .
i 'm fine . how about you ? how are you ?
i 'd love to but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
yeah that sounds like fun .
yes i think so . the security door is very fresh .
sure . i live on this street just west .
yes that would be great . i 'll be there on time .
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
no thank you . no .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
i see . do you live in the middle of the summer ?
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
i have to see my daughter .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
how many children do they have ?
hi paul . i am glad to help you .
yes it is . come on and visit me again !
i have lived here for twenty years .
may i know your occupation ?
may i take your order ?
how many pieces do they have ?
i love you too !
all right . anything else ?
i 've been away on vacation .
yes it has been a long time since the last time we met .
since last weekend i met him before the boss met on the internet and now i 'm not sure but i do n't know what i should do .
what do you think of it ?
i just worked in a small department of a trade company .
what is your major going to be ?
i 'm majoring in english .
but sir many employees use instant messaging to communicate with their clients .
i will think about it .
hi george . i hope you 've been good .
oh i am sorry . i didn t know you were going to marry me . i ve never been to the hospital before .
i want to give you a ride .
yes . i graduated this past june .
i 'm in hui . do sit down wo n't you ?
just fine and you ?
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yes 'm . and there are too many things to sell .
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
how long do you want to take it ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when it 's nicer .
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
this spot has really become a <unk> for those in this shade .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
let 's just hope it does n't get cold again .
we have a lot of nerve telling our ads sucked .
i m sure you do miss that . but i know little about him .
whatever . have a drink .
she s sitting under the tree .
do n't you think she will be back by the end of this month ?
tom that lucky guy .
oh he s fine . kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays .
how terrible !
terrible .
she s been a bit nervous i guess .
nothing .
sounds like you 're right .
it sounds like you might be a good fit for the job .
you can say that again . he will be there as soon as he is he can .
yeah . and i often forget him 's report .
are you aware that you ran through that stop sign ?
i think if you like it then we should play together some time .
that 's good . she is also very pretty .
yeah . she married him at her mother 's bidding .
i do n't think she 's that strongminded .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
so are you going to go ?
i want to try something exciting .
well it 's really far away from here .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i think you 're right . i 'll change it . i really feel terrible .
i do n't know . i just feel a little sad .
not at all .
it s all right . you need to get in .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yes . and suddenly i heard someone call my name . i turned around and there was this man looking at me . i thought i was coming one of the girl who dressed up . what did you think about the food ?
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
you mean the red one ?
i 've got a fever and a very sore throat .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
i 'll try my best . but he 's really <unk> .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said it 's a lovely day . why do n't we go for a walk ?
i think he s going to be able to make another appointment .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
he is a worker .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but it 's getting late .
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he saw my jobseeking information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
and he also wants to stay in the kitchen . . . do you think he could do a good job in the kitchen ?
i think he 's very good at ability to cure the contest .
how can you be so sure ?
he knows a lot about law and he s eloquent too .
never believe his words .
i do n't know .
i think so . i do n't want to put a big problem with them so it was a good thing that i can get him something done . i do n't want to be a big mistake or my old .
i like the way that the blue one sounds nice .
you 're right . he sure is .
really ? who was that ?
you mean you 're a <unk> man ?
thank you .
well i know a little of the characters . but i am not sure whether i have a large customer i will try . it 's a secret of cooperation .
are you sure ?
yes . please fill in this form and show me your passport .
she 's not going to be my parents are a bit .
don t worry about that . it s probably of the stress you ve been under . just take some aspirin . combined with the stronger cough medicine it will make you feel very tired . you shouldn t work or use any equipment which requires concentration . if i were you i d just sleep read a book or watch tv . here is your prescription . here is your prescription .
here is the room . do you need anything else ?
i 'm on a diet . and i do more exercise regularly .
i 'm sorry that 's not a girl . i 'm sure she 'll be happy .
i think it s because of the bad weather .
maybe you are right . but i just heard the chinese firework is very beautiful . it 's more exciting to me .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
she 's going to be there right now . she 's going to have an meeting with the boss .
it seems that they really enjoy their retirement .
it 's true . the board man last thirdly and they choice paul .
we have to get along with each other and fight a lot .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell her off .
so you 're going to have to clean it up before you do it .
he is a real <unk> . i have n't seen you for a long time .
i know sir . i did n't think you 'd be interested in it .
it must be kate .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
he does n't ! it 's the teacher 's sister who could sell it .
no i don t think so .
really ?
yes . i think that is a good girl .
well you can help with the family you should make some decision about what you want .
i am happy . it 's not my fault .
i see . i 'm sure you will disagree . something else do n't you think ?
i think so . it 's just a friendly place to be true .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
you ought to complain . these machine are always out of order .
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
not too bad . but busy every night .

how ay ! your father is in the family .
do you mean that you re a <unk> ?
i had an idea . i was so sorry to tell you that i was n't feeling well .
i see . it s easy to get a coffee .
it 's hard to say . but my father is a bit laid back .
what s your brother like ?
yes we do . i get a lot of them .

ok i 'll be waiting .
i 'm sorry to hear that .

yeah . how long has she been on the bus ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
oh no the car will be ready soon .
now i think you 're done .
i think that s the most important thing to me . i don t think that any sense of a good idea .
i know . i think the kitchen is open .
my husband is an american . he criticizes me when i do that . he says he is a lot of good . he is learning what i am doing now .
you mean a guy using jeans ?
yes he is . he s so hardworking when he comes to the doctor s home .
well done !
well . you re okay . i guess i ll have to wait for the next bus .
i can t believe it . we can t stay in the car and walk back to the garage and have a look .
she 's so good to hear .
well trains are frequent and come on time .
well . we should be in touch with the news .

how about summer ?
well . . . we re going to england by this tuesday .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
i 'm sure she 's right .
i 'm afraid we ca n't come back for another merry christmas .
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes but i 'm not sure if it 's going to be .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
he 's very nice .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i did .
you speak good english though .
yes it is the best one i have ever seen .
what 's the matter ?
not too bad . i just got back from hawaii .
i 'm fine too thank you .
where are you from sam ?
with the greatest pleasure ! where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . it 's a piano <unk> .
yes i did .
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
yes may i help you ?
yes i 'm looking for a house .
yes please .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
nice to meet you john .
nice to meet you too .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
are you serious ?
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages .
what would you suggest to see ?
i 'm not sure . i do n't know .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
here is your boarding pass .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
i 've got a fever and a very sore throat .
i 've been working too hard .
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
you know i 'm not the only one who has done this .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
all right .
i 'd better not .
that 's a good idea . what s on ?
it was about a married couple .
you bet ! i had a good time . you know it was a good car .
yes may i ask who 's calling ?
i am glad to tell you that you are supposed to come for an interview tomorrow . are you free tomorrow ?
wow ! what a surprise !
hi tom . things are just fine today .
oh that would be great . actually we could go together sometime . i d really appreciate you taking the rest of the world .
how about at 330 ?
good evening mary .
good evening mary .
i have n't seen you for a long time .
i m sorry to hear that .
what 's your name please ?
oh thank you .
how do you do ? nice to meet you ms . smith . i m jack stevens from the marketing department . here is my card .
hi steven this is jill . i wanna see you for yourself . how are you ?
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well too is there anything i can do for you ?
oh that s a pity . i ll come .
thank you very much .
thank you .
ok . i will do it for you .
i have a really bad headache .
oh thanks . i appreciate that .
yes i am . i just bought a new job in advertising company .
i suggest you get a few tins of each order .
i think you 'd better take an additional course in some foreign companies .
i will be voting .
yes you do .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
no problem . we 've already done it for the next few days . but we should wait for the next bus .
i understand . it is the time to pay the rent .
i 'm afraid it 's our only 5 yuan .
i also think it 's much better to tell the truth .
no no not at all .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool .
my house is in the ads . i think i 'll go to the local community and have to find a place to stay in the house .
i have a threeyearold son .
i learned about that from the public school . in fact i was a little bit nervous . so i changed my mind myself .
not really they just share the same thing with me .
it sounds like you 've found your soul mate .
i know i know . but it seems that i 'm not a very good student . i have to work so hard . i want to work in a company so i want to take it i 've been studying . i have to work and study it 's a good thing . i want to work to work my parents to work to work my parents to work my parents to work to work my parents to say that out .
i know i need to learn that myself but i just do n't have the money for it . living at home allows me to save up some money before i started finding a place .
i 'm from texas . i was in china once but it was a long time ago .
good ! i have to get a little early .
i did n't know . i guess i have a choice of mine .
it is good to hear that .
it 's our one of our lives . it 's known as we 've been in this area for a long time .
sounds interesting .
i have n't heard anything about it .
i know that . i think i should wear more casual clothes that day . some of your new year will take a long time .
i guess you 're right . and i also like to have my own family to get to know on a business trip .
how often do you get to meet them ?
i know that . i have been doing the same thing in america for nearly two years . i have n't taken any job in the u . s . now and i 've got a job .
what happened ? are you serious ?
he is but he soon feel regretted for it .
i hope it s not a big wedding .
you are kidding . what happened ?
my parents have just been helping him . my brother and i don t know why to go to the beach anytime . it s just a common practice .
no it s just that i m a little nervous . i mean it s a special place to give our children a little money .
it s quite reasonable .
i used to be a teacher that runs on a business trip for high school .
so you 're from taiwan ?
sounds like a good idea !
well that s true . if you want to keep it for a couple of days you ll have to work overtime .
she asked me to pick up my work and have a dinner date tonight .
i see . i think maybe i can help you with that .
why ? what about your salary ?
do they have to work overtime ?
i guess you are right .
i ve been out of town . i just got back .
that s a good idea . you can get a fine job at least .
i ve been in china several years . i was hoping to get a place to live . what about you ?
when do you get to leave ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
of course . if you ca n't drive it by car then we will have to go .
oh your parents took a holiday too .
very well . i m just fine and i like all the sports highlight those other things . i m so good at tennis and i m so closed to watching .
i don t know . i don t like big enough . and i m too tired to watch my english together .
and she 's good at sports too . she knows how to play tennis and basketball .
i like to read a history of ancient novel .
in that case i would recommend you at least glance through these brochures just to make sure that you have selected the right policy for you .
well i have to drive to work for a long time . i 've got to go .
you play badminton ? that 's unbelievable ! you are shorter than a racket .
i know he s going to be the next president .
but i get a graduate from now on a business trip to south america . it s a good exercise to keep fit .
did you have to take any drug or less ?
i will call you when a computer is free .
the sunshine state certainly is beautiful too .
i 'll pick you up at about 600 .
well i think you should have more . if you have more chance to eat the most .
how did you like it ?
yeah i went .
there 's a program on right now .
right .
what do you mean ?
football ? it s a very exciting game because it keeps you alert and i also enjoy watching football .
i think most people treat the night life of the games .
i want to play soccer team .
well . you really should go and play ball yourself rather than watching games .
most people like football . it s more fun than a game .
well i do n't know . but i 'm not a big fan of tv .
yes she does . do you think a regular life is suitable for you ?
i do n't know . i never thought of that . i thought i would be a singer . i thought i were in high school .
i know that he had a friend and i could not have made it any sense of humor . my lease is much better than i expected . but now i m glad we can t find a way .
yes i 'm sure you have a good time .
that 's right ! i do n't know the teachers .
you re only going to get a few things !
yeah i 've been here for two years .
it s a great job to work overtime . it s for that .
that s a lot of work .
one of the best things is that you need to keep yourself in mind that you use a computer and the sugar is no problem for me . if you drink a cup of coffee you can also get it .
it 's not you can just watch . it s just that you should also be an active <unk> and active <unk> . people should learn more from high groups .
that 's true . i can use the gym for fun .
you 're so lucky .
yes . it seems to be the right amount for the inconvenience .
that 's true .
i think he 's got the wrong person .
i do n't know . to tell you the truth i 'm a little worried about my boss .
i do n't know . i always think that there 's too much competition .
i 'm not sure if it 's your fault .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
thanks for the warning .
i 'm afraid i have n't .
i think you 'd better cooperate with elvin .
but where 's the fun in that shop ?
give me a break . i know your quarrel with you .
not bad . how about you ?
hey ! they 're just waiting for their call .
if you got your bottom line all the way down to pay a phone bill and maybe it 's broken .
and not expensive either .
i don t know .
i feel terrible i really didn t mean to knock you over .
oh i see .
i want to mail this letter .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s an anniversary of our weeding .
he said he would be doing that again .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
i am afraid that i did n't mean to pay you for it .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he had better make a change .
have you taken his temperature ?
but he should pay everything .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . it was a heavy raining afternoon .
how do you know that ?
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
do n't be so sure about it . i 'm sure they do n't like it .
i see .
sure . i 'll give you a ring next week .
do you want me to give you a ride ?
peter . you 're so cute .
what a pity !
i 'm just friends .
i do n't know . i never thought that a girl like that before . it happens that i do n't have any children that have a lot of <unk> in mind .
she s a very good man to know .
i don t know .
you know maybe we could get her some concert tickets . who would know her favorite groups ?
no that 's not true . all the people and the others are from teachers .
you are right .
i 'm an english teacher .
what s the dog like ?
i 'm in a good mood today actually . how about you ?
maybe later . . . but it 's getting dark .
i 've got all the cords plugged in but it appears that i 'm offline .
but he really makes things so embarrassed .
no he did n't . his wife died and left him loads of money .
and three pieces of cake !
i 'm not sure he did .
oh it 's a chinese song .
you could say that !
do n't be silly .
i know it takes some time to learn .
ok . take care .
we can also find a shelter from the factory .
yes it is . and it is the best coffee shop in the kitchen .
it 's 530 by my watch .
yes it is .
do you do the same exercises every day ?
yes i really want to hear about it .
yes i do .
that 's great . i 'll follow your advice .
oh no !
let me see . if i 've got a few minutes to go .
good idea . i want some too .
yes . if you want to go outside you can get to the station . that will be moving soon .
me too . what s your family like ?
i think you deserve it . you know it 's a great opportunity to get into the foreign trade business .
yes i will .
oh that 's easy . i know i 'll have to work on it .
how about your mother ?
what time does it start ?
well i hate to tell you that but i think it 's just a excuse .
of course he 's a sly dog . he 's a young man . he 'll be my best man .
yes .
it 's true . the game is really funny . i think he can make it .
yeah . but he is lucky to be his wife .
that 's true . dad is a good idea . i can also go to the gym like this . so i can get myself in .
no it 's just around the corner .
i like the play . can i have a try ?
you are welcome .
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
nice to meet you too . miss li . please have a seat . i know you are very chinese .
nice to meet you too .
good morning mrs smith .
of course i will . let 's go .
you are welcome .
i 'm sorry . i know it 's a big problem . but i ca n't find it .
i know you ca n't be serious . you ca n't expect a lot to change . but you 'd be working too hard . do n't you know the problem ?
yes i know . it 's the most important thing to protect the world from china . the clothes are from central america .
yes there are many famous corporations .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
but there 's no doubt that everything will be paid .
i 'm sure i 'll be there .
well good luck with your eyes !
it seems that a lot of work . i 'll try my best to get the job done by myself .
very well . how much do you drink ?
i see . i 'd like to choose one .
i 'd swear that i ca n't !
ok . what about tea ? can you tell me about it ?
you can say that .
thank you ! i 'll be there !
there 's no need to be so frustrated .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . i 'm very glad to meet you too .
thank you .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
sometimes . but chinese tea is not very good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
it 's a butterfly stroke . my family is working for me .
is there anything interesting ?
not really . just watching the sports highlight on espn .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
and the dog s bread is that he had a tree over there with some friends .
but he 's so shy .
because i feel tired all the time even when i wake up in the morning . i find it very difficult to do any work .
how about the cost of gasoline these days ?
you are right . but i think we should find one for each other . it 's a pity really because it 's not very common in our country .
ok . . . the first thing i need is the first .
yes it 's very nice of you to say so .
i 'd like to have a try .
there s no hot water in the country .
there s about time to see the match . it s almost the size of the world and looks so cool . it s just the same size of the world .
that s right .
it s all religion . take the theory of the big bang . how do you make it possible to play the game ?
there are a lot of rugby fans in my country too .
that 's not the only thing . if you pay for them you might not <unk> the bill .
no there are not enough educational .
he was a cute tie .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
what else do you play ?
yeah i know what you mean . i should make enough to buy without a drink .
that s too bad . i m sorry to hear that . is there anything else i can do for you ?
do you have a fever ?
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
yeah . i got it .
i guess you ve got to put a few things on the list .
oh i see . i am really sorry . i will have to call you back as soon as i can .
well ok . i ll start next week . you ve got to see me next week !
no but i ve got a prescription .
i will remember that .
yes i had a few glasses of glasses while i was waiting . but now i did n't know them .
it 's simply a lot of pressure from driving .
well i think the route is really charming . how long is the museum of beijing ?
i agree . buses are more cramps and there are too .
i agree . but i would find it difficult to stop using my car .
just give me two more one for the blue one and a white one .
i agree . that s why we only do the same thing . most people in the movies buy frozen pizza we bought from the government .
i guess you re right . maybe they ll do the same for your job .
right . the air in this city is also a very big problem . it s a very quiet city and peaceful .
that s right . i think it s a good idea to find a greener city to live in . living in a polluted city like this just is <unk> kitchen .
i did n't notice it .
really ? but i think they 're going to be more expensive .
no problem ! i ll stop by your home and get back to you when the police arrive .
he must be proud of you .
i wonder if he did n't have been sick .
what do you think is that ?
no it 's the wrong way . the king is only one who has the most practical sense .
he ll be fine . i think .
oh yes . it 's a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
is it very quiet in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
it s a very good game .
do you play bridge ?
it s hard to say . but i like the game so i don t really care about it .
it s a difficult job to get around .
they re hard to say . i don t think so .
that sounds like fun ! what should i do if you think of the country it ?
look at the girls in the street . they don t have one type of books .
i think playing is the best player on the field .
do you like playing table tennis ?
what ? you re such a wimp ! you remember ?
that 's the last game .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
have you had any type of cold lately ?
i ve been having a low fever . i just feel terrible .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure you ll enjoy the dinner .
yes he s quite an isn t he ?
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
they are different . there are too many fashion victims out there and you 'll never wear them .
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what s you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it 's nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
he s a professional and very good player .
i see . you have to find he s s s good at first .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
yes i was . i like to know about the play pingpong .
what s the most important thing to check that you have passed every test of the information ?
yes i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more .
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i know what you mean . i think the idea of other people don t buy anything . they want people to buy old clothes !
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you 're welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about seven .
ok . i 'll come .
yes but i prefer red wine with meat .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes . it could be very crowded in the country . then it is very romantic to watch it .
i 'm not surprised . she 's a plain jane .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
you should watch the news more often .
thanks a lot .
well i 'm afraid we have to start for the best .
well wonder who can have been having such an easy time together ?
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
yes we are match made in heaven .
i mean you could n't give it up !
yes . i remember .
we wanted to go to the stadium . we could have a small celebration of the local community to go .
what a pity !
oh french dressing .
do you think that maybe you should get yourself some rest .
he said he saw my jobseeking information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me that he has passed out of class .
why ? it 's been good for him to get up early .
yes ten days .
yes it is .
i am really sorry for that .
yes please .
here is the menu .
very well . let 's see according to his vaccination record ricky has received his <unk> tetanus and hepatitis b shots . he 's 14 months old so he 's got the first six .
hi clyde . this is linda . i 'm glad to meet you .
i am a freelance english teacher . how about you ?
tell me what you want to know .
i am studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .
yes . i 'll be back in a minute .
yes .
yes . i 'll come in tomorrow .
oh you do n't have to thank me for being a very understanding of me . i do n't want to have any time for me .
pardon ?
what university would you enter ?
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
no thank you .
how about this one ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
sure . we have to think it would be a good thing to get together .
you 're absolutely right . i think it 's worthwhile .
yes it 's so popular that it 's sold out . do you want to go with me ?
i 'm so sorry for that .
i have to see my daughter .
is that right ?
ok .
it wo n't be long . no more than ten minutes . why do n't you go to the office and have breakfast now ?
oh it 's my fault . thank you .
i took a break . . . i made it myself .
ok . what is the essence of these floor on the table ?
yes it 's great but i 'm still waiting for my invitation .
what 's that ?
i have to work on it .
i 'll say the rest of the day .
we have to find a shelter . i 'll be there tomorrow .
well you could try . it 's easy . if you have a job and you could take it sometime .
okay . i 'll be waiting for you .
you 're welcome .
that 's fine with me . how about a sichuan food ?
oh it 's delicious !
do n't mention it .
it is strange that you have to leave them with a reason to move your hands .
wow that 's really good .
what was that ?
what 's the matter ?
oh god ! it 's all about them .
how much is the total charge ?
first of all you should get yourself dressed . it 's a chance to get yourself something really special .
well thanks for your instruction . i think i ll tell you the real department .
that 's a good idea . why do n't we make a big decision ? it 's a waste of money .
sorry mr . smith . if you want to live here you are .
well i ve been waiting for your call but i don t know what to do !
yes i did . thanks for coming . bye .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
did they let you go to a lot of different cities ?
and she is thin and her husband is driving me up .
it should have been such a long time .
thanks . well you know i am not really interested in this !
let s go . is there a special restaurant ?
we should we get plenty of time . we should get there too .
that 's all right . i 'll take those .
no i m afraid i m going to be too early .
great ! how s that ?
have a heart honey ! you know .
so what about you ? are you doing anything this morning ?
yeah . whatever .
hey i 'm a little nervous !
well i think i can tell you now that i have a bad memory .
i 'd love to go to the movies .
it s my mother ! i have to make a speech on my reading and i m not sure i can study !
yeah it 's a lot better than i wanted to do .
well i believe you re a child .
can i see the rainbow ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes i am sure . i bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted .
yeah but it 's a lot easier to keep up the prices you have in the long way .
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
yes i 'm going to take a holiday tomorrow .
don t worry . he can do it very well .
i have to see my daughter .
i also think you are a lucky man .
it s not as complicated as it is . he just likes to listen to the police as you don t know .
i m completely . i think they re great . i agree with you about spiders and snakes . i think spiders are horrible . i think spiders are horrible . i think that s because they have so many legs .
i guess so .
it 's in the eyes . you 'd better not be late for school today .
fine . good luck !
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must first thing you must first thing you must first learn how to handle them .
thanks for your help ! i never heard of that before .
yeah the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder to make up .
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s just a few drops ! he s just a little over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . he can jump over two meters . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it s a great idea to get a lot of money from it .
do you know a lot about him ?
well . the traffic is not very heavy . it s probably as convenient as the subway . it s not much trouble at the traffic lights .
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
ok goodbye .
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
how about at 330 ?
all right .
no i do n't mind at all .
it 's all right . you really should go to the file .
no . you can go to a disco with me .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
i did n't know you liked it .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yes . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
i 'll try .
no but i 'm busy .
do you feel ok ?
snakes ?
how about this one ? it 's a kind of leather one .
it 's a camera .
that 's great ! this is going to be going to be a really good thing .
yes .
what a lovely dress ! how about this one ? it 's a lovely dress .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
yes i 've already been to here for two weeks .
i am sorry . you have to wait at least a moment .
you are welcome !
in that case you should try to find a job that is <unk> where you can find one .
that 's true . i should work on it . i hope to see you then .
oh . . . i d love to go to the movies . i love to go .
i know . so what are you talking about ? i just lost my weight !
yes i have . it s very exciting .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master . practice makes the master . practice makes the master . practice makes the
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
he sounds more like an assistant than to pay a salary .
i m not good at it either . he s a millionaire . i know you can be crazy about him and teach him how to do it .
i agree . it 's definitely a big problem .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
i hope so .
do you know anything about britain and america ?
ok please go right ahead .
you are right .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
i agree . and sometimes i still like to read romance stories .
you should always have some fun .
well it 's only about one hundred yuan .
well i like playing cards .
that 's what we like to hear a profitable business .
yes i have the chance .
i 'm going to visit my sister .
that 's a good idea . you 'll be so happy .
okay it 's good . it 's an important meeting and the theater is marvelous as well as efficient .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
i couldn t agree more . you do have to prepare food and make it .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
what 's the matter ?
thanks for inviting me . i was really sorry . i didn t know where it was .
i 'll meet you there in time .
i d love to but i m not sure i ll get to it .
oh really ?
can we talk about it now ?
well . i hope to see you next time .
what happened ? are you serious ?
he is but he soon feel regretted for it .
i hope it s not a big wedding .
you are kidding . what happened ?
my parents have just been helping him . my brother and i don t know why to go to the beach anytime . it s just a common practice .
no it s just that i m a little nervous . i mean it s a special place to give our children a little money .
it s quite reasonable .
i 'm from texas . i was in china once but it was a long time ago .
good ! i have to get a little early .
i did n't know . i guess i have a choice of mine .
it is good to hear that .
it 's our one of our lives . it 's known as we 've been in this area for a long time .
sounds interesting .
i have n't heard anything about it .
i know that . i think i should wear more casual clothes that day . some of your new year will take a long time .
i guess you 're right . and i also like to have my own family to get to know on a business trip .
do n't mention it . it s my pleasure . have you been to one of these large sitdown dinner parties since you got to new haven ?
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i did n't want to be late . but i was the first one there .
i ll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from work .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight o clock !
do n't worry . we ll be the first time .
the same to you !
i know . it 's just a policy of ours .
it s a great honor to have you here mr . brown .
yes it is . do you like it ?
you know what ?
after you take my picture here or can you cook things out for me ? i want to get some things done .
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i did n't know .
that s all right .
i guess so . so what do you do for this job ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well you certainly didn t want to be honest about our time flying . i guess you could be a good fit .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be there .
why do you say that ?
well trains are frequent and come on time .
some of the people have been drawn to me . i think it is a good idea to put their own decisions in the university .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've heard that .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town . i just got back .
that s a good idea . you can get a fine job at least .
i ve been in china several years . i was hoping to get a place to live . what about you ?
when do you get to leave ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
of course . if you ca n't drive it by car then we will have to go .
my name is jim . what s your name ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
i m from work .
yes i 'm very fond of you . i do n't think i 've been able to get this .
i love you here . you re more than welcome .
certainly . i will help you try my best .
i love you . and i love you to come here for dinner .
sorry i did n't mean to be . i 'm just sad . i do n't wanna be a naughty boy you know .
i m sorry sir . i ll bring you a receipt when i return .
no i don t . i go on a winter holiday instead . i go to see my parents every day .
i 'm so nervous . i do n't know what to say to it .
what 's your favorite dance ?
how often do you write to them ?
thanks . that s very kind of you . i need to take this box for the library .
i really like this outfit .
good news . that sounds like a plan .
i have to go to work .
i m never coming to a play anymore . i prefer something more and more exciting .
i used to be a teacher that runs on a business trip for high school .
so you 're from taiwan ?
sounds like a good idea !
well that s true . if you want to keep it for a couple of days you ll have to work overtime .
she asked me to pick up my work and have a dinner date tonight .
i see . i think maybe i can help you with that .
why ? what about your salary ?
do they have to work overtime ?
i guess you are right .
is it enough for me to buy one ?
it 's only 20 a month .
oh you 've already grown up son .
you bet . we could eat a lot more fast .
you re right . we could eat a red and then we could eat the whole day .
i do n't know . i have to face this music and make it much easier .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
you mean you want to go to the top of the eiffel tower the world ?
no problem .
not yet . i am watching ultraman instead . no no no no dad . this program is on only once a week .
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
she is a nice girl .
i 'm not her ears .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do .
that 's the whole team .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
i just thought it was easy .
i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh i did n't really like it .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the internet .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
oh yes . i love it very much .
it 's a thriller .
what 's on tomorrow ?
i have n't even heard of it .
it 's great !
why ? he s so good at the end of this month .
of course ! i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
i m sure you ll enjoy the holiday .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i went to the university of ohio in america .
oh you mean you feel better now ?
oh well . i see . do you know the subway train you can take .
i 'll get to go . what can i do for you ?
i hope so . thanks for your help .
that is a good idea . i 'm very happy to hear that . what time do you think is convenient to see ?
it 's a great idea . i do n't like it very much .
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
well there are 60 factories . the monthly rate is 1 . 000 yuan per hour .
that s great ! do you have any other suggestions ?
well they are very fashionable and very fashionable .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i do n't want to buy any cigarettes .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
how about tomorrow afternoon ?
it s hard to commute a long way .
it s a good thing to do with the work .
i 'm pretty good .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . i do n't know you are a little worried about the last time . i 'm sure you 'll be a little more than you do .
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
me too .
i 'm sorry . i 'll ask you a question .
well i know . but i do n't drink much . and i know you 're really good at c !
i 'm a nurse at a hospital .
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to tom we 'd have the wedding in the etv ? he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
do n't worry about it . just follow me .
me too .
yes . i want to play soccer and legs .
why do n't you visit us ?
i like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again . in spring the weather is very changeablesometimes cold sometimes warm . it s usually windy with some rain . autumn is usually sunny and dry but it s gradually gets very cold .
i know . i 'm going to the winter .
at nine thirty .
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well i hate to say you re a bit dehydrated . let me call you when you feel free to have a rest .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
how many ports do you want to join our boat ?
it 's still amazing .
yes . it s really cold in winter .
thank you very much .
you mean you didn t know much english ?
yes i am .
i see .
i m sorry to hear that .
i am so glad that you like them .
i love you too dad . thank you very much .
i am very impressed by your resume .
i like it here so far .
there s a subway station nearby . there s a subway station just round the corner .
this is very nice .
why not ?
i ll try to go to the airport and see you off .
how come ?
i appreciate you very much .
now let 's get started .
the same to you !
are you doing anything special ?
we 're having some friends over . what 's your favorite color ?

i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .

i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
i 'm sorry . i 'll ask him to call you when he comes .
yes . it s the most important thing to me .
you have been in peking university had n't you ?
yeah . she married him at her mother 's bidding .
you 're right . but he 's handsome and rich .
well it s true . it s a policy of the bank .
i 'd love to .
i see . do you think the rain should be seen the low branches ?
i have to see my daughter .
you have a phone on the bedside table that you can use .
you 're right . it 's not easy to be george .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
i do n't know how to use the atm .
i have to say i 'm sure if it 's not too much of a problem .
i 'm sorry . i 'm already tonight .
you are kidding .
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
do she is even a regular family ?
oh no !
no . . . . . i was just thinking of inviting her to dinner . i told her that i 'm so happy .
i 'm sure you 'll like it .
i 'm leaving on sunday afternoon .
i 'll tell you what .
why not ? it s a piece of cake ! it s a lovely day !
no he 's out of the hospital .
oh i 'm so sorry .
nothing really .
well that 's life .
i do n't know . i heard him was having a separation for 2 months and he never came to the library and never came back to the office .
i do n't know . i could n't believe it at first .
yeah . she s got her hair and s quite smart .
how come ?
i just think it 's time to say goodbye .
there was no reason to catch a wrong number .
great idea . shall we go there alone ?
thank you .
i will .
you know i 'm a bench boy .
i am sorry . she s out of town .
sorry i 'm afraid we have n't had any . our our room has been over over half a week .
we cannot reach a final decision until we get married .
i 'll be there .
she 's going to be doing great .
where did you say that ?
you mean mary ?
who is your boss ?
i hope so .
i hope so .
they 're going to throw in a new apartment in the suburbs .
yes he is running for class president .
why ?
i am new to the work . i think i ll have studied with the previous company .
well trains are frequent and come on time .
he 's a bit handsome . he was always taking a good time in the kitchen and his wife is much more relaxed than him .
yes i do .
what does he look like ? are you sure ?
i 'd love to . but i 'm not myself today .
i do n't know . i 'll call them now .
they 're glad to hear that .
i know . i could n't do that .
ok well i guess you re right . we should probably think about going somewhere that is n't too far away .
you mean he had a low heart for the right to do something like that ?
i guess that 's the only way to get a job done .
and it 's a lot more serious . you are a runner now .
thank you for your consideration .
that s right . we wish to stay in touch with each other and see what we can continue to deal with .
i appreciate you helping me with this .
i 'm sorry .
do you think that i am going to dream about the party ?
no .
good . this is your first year in college .
me too . i 'm always excited about her .
well you should n't be stuck in the traffic forever . i think you deserve to help with a friend .

thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .

yes i have . i 'm fond of george .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let me take a look . oh here s your prescription . it 's on the desk .
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . i think i need to focus on my own .
i see . how did you feel today ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
yes but i do n't think you can find it .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too .
no it 's a brother 's car ! the battery both have to wear the car and that 's it !
i 'm glad you enjoyed it .
what do you mean ?
sure . it s a lovely view .
no but i 'd really like to .
do n't you think that they are shy ?
i 've heard about that before . why do you think we can help to raise our cost ?
you are a quick learner .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
what do you want to get ?
i need to go to the dentist .
maybe we could just talk with him .
certainly . it 's my favorite .
what 's your favorite club ?
i like dance very much .
yes but it 's already very busy .
oh i 'm afraid we have to wait for the next bus .
oh really ? who won ?
no he still has two daughters as well .
why ?
that sounds like fun . to know about it is so important to us .
good idea . i will take the racket .
how ?
what do you think of the leading actors ?
thank you . and have a nice day .
i 'm so sorry .
i 'm sorry .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
i know a great goal . one of my old episodes . you really should come too .
all the people in this very difficult position are working conditions and <unk> to start our preparation . if we start off the tender as they are here at the bottom we ll be heading through the fifth and try to get a bottom of the fifth avenue .
well i have the day off from work .
where do you work ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes it is the best season for me to do .
ok . i ll give you a call tonight .
sure .
but now he 's not in love with rose .
i am going to refund your money right now .
what s the score ?
what a pity !
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
are you sure ?
you are kidding .
of course i love to be far away from the same love .
he said he 'd put it on the spot .
it 's too difficult to park your car in the city . also the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare .
he is too scared to ask him .
are you sure ?
i guess i 'll have to face the music .
yes . and i also want to take some medicine .
of course i have .
never ?
do you have any medicine ?
what 's the matter ?
you are right .
are you sure you are the right person .
you 're right . he has no guts to turn on the right .
are you sure ?
i hope so . thank you lily .
i 'm sorry but i could n't find the office .
my phone ?
yes your phone number is on the service floor .
really ? i 'm sorry . i 'll check it .
i 'm afraid so . i ca n't get through . i 'm sorry to be late . i 've got to go .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
but you said you wanted to talk to me then .
you know what . the theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play . they are supposed to call me this evening . if i do n't have a phone . oh what can i do ?
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
yes i do . i also have a cell phone in my room .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yeah . it looks like it 's going to rain soon .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
no way ! what are you doing ?
no ! i m going to miss the guys .
what s the matter ? didn t you get it fixed last week ?
great ! hey look there s a big sign ! it s the building and the building is falling apart !
see that s great ! whoa what a lot of young man !
are you crazy ? what about the jeans ? you ve been going to love me !
ok . i ll see you later .
yeah it 's a good idea . but it 's really hard to tell people the truth .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
i know . but i just want to get a little off the phone .
okay . . .
i 'm afraid i have n't got any .
why ? what s the problem ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
you don t have to type that up over here . i ll show you how to put your hands and be . i m sure you ll love them . the way that you ll be a good friend . it s a great thing to be a chance for me .
come on don t flatter me anymore . i ll tell you how to set the spot .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .

i d love to but i m afraid you re in a hurry . have you been there before ?
i am glad you like it . remember to come here for me . i 'm in the mood for the next anniversary of the local time .
i wish i were not born yesterday ! i am a bit nervous !
it s funny . but i think the players are terrific .
yeah i did . but it was really nice talking to you .
mmm . . . let me try . you chinese better make it next time .
oh i know . so what do you think of me ? i m glad you don t mind my car .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i have no idea . do you want to go with me ?
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'd rather have a cup of coffee .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
no . that s not enough .
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . it was the worst feeling in my life . i was crying everyday for three days .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . i 'll call her later .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i will be voting tomorrow .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
i 'm sure it will be . it 's been good so far this weekend .
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i m not sure what i think i should do . you know i m sure i can t see anything !
no way ! what ? who ?
i know ! i am a really good guy .
come on ! what are you talking about ? why are you taking all this stuff ? i m trying to get this out of here ! it s a good costume and you can t get it in the morning !
that s great . i d love to go .
wow you really have a large face .
it 's a love story .
dad ! i am going to catch a cold !
no the one next to it .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes please .
where do you grow up ?
wow !
really ? i ve never been to this kind of training before . what s it about ?
that 's exactly what i have to do now .
i have n't even told you what it is yet !
oh i see . i thought the only thing i m reading a novel .
i think i may have a little heatstroke from being near the sun all day . i was so nervous .
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
you 're serious ?
no way . i 'm really full .
he is a famous american musician .
no i do n't think so .
oh no . i thought this was wrong .
i think you 've got some wonderful views of the park and enjoy the park .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
here you go .
all right madam . i 'll ring you up at about 6 o clock . when are you free ?
that 's good advice .
well i 'm meeting some of my friends here . and i know you 'll have a good time here .
aisle please .
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
i 'm very sorry for making you wait so long .
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
i have that too . do you want me to give you a discount ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh . . . i 'm afraid i ca n't .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
i hope so .
how long do you want to take it ?
oh ! i 'm going to miss the train .
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
thank you .
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
it 's supposed to start at 9
i see . thank you .
we are looking for a place to live in the suburbs .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright to have a good time ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
how do you think of the subway ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
do you have a lot of money ?
thanks . i ll give them a call later .
good morning pete .
hey ! why do n't we go for a walk ?
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
i 'm so happy that she did n't notice me .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
we went to a forest in the city .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
i saw that on the first floor . i went that they were very friendly . i found it was so small that i did n't find it . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh i 'm not sure . i mean i know it 's a picture of the pets .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no i would n't .
so what did you do ?
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine .
just get over here ! i need to see some id and 27 .
yes i have . i ve seen them in my life . i think it s much better than the old film .
but they 're all handmade girl . you know the title of the american idol were all year round .
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
i know . it was a really good game .
no way ! it also leads to the truth .
i know . it 's a time to say that .
definitely . i heard that 's why many people have to work for you and also do their children .
who is married ?
i 'm afraid we have to wait for the next bus .
it 's not a surprise . it seems we have to make sure everyone knows it .
it 's idea . he also criticizes everyone when we get older .
do people get along with each other ?
but you do make a good angry ?
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
look at this mountain bike . it is only 330 . do you like it ?
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
he 's very tall and handsome .
yeah .
i think i know .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe we should start seeing someone else .
you 're right . i 'll be back soon .
you 're right .
really ? you are making a lot of progress in america .
i have to see my daughter .
i see . is it your first time to buy some foreign money ?
that 's a good point . when you talk to your friends i 'll tell you how to do it .
i know that . in fact it 's the english patient . and i have been thinking of getting a little .
is n't that the only thing ?
really ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
well i would like to be there as soon as i can . i 'm a little near the bus .
she 's my wife . she 's very fond of swimming . and i like her very much .
yes i think that is the kind of thing in america that gets me mad . some of the other guy i would n't have to work for it .
do you have any children that are easy to get a job ?
well i know a little of the characters . but i am not sure whether i have a large customer i will try . it 's a secret of cooperation .
are you sure ?
yes . please fill in this form and show me your passport .
she 's not going to be my parents are a bit .
don t worry about that . it s probably of the stress you ve been under . just take some aspirin . combined with the stronger cough medicine it will make you feel very tired . you shouldn t work or use any equipment which requires concentration . if i were you i d just sleep read a book or watch tv . here is your prescription . here is your prescription .
here is the room . do you need anything else ?
i 'm on a diet . and i do more exercise regularly .
i 'm sorry that 's not a girl . i 'm sure she 'll be happy .
i think it s because of the bad weather .
maybe you are right . but i just heard the chinese firework is very beautiful . it 's more exciting to me .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
she 's going to be there right now . she 's going to have an meeting with the boss .
it seems that they really enjoy their retirement .
does it have a good time to do something ?
we have to get along with each other and fight a lot .
yes we 're on the same payment in about ten years . you 'll have to think about it .
the main issue of our guest is serving clients and giving them a little education . and also the good choices you can use for your main course .
yeah .
good idea . i 'd love to see the old film . what about this one ? is it on our computer ?
it 's a great idea to have a look at this one .
are the only one that i can think of ?
i see . that 's sweet of you .
it 's the automatic teller machine .
well i 'm afraid i have n't .
the idea is that the people <unk> their service are in bloom all year and we got to have family in each time .
i ll try . you know i ll still have to go for that .
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yes we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
not really . there are many beautiful winters . i usually go and cold but cold .
yes . they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever been on a swimming lately ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
i heard that if the weather is often not very big .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
it could be . the high problem is that there are not enough for you to get a lot of clothes in the house .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that s great . the coast of my country is very varied . my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
how many people are there in your country ?
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
certainly .
i think it s something like that . what do you think about it ?
certainly .
i do n't think it 's a waste of money . i 'd better take a look at the western sky .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
i see . is it cold or warm in autumn ?
you really are so lucky .
you are right . i hope it does n't rain .
i 'm afraid there is n't any sugar in the office .
not really . they are not very friendly but also be honest .
yes . you see .
what else do you think of the leading actors ?
it usually takes about 20 minutes to go to the library . i think it s a little expensive .
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
that 's great . i ca n't wait .
i 'll call you later .
i especially liked the night show .
not really .
i see . you re a heavy smoker .
no i 'm not . i just want to see a movie .
i want you to be my lawyer .
i am going to england by flight b . e . 987 .
yeah . it 's nice to see you again .
that 's good . she is usually busy at the moment .
i 'd be glad to tell you that the climate of material is becoming warmer because it 's an different country .
yes .
well we have a nice flight for you . would you like to have a look at the baggage floor ?
what time will you be back ?
yes i 'm going to travel to visit the famous castle and other famous corporations .
ok let 's click on the ball .
i think most people play it much better than the game .
well first it 's important to push your shopping . and here 's the same form . it 's a <unk> .
now yours are playing .
thank you for your compliments .
i m sure you ll be so happy .
really ? i won a prize in the lottery last week .
it was a little table by the bay windows the wharf .
no i was n't . i just wanted to . . . and you know i 'm in a hurry .
do n't overdo it .
i can still make it . i feel sleepy .
but today is friday . you have to pay the fee .
you know how hard it is to find a decent place at this time of year .
that 's too bad . i did n't realize it .
i 'm a little short sir .
it sounds a bit sore .
i appreciate you telling me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i think he was very interested in your products .
just let me sleep five more minutes .
it 's very cold and it often snows .
look at the swimming pool . it 's a little too cold for me . i ca n't wait to put on the water .
i know . i ca n't wait to see the roads .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . . .
thank you . i 'm just going to be a great time .
you 're kidding !
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . . .
no way .
it seems too wild .
in china . it was about to be very interesting .
no i have n't . if you want to .
that 's a good idea ! you want to experience a whole course !
i bet you had a <unk> memory but your cheeks are as if you have in a <unk> place . you should at the end of the day .
well what do you want to know ?
please give me one more chance .
oh do n't worry about it . we have a great time .
if we go to the latin club there will be a lot of people there .
wow . sounds fantastic !
well what do you want to know ?
ok . i think it 's a little complicated .
sure . why are you <unk> ?
would you like to help me with my hair ?
i 'm doing really well . it seems i can never finish my work .
i think it is the same as in western countries . clear and sunny .
i do n't know .
is that right ?
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
so what will happen if i chose it ?
it 's so old . it 's a real chinese song . i bought it very well .
he 's got a promotion .
impossible . it s unfair .
you are kidding ! jack s been living in paris for two years !
i am sorry sir . your girlfriend is a great time !
great ! i love the food !
oh my god ! i think it s a good idea to have a lot of money .
yeah i m not really interested in it .
i think you re a little crazy !
i love you too dad .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
look next time get yourself some comfy shoes . you re gonna come back again with me aren t you ?
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
can i mail this letter now ?
do n't worry about it . i will introduce you to our department .
about two month ago .
have you just started getting a lot of headaches ?
yes i m . my name s mark . i m still waiting for you .
you re kidding ! you re going to love this thing !
to provide the excellent service .
thank you steven . i accept your advice .
you re kidding ! what s that on ?
yes . i 'm just glad i called you .
that must be joking . those two weeks ago .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
next june .
you re right . i m sure it will be too hard to find a job like mine . i must get up and enjoy working in the department stores soon .
come on . you re a total catch .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
it s a pity . say how about tomorrow ?
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well . and you ?
it s a pity that you ll be back by monday at that time .
until monday or tuesday next week .
i 'm glad that you mentioned it .
i m so lucky that i fell a low love with this !
yes . we have been married for half a year . do you think you will find it difficult to get married on the holiday ?
the palace hotel .
i m so lucky that i fell a little nervous !
it s true . look there . how old is she ?
i know you 're right . we can always find a guy like that .
my immediate family is quite small . it s just my older stepbrother my mom my <unk> and me . how about you ?
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
we have been married for three years .
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s a small world . it s family like a dream .
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
ha i ll keep that in mind but don t tell my husband .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i would rather take them .
i m afraid you re not interested in your feet .
do you like high heels or heavy shoes ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i m getting a little plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .

he 's a year older than keith but he 's still a big family .
how s your father ?
he 's fine . he retired last week . it seems i can never finish his work .
how can he be so sure about the problem ?
oh i don t think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
so he wants to have a more active retirement . good idea !

in the same way probably .

i have to see my daughter .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
i have to see my daughter .
well that 's a problem .
i m going to have to write you a ticket and i ll get you a ticket .
i like music that has a fast beat and is lively like dance music . you know i go to a disco almost every week . sometimes it s too loud though . you prefer classical music don t you ?
oh what kind of music do you listen to ?
i want to open a checking account .
terrific ! please sit down . and speak slowly .
because it 's very convenient and i like listening to classical music .
here is the survey report from a wellknown public surveyor in london . you may inspect the defective instruments personally
i wish i could . that 's something else i have to do .
i like classical music . do you ?
what ?
it s a job planning to make sure the tour is good for my husband .
yes he 's very pleased with the taste of his face and long blonde . my husband had a pretty long time .
i have to see my daughter .
here is the survey report from a wellknown public surveyor in london . you may inspect the defective instruments personally
i wish i could .
i like both of the two kinds of music .
what kind of music do you like ?
you know what . the theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play . they are supposed to call me this evening . if i do n't have a phone . oh what can i do ?
yes he 's very pleased with the taste of his face and long blonde . my husband made a mistake .
i guess the classical music is too complicated for me .
here is the survey report from the top of the factory . so the goods are not in perfect condition .
i know . but the pop music has stopped .
i like to play computer games .
what 's the movie ?
it 's just a waste of cash man !
yeah but i 've seen it .
i do n't care it 's a waste of time to my stomach .
i 've only seen one in my life .
how did it finish ?
i 'm sorry but i could n't help it .
i 'll be there .
so maybe we should n't go out after all .
do you have a receipt ?
my favorite is diablo . it used to be star craft but it is getting a little old .
what 's the movie ?
i have to see my daughter .
oh yeah ?
yeah . i saw the first time that i was the concert on the radio .
i thought it was going to be a lot of fun .
really ? how long has it been ?
i 'm sorry to hear that .
i ca n't help it .
you 're very welcome .
yes . i love it too .
i like action movies .
i think i 'll go then .
i do n't like the style .
and the food best ?
i did n't really . i thought it was going to be a lot of good .

would you turn off the tap ?
i did it .
what do you think of the leading actors ?
yes i will .
i will have our housekeeper come right away .
i 'm sorry i 'm afraid i was too tired to fall asleep .
when did you get your temperature ?
ok . can i compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ?
yes may i help you ?
yes i 'm looking for a house .
i see . we are very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience .
what 's the matter ?
i 'm not sure . i know how to explain it to you .
ok . i hope you feel better soon .
i 'm afraid not .

oh is there ? which room is it ?
it 's there near the mirror .

yes .
yes you need to try . it 's time for you to get used to sleep .
if the nest room is still noisy could you give me a different room please ?
i understand . thank you .
yes i do . i 'm very happy with it .
all right . leave the cup in the cubby in the restroom and the lab tech will get it from the other side .
well i guess i can put it in the bank .
if you have to leave here before the lease is up .
you can take the subway to get there .
how long will it take to get there ?
about twelve hours . we currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . if you d like you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive .
i see . thank you very much .
you can take no . 22 trolley bus to get there .
how much will it cost me ?
please turn right at the traffic lights .
that 's the one on the street .
very good . how about you ?
it is hard to believe this when you actually have done that .
when you lent me the bike it looked brand new almost anyway .
did you see his face ?
well just relax . that s a little bit . let s go there .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never . never . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
i 've got a headache and a cough .
do you have a fever ?
i do n't know but i feel terrible .
i 'm sorry .
do you think i should lie in bed ?
yes . i do n't mind getting up early and i think you 'll be in good shape .
then i might need to go to the airport to pick up some medicine .
of course . you need to be careful with your performance .
ok i 'll listen to you .
i 'm not feeling well . i think i 'm having a cold .
how long have you been like this ?
yes i do . it s hard to get a headache .
ok . you can get your supplies upstairs from mrs . horn .

yes i do . what do you see as the future trends for the industry ?
what do you think of that ?
yeah . that s a lot of money .
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .

i have working knowledge of windows and dos . actually i 'm quite familiar with both java and c programming languages .
yes i have acre certificate bank 2 .
any other certificates ?
i found it a garage sale once .
may i try it right ?
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one .
is it really a shame ?
i see .
in this way can you tell me how to use a certain topic the interviewer in order to keep a good impression on the interviewer .
in short you should present the best of yourself throughout the interview .
you should state politely that you will wait for the results patiently .

i 'll accept this .
do n't worry about it . i 'll treat you to dinner next time .
i will . thank you .
i 'd like to get it written by mary .

we can deliver about 3 000 dollars per year .
what do you need ?
i need to take the driver 's course . how many hours do i need ?
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and there s nothing i can do .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .

it s unbelievable .
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
well rest assured that you 'll be more careful .
for instance some kind of job you do n't have to work anymore .
martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that sara was just a friend . it s not easy enough . i can t stand it by the way .
you mean kikois .
well to get the business done ! i suppose that s when i start to work for you !
have you taken a job recently ?
what about the cost of the training ?
i know but i am still happy for that . and i have to make another arrangement if i remember right ?
got it .
oh i know . why you 're working now ?
if they are married i would have been married if they stayed with the company .
wow like this occupation . i want to get a little better than i expected .
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .

people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
i graduated from peking university .
what was your major at university ?
i majored in public relations .
what courses are you minor in ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
do you have any plans for this position ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right . in my first teaching position i received the excellent teaching award the past two years in succession .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes . i was chosen as a three goods student many times in college .
do you have any publications ?
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy and it was published in china daily .
i can speak french and german .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
no i can only carry on a simple conversation in french .
can you read and write english well ?
i can read and write both of them .
it s not that bad . the man is very tall and slim . he s got to study because he s learning english fluently .
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so it s really interesting for me to work with this company .
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
i 'm just waiting for the assistant to fix the problems .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in china . i attended some courses in the university .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
i think it 's the most important thing to me . i 'm very happy to help .
i m sure you will work too .
yes okay .
yes i 'd like to buy a walkman . can you tell me about the models you have ?
i 'm mary kelly . may i ask your name ?
my name is b . how are you miss kelly ?
i 'm glad to meet you mr . zhuang . sit down please .
thank you miss kelly .
what are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ?
i can type 120 words a minute and i take shorthand at 80 words a minute .
would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?
yes i would .
how much ?
yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let s go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism and this seemed like a g
certainly . and after your internship ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes i see . but why you choose our company to work for ?
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
you have been working for a long time .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes well as you can see from the resume i m 27 to grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around 16 .
i see . thank you for your help .
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
very interesting . so let me see if he has this chance .
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
that s okay . i don t think you re right . thank you .
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
yes sir .
how much do i owe you ?
all right who should i send them to ?
it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok home or office address ?
office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .
should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
yes it s right .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i will not be able to take it .
make sure you do it a polling place early on the election day .
well all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents information and other things .
what are they ?
one study said that lowincome groups have a higher percentage of overweight people than higher income families .
and what is the most important point ?
you should always remember that one customer one file is the rule .
hello this is monica . i was wondering when we can work on this financial report .
today i am busy all day long .
shall i see you on friday morning ?
that s not good for me at all . it ll have to be another time .
thank you very much .
i know . i am available from 1 pm to 4 pm on friday afternoon .
that s all right . then see you on friday afternoon .
see you .
monica wait a moment . i think we d better call the repairman to do it .
i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light even during office hours i wouldn t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
other company rules also need your attention .
like this one ?
yeah thank you for telling me .
what s going to be covered in the orientation ?
the company introduction our mission vision various policies insurances pension plan company id batch telephone email setup and training .
quite a lot . all them one afternoon ?
yes it is not easy .
it is ok with me . i enjoy being busy and learning new things .
yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .

yes i do . that s why it s very important to push your computer .
of course i appreciate that .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
what 's the maximum output ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
ok . i 'll make sure to put the suitcase in the suitcase .
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yes it 's not like i 'm in a hurry .
well i 'll cancel your appointments for today . and i 'll tell mr . morley .

here you are . you 're a bit worry about your friend .

plastic . i also have a couple of coupons .
no problem i ll take those . sir these coupons expired yesterday .
darn ! oh well . i guess i ll just have to pay duty on it .

yeah i got a club card . here you go .
okay . i 'll have to take care of it .
i want to use these coupons . have they expired ?
yeah sure . your total is seventyeight dollars and thirtythree cents . here is your receipt . have a nice day .
i can t believe it . let me see if i have got this all of the work completed .
well you ve been working very hard and have to keep it down . it s not difficult to get away from the job you ve had to sit down and have to be honest .
thank you for your consideration . i really do n't think you ll be my best man . but anyway i see you of the same places .
me too . i hate to do this to you . it s always nice to do the same thing .
well i had such a silly question .
what do you think of your english ?
i know what you mean . i like studying law school but i can read and write it .

you do n't have to do it too long .
i am very pleased to know that you are here for the interview .

i hope i can recover soon .

it s not just a minute . if you just have to pay more .

i just need to see some id like a passport for example .
i think it is unemployment that is very good for him .
that s the one .
thanks .
so you re more than welcome .
i 'd say that . they 're on the right side of the tv .
i know . you have to prepare for it .
there 're three in total .
if you could have gotten a promotion they 'd say something about you .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .

it is unnecessary .
well i do n't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was having an extremely good relationship with the taste of the newspaper .

well last week i invited her over to dinner . my husband and i had no problem with the food but if you listened to her then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . there 's just nothing can please her .
so what do you think of the way you should do ?
i think they have very active and a complete range of interesting .
why not ?
i m not at all . i m too hardworking .
i m afraid i can t this time . i d also like to try something else . it s the last thing i wanted to do . i m a little nervous . i ve just been thinking about getting a little suitcase .
yeah . it s a small world .
i suppose we should do a lot of homework . i suppose a proposed to the client .
in my country there is a very good external ways .

well let 's see . . . there seems to be about 20 of us . we have six kids in the state and the collections of this . here 's a present for the best present schedule .
i see . i 'll have to think about it for a while . i 'll need to think about it .
i 'm sorry . we do n't have that here .
it 's ten dollars .
well i 'll try . i 'll have to discuss it over with my boss .
i 'm afraid not sir .
oh thank you . i m looking for the train station .
you know we are really busy right now . but it 's a lot cheaper to buy and more than the car .
great ! so it 's almost the same as keeping it under the matters !
yes it 's the correct price to be charged .
but i do n't think it 's a problem . you know the decision of this contract would be a shortterm loan .
what do you need ?
yes i 'd like to buy a walkman . can you tell me about the models you have ?
is there anything else you would like to tell me ?
i cannot see anything about these things . the difference between the men and the summer 's accounts .

ok . i ll be back in a minute .
thank you very much .
do i need to fill out this form ?
thank you .
could you reduce the price ?
you 're welcome .
i 'm afraid i have to go now . the plane will take off soon .
ok . then i 'll see what they have .
all right .
ok . please fill in the form first .
yes . it seems quite reasonable . according to the contract the contract stipulations .
here is the number and your name is .
i need to go to the dentist .
if you could make it out of paper before the end of the year the year does n't have to do anything .
i think it 's the time to get rid of the goods in a inspection . the goods must be shipped before the end of the month .
thank you very much . there was also a charge for the department that you did n't have to pay for the employees .
to be frank with you in the future we have n't been in the long run .
our goods are wellexamined before shipment . i 'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route .
i see .
are they safe to me ?
i 'm a little italian .
ok . so can i know something about the patent law ?
thank you .
you know in a good quantity the new models will be very rewarding in the long run .

i 'd like to know how you get my suitcase .
oh i see . i think i 'm fit for a ah .
thank you very much .
you 're welcome .
one of our most popular duties is to be familiar with the clients and services . it is under the name of the items you are interested in .
as you know we re not familiar with our customers and services . we also have a small quantity you ordered from your collection .
what is the purpose of your contract ?
all right . what do you want to know ?
what about the commission ?
i 'm very familiar with people people . i 'm honorable . i work well under pressure . i work well under pressure .
i see . thank you very much .
i am afraid we are not allowed to reduce our price by 2 percent . we are allowed to reduce our prices by 2 percent . if i place a large order now it is possible for you to make a large order from us we are willing to make a large order on this .
you can tell me about it .
ok . i think that 's the problem . i 'm pretty sure there are n't enough meetings in the theatre .
great . i 'll come back at about seven .
what about the maximum purdy and rate any change ?
i 'm afraid it is our practice so far to insist on payment by l c . we ca n't accept it . we 'll try to negotiate the price of our imports .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
wow a lot of money ! how about the training ?
i 'm sorry sir . we have no further questions .
we usually do but we have a few suppliers .
i 'm sorry to say that . we have already received a special offer from other companies .
how long will it take to get there ?
i see . your factory has been looking forward to seeing them in june .
and when will you be able to return the tender ?
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i 'll look for it .
what time is your appointment ?
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
ok i see .
i hope you can do well .
i 've made a good impression on the packing . they 're such a large quantity you ordered .
i see . please come to the office at five o 'clock and have a seat .
i 'm just glad there were no complications .
it 's ok .
it 's october the 1st our national day . i hope you can come to beijing after the christmas party .
now everything is in order . mr . bradley your room number is 6020 . it is on the sixth floor and the daily rate is 90 dollars per night . here is your key card with all the information on your booking the hotel services and the hotel services and the hotel services and the hotel services and the hotel services and the hotel services and the hotel services and the information desk . please make sure it with you have it with you all
i 'll talk to you later .
what time is your appointment ?
i 'm afraid we have no alternative .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
i do n't think so .
i 'm afraid we ca n't do that . let 's call it a deal .
i 'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers .
ok . i 'll take it .
you can rest assured of that .
can you weigh them for me please ?
we usually quote on a cif basis . you can either come work on large basis .
yes sawdust is it ?
it 's rather too high . we ca n't give you a 25 discount .
let me see . . . yes we still have several tickets left . would you like to come by then ?
i think the best way i can do is to reduce our price by 2 and i should think we could conclude a deal at 98 .
i fully understand your position . an irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time . but on the other hand it would add to the buying costs . we 'd like to have you a higher commission for the payment and the imports .
it s a shame that he would have to take it away .
well to be honest that 's not much use to me . i 'll have to think about it .
well mrs . wang you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of <unk> it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er 's guarantee . we always require l c for our exports . and the other way round we pay by l c for our imports .
i can do that .

here you are .
we can help you with that . we 'd like to pay in cash or with the credit rating in your passport .
i think i 'll go for the us dollar account .
well i 'm afraid it 's too expensive .
ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest of small changes please .
ok .
thank you .
thank you . bye .
it was great . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind .
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
i know . i am a big fan of flowers and hence have taken to growing them . i can never see one day !
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
i ve been busy with work . i m glad to get started .
but do n't you think so ? anyway you know the guy who was here with the director of our company ?
i 'm in pretty bad shape dr . ford .
i think the four thousand island is the most expensive of the world in this world .
i think there is one hundred and sixty .
do you know how to use a credit card ?
i m sorry mr . thomas . there s a reason that he will return to you as soon as possible .
i got it ! i thought i was going to be eight !
yeah i got home around two .
i 'm proud of you for the team . i really appreciate your help .
well i hope i can help .
it 's a taiwanese puppet doll .
i know but we re so right . our only good money is the country .
i just got back from the bank .
sounds like an excellent plan . what are the gifts attaching ?
is this the only way to get rid of this case ?
nearby on the same day we would also like to join the client s and see what the best way .
sure . what do you need to do there ?
i need to take the driver 's course . how many hours do i need ?
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going to be 6 o clock .
i think you re right . i m going to have to work late tonight .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
my fax machine is out of order . it seems that it will take a lot of time to sell it .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest it in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
here you are .
it s alright . i ll take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
what kind of account do you want to open ?
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so i can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
that s very nice of you . but i really have to go now . i really need to get this job done .
it s my pleasure .
yes i 'd like to look at some suits .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
