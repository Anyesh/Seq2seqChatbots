tom has gone to lunch .
our cars for one month .
do you think this music is warm matched ?
oh that means i ca n't make sure for my own .

there is no one here by that name .

i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
noirin noirin it 's an irish name .

how many nights a week is it ?
it s going to be 25 .

ok . here you are . several minutes later than the bus .

what is that ?
is there any difference ?
i think it 's fairly good .

an throat test is inflamed . and a fever has an ice cream .
hmm . . . i think it s not too expensive . maybe i can take it .
yes .
are you ready to transfer tomorrow ?
silly me .
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
that 's wonderful .
i 'll give you five more minutes then i 'm going on without you !
yes i did . do you want to go with me ?

i 'm sorry it was too cold and i had a bad start .
be careful .
i know you have a good time .

is there any wrong ?
yes . no need to change .
how far is it ?
you re welcome .
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?

your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .

that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that might be going overboard a bit . how about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . ok i 'll take it .
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing .
that s even better than the real thing .
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than 100 you get a 50 voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
sure . the fitting room is right over there .
yes i 'm looking for a house .

that 's something that you really need to work on .
can we have a ticket for the <unk> flight ?
yes i can . i m very interested in some positions in their market .
not really . the company has always been going on for a while .
i want to try on this pair .
the round shape pair ?
what sports do you like best ?
well you have fun .
i agree how much ?
you just said 10 rounds .
no that 's okay i already have a coke . why do n't you have a seat you look like you 've been on your feet all day .

no problem . i ll wait .
what do you mean by that ?
you 're welcome .
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
well you can say that . i think you will like the food there .
that 's very kind of you .
i 'm not sure yet . there 's one on the menu .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
um this steak i asked for to be medium rare .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
is she chubby ?
what did you do ?
that 's because you 're done . and you 've done a lot of homework .
one moment . do you want to withdraw some cash while you 're at it ?
i have read . you re currently writing a business card .
what do you think of the leading actors ?
tell me what you want to do .
are you scared of anything ?
would you mind waiting a moment ? i 'll check your order .

may i know what you do ?
so then why do n't you drive it ?
is there anything else you would like ?
i ve got it .
oh you do ?
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
you wo n't be late . i just want to stay at home and have a good rest for work .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
why ?
let 's take a cab .
that 's fine . i 'd like to have the room ready for the air .
yes . why do n't we go ?
no i have n't even done that in a while .

would you say the floor is a suite for 4 people ?
i 'm glad to hear that . she has been in a long time .
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it s about an hour .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
all right .
hello this is smith from 1308 can you add something to the office ?

what are you talking about ? what happened ?
have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
well i 'm not sure if i can sleep well . but i think it 's too late .
you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
you are welcome .
how about oil or spray ?
sure . how about the hotel ?
how much money do you want to transfer ?
how about tomorrow afternoon ?
so you want to send it by air ?
your flight takes off at 8
can you tell me what meetings you want to check in ?
i 'm sorry . thank you .
yes . my manager sent me in there 's a problem with the shipping time . it 's been delayed quite significantly and my manager is unwilling to accept it .
is it used to protect yourself ?
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
i 've never had a mango .
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
we can do this from secret .
mangoes ? what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
can you eat the seed ?
no peel the skin with a sharp knife and throw out the seed .
maybe i could interest you in buying something from a good choice .
it 's 150 yuan a day .
but i 'm afraid it 's too expensive . can you show me something cheaper ?
what are you thinking ?
why not ?
where do they grow mangoes ?
well how can i get them ?
most of them in this store are from mexico .
well we just got in some mangoes .
mangoes . what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .

no you peel off the skin and throw out the nut .
how much are they ?
well the sale price is 1 each .
what does a mango taste like ?
they 're like a citrus fruit .
how do i know if it 's ripe ?
you can buy them hard . wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel .
where do they come from ?
most of them in this store are from mexico .
well we 've got some great mangoes on sale .

sounds like a good car ! how many miles to the gallon ?
it is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway .
that is really convenient . especially now that fuel prices are so high ! what s under the hood ?
a very powerful 2 . 5 liter turbocharged engine trust me this car is fast !
now for the most difficult question . what is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?
very affordable sir . you can take it out of this lot today with 0 down payment and no interest for the first year ! you can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .
very well .
what are you getting ?
well the first thing on my list is a new blender . i decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker .

wangfujing please !

i 'm completely lost . i 'm trying to find the way to my daughter 's home .
it 's about 40 .
oh i see .
please fill out the form .
yes i do .
hello madam . where to ?
a oneway ticket to chicago please .
oh thank you . will you be able to see us at the airport please ?
i 'm completely lost . i 'm looking for the empire state building .
1 500 yuan . how will you pay ?
here is ten yuan .
it 's a private garden .
this will fix all of the best . did you try to get the party ?
that comes to four dollars and ten cents .
why do you have an appointment ?
thank you .
hello . is there anything i can do for you ?
yeah of course . let me help you .
thank you . where should i send your final phone bill ?
yes i 'm . i 'm just putting them on my books and my books .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
all right but i have to do it for you .
see you then .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
12000 a year but you ca n't get visitors to live in .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
i m glad to hear that .
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop stop stop . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello steven !
wow what a surprise !
it was almost an hour ago .
i 'm fine thanks .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
well take it easy !
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
ok i will . if you do n't mind i 'll call you when you get back .
thank you very much .
do n't you hit it off ?
i began to went there last month .
i see .
i had a terrific working relationship with my boss even though we are very different people . because i 've had a number of bosses i 've come to realize that to make things work you have to understand what 's important to your boss . then you have to do everything you can to support him or her . it 's natural to think about your own
what is her strongest trait ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it 's mostly nausea and a fever .
why ? i do n't believe he was equally successful when he was a kid .
what happened ?
see you then .
but i 'm not sure how to get there . i 'll be able to come .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
i can give you this ride my car . i ll take you the car .
you know what happened ! what are you doing when i do ?
yeah ! i can t believe that ! do you think we can make it another time ?
what should i do then ?
do you think we can get a lot of money ?
i 'm just shopping . something else ?
some of my friends play cards on the internet . you 'll be there for christmas .
i know i know . i can t bear to look at it !
i m looking for a sweater .
what s in it ?
i ll need a few pairs of each . how much is that ?
what s up ?
yes that 's quite an excellent one . according to the article the countries have quite a few experiences .
no i do n't have any help .
thank you .
oh so you re from south america .
thanks a lot . my wife said it was nice .
ok . do you know how many copies you want ?
hmm . . . this is a really good one . it has n't been all that great .
let s see . that doesn t sound too good !
and how is it used to you ?
here you are .
well it looks like you have a caught on the toilet .
that s right sir .
thanks for telling me .
no problem john .
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
is this salami and bologna you have here ?
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
we want to look at some of your products .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes .
is it gonna be here ?
so what can we do for you ?
well it has been very helpful . the manager will come in and get back to me tomorrow . i can t wait to hear from her .
so let s have a look at it this afternoon .
it sure is . you can take part in the future .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
what size are you ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's no hot water after 10 at night . sometimes i like to have a hot shower before bed . especially in the winter . it feels good .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s a great idea to have a balcony with the air .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
here s an interesting ad for rent .
i have n't thought of that .
yes it has two bedrooms . that 's convenient .
it s nice .
the ad says 325 plus deposit .
that s way too much .
you re going to kick out a computer .
what do you mean ?
let me see . a roasted duck is 15 dollars . a plate of pork is 10 dollars . two bottles of beer are 4 dollars . that ll be 10 dollars . that ll be a total of 34 dollars .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you please reconsider ?
okay . i could use the atm .
i m afraid not . but i really don t want to miss the help .
yes . i like cooking very much . i got this hobby when i was 12 years sold .
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah . i like the bamboo design of food . it is very popular .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
do you want your measurements ?
i 'll take one of these suits . what price did you have ?
the compact is a good idea . i am sure that one can do it .
i need to think about the price . how much is it ?
it s my treat . i really like the color .
ok i ll show you how . you ll be working with the director of your company .
don t worry . i ll take some as soon as i get them back . the latest model is very soft and keep up .
the red one fits me well . can i try it on ?
what else do you want ?
the dress is slim .
even if you like to go to the interview you will have time to read the books out .
oh i remember . it s very nice talking with you .
yeah you 're speaking . how can i help you ?
i was wondering if there 's a room available .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i believe that this apartment would be great .
i will be glad to hear it .
that sounds good . i will see you then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
no i 'm just browsing . thanks .
yes .
should i bring anything with me ?
no but if you need to check your driver 's license just get some id card .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
but the price has been reduced by 50 . it s a real bargain .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it 's fully furnished .
the house is so quiet and peaceful .
i can t agree more .
with so few windows how can you even see what the problems are ?
that 's a nice dark .
i really appreciate it .
did you check the luggage before getting in ?
how do you spell it ?
only one .
great ! well it is from here in the mountains with our clients on the market .
let s sign it for you .
what was it about ?
which website is this ?
yes it 's a great idea . i can go on the motor and put you down for a few minutes .
wow ! this place is really nice . it s so beautiful !
i thought it might rain .
thank you .
it s made of pure gold .
i am sorry . he 's having an important meeting now . can i help you ?
i am . what can i do for you ?
do you have any idea how much that would cost ?
you bet . i think that 's the problem .
let 's go .
i have no problem with 6 p . m .
if you could just give me your phone number .
i 'm sorry . i 'll have to meet you .
we have a deal with an area of journalism and a very expensive place .
should i bring anything with me ?
no but if you can think of anything else just get it .
yes i 'm looking for a house .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
yes please .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
oh i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
do you know how short you want your hair to be ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
thank you mr . jones .
yeah right here is the coffee .
how about your hair ?
no problem . i think it 's just a little tight .
what style do you want ?
i hope so . i 'm not very sure if that i can find something wrong with it .
i can help you with that . by the way i 'll check my job and i 'll give you a call .
no you put it on your arm and cut it back .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yes i do .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
no that was mean to say . i do n't think it 's that serious .
oh i see . and what kind of sports do you like best ?
i like that .
it 's smashed in .
thanks . that 's a good idea .
yes . we have free service on weekends .
ok . when i check with the others i will email you . do you have any other questions ?
all right . i think you 've done a good job . how do you like it ?
that 's probably a good idea .
oh yes . that 's why i came here . i think you 're right .
so what have you been doing ?
ok . i ll help you with the food there .
i ca n't believe it !
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
ok . i ll be there by the house then .
yes you do . we always do have problems with the design .
yes . i work in a cubicle too .
where is it ?
how long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?
ok . i will look for a new apartment on for you .
is that very convenient ?
where is it ?
did you get the goods on the dogs or at the mall ?
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
let s go check out the kitchen next .
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
actually i think about it 's the time to buy some from the government . if you go there how about the government and money you can afford .
sure . i will send you a note of the white house in the afternoon .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
how about some burgers ?
i prefer sea food .
do you know where i want to eat chinese food ?
i 'm not sure .
well it looks very nice .

was there a discount taken ?
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
but the ads say they are spending a lot of money on tv .

first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
yes . what 's on ?
i do n't have any idea what to cook .

i do n't have the slightest clue .
this ca n't be the right stop .

well i 'll see how it is .
why do n't you give them a suggestion ?

on the second floor .

right now i 'm watching it .
i 'm going to need you to fill out the tank .
do n't you have the arresting officer in the courtroom ?
yes i do .

i guess you can call the police if you want .
thank you .
for what ?
i believe that he will take good care of our country .

let 's take a look at the bus .
in such as long as you are careful reading the signs you will always know how long you can park and what days are ok to park there . are you aware of the curb colors ?
yes . i 've never seen the city before .
oh no . i think you 'll be a good politician .
i like it but there is a lot of room .
yes . we will send someone out to see the apartment .
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
i really don t understand what the big deal is .
please pay some money .
what you would like me to do about it ?

we are on the top floor .
that 's my job !
how do i get it ?
what date will you be taking up ?
go to work everyday .
well do n't you know for sure ?
i was reading about how some people get tricked or <unk> in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed !
the bucky card is a great way for you to save money while you have a good time here .
i think so .
remember that you do n't have any action movies .
that 's true and we have been on this bus for a while .
what is it ?
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials ignite it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .
yes . i ca n't believe it . there are so many good places to live in .
well . . . i 'm just waiting for the assistant manager . she 's satisfied with this company .
when we go here we have to get one of the city and change the number forty minutes .
not good . i lost my wallet .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
what can i do for you today ?
i have no idea where to get off .
o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room sir ?
not much . i walk to work .
you have your own vehicle ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
do n't you feel dull ?
it 's very convenient and cheap .
thank you . do you want to add some more information about your products ?
we can get both at the cafeteria .
can you give me a rough idea of the better ?
oh it is already 1000 degrees outside . if you like us you do n't want to be late .
why ? you make me confused .
sure it 's a <unk> .
how much do you have ?
i got a sandwich from the cafeteria .
i ca n't believe it .
yes i mean it .
i am glad that you think so .
i 'm okay with you .
hi peter . how are you ?
oh i was just watching tv . what about you ?
that 's great ! so it 's a pity that you are a good accountant .
yes .
this song is beautiful .
yes i did .
you like the food there .
i think that i might have been the best teacher .
i see . how do you feel about that ?
sorry to say that i have caused you so much trouble .
good . i am sure you will like them .
thank you very much . by the way how can i get bob to help ?
i am working on my family . why do you want to go ?
if there 's nothing i can do about ten minutes . i will send my family to get it to you on friday .
that is good to know . you can go to the church and buy a new bar in the afternoon .
what happened ?
sometimes it 's just not as bad as you do .
all right i will explain it to you later on .
but i ca n't speak to your language well .
i know but this is a bad things .
this is all right .
of course . how do you want to know ?
my paper is on the influence of television on children .
what 's your favorite dance ?
how do i get it ?
what can i do for you ?
i 've been feeling pretty well these days .
it seems that you have been a full range of energy .
i was robbed .
you see . i think it was nothing serious .
what ?
i thought this was the right stop .
i think i want to try a new style .
oh but it is too hard to forget .
i have been studying . i will try my best to get a job .
i know how you feel . i thought you were right at my fault .
no i have n't . i 've decided i m going to travel very light this time .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
next month .
i like business management .
what 's your favorite dance ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
well there s nothing else i can do for you .
what 's the matter
the food station was as crowded as usual . i waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich and when i finally got it the chicken was underdone .
well you have to take it easy . the pay is good .
do n't be too upset . it s not the end of the world .
well you know me . i 'll prepare it for you .
great . thanks .
fine ! how are you ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
well i 'm an english major . i came here to the united states but i 'm taking it again .
i 'm an <unk> .
i see . do you have any idea how much that would cost ?
i 'll keep you waiting .
apparently you have unpaid late fees .
certainly it 's my pleasure .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
thanks professor .
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
i have the confidence in the paralegal profession . i 've always been here for the past two years .
not always . but if you want to take a class during the class you should n't have enough time and write down on right away .
so what do you think about it ?
that 's all right .
i am worried about the meeting this morning .
do you have any passport or motorbike ?
i see .
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
do i need a money order for 250 dollars ?
english and western language .
i really want to hear about this . i think it 's worth a lot of money .
we can take the subway . it 's not far from here .
how long will it take to get there ?
let me guess .
that must have been very large . a insects dress in your country . but a lot of historical figures there .
do you think it s a good idea to have a look at this restaurant ?
i 'll plan for going back to australia .
you re going to take courses ?
yes i 'm going to take some university courses there .
sounds hard .
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
okay . i 'll see you again next time .
yes i 'm serious . i 'm too busy to work .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
of course . it 's on memorial avenue .
that sounds fine . thanks a lot .
you can check out two books at a time .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
for two weeks . after that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer .
i see . thank you very much for your trouble .
sure . no problem . thank you .
does it suit me ?
you re welcome .
my name is sam . what 's yours ?
it 's smith . here is my driver 's license .
i 'm very nice meeting you too .
no . i 'm from taiwan . i 'm just glad to get around .
can i help you ?
maybe i 'll see you again . how did your flight go ?
a lot . i suppose this was a good idea . what kind of games do you know ?
is that right ? oh i 've already been in london now .
why ? it 's amazing that they have a good time .
i 'm going to visit . you see .
how he likes that and it 's a great pity that we did n't have a child in america .
and it 's a very cool game too .
really ? so you just took them once in a while ?
wow ! i 'd really like to . i have heard there are many famous attractions in france .
thank you .
i was n't able to attend the class this week .
good . is there anything wrong ?
i want to take a driver 's course .
have you figured out the problem ?
it 's not so bad .
you 're a good student .
i 'm going to take a driver 's course .
do you know anything else ?
i see . did you enjoy studying english ?
yes now i 've heard of that one by the window . . .
did she take any advice ?
i think so . he is the most important thing .
you think he 's a bit shy ?
i have my book from class here .
also mr . smith you 'll be aware that you have seen the office in advance .
i took a parttime job last semester in translating and doing reception work for an exhibition .
i 'm glad you enjoyed it .
do you think that 's a good idea ?
you mean you 're trying to lose weight ?
of course not . actually i got a parttime job in college . i learned english three years ago .
is n't it too bad ? the economy has been good .
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind .
did you guys go on a date already ?
yeah how happened ?
i hope not . the problem is that you do n't want to tell her to call miss any problems .
it 's so nice of you to say so .
well i took all my courses such as philosophy logic ethics aesthetics etc .
is n't that a bit too bad . it would be cheaper to take a look at the market .
did you go a little bit too far ?
it was n't as high as i would have liked . it was 2 . 5 .
really ? it was a great game .
i do n't know . i went to the church church last sunday . they were supposed to call me this morning .
did you guys go on a date already ?
i think i caught a cold .
what was the score ?
i must go and get off .
hi .
who s the matter ?
i went to malaysia and thailand .
for example the past two years i came to the <unk> 's degree .
is that right ?
is there anything else wrong with it ?
i see . are you doing other people on the weekends ?
in california is n't it ?
oh really ? it 's a good mother .
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
what kinds of work were she thinking about ?
yeah so i think she is suitable for you .
i have always wanted to offer you great news .
we 'll cost you about ten thousand dollars .
that 's not all right . i guess we 'll get to the office by 6 .
oh yeah it 's just the luck i like doing . i 'm very excited about this .
no i d like to go by myself .
i do n't think so .
yes i did .
are you a class student ?
i 'm going to need to take a driver 's course .
let me see . oh yes . that 's the exact information you are reading . which one is the exact place you want to go to ?
which subject did you choose ?
well it is so nice of you to get me through the phone . and i am willing to pay two cash and the balance in the the card .
yes he does . he 's coming from <unk> on the way to the train station .
i hate to tell you this place .
good luck .

that sounds good .
what else would you like ?
oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
there is a shop in the corner . go ahead please .
it is very famous in her .
yes . there is one on the other side of the building .
i can tell you if you 'd like .
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i am worried .
what about ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
oh is that all ?
i feel very nervous about it .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i hope to get a ba in english literature but it is an exciting city in beijing .
i understand .
do you have any work experience as a guide ?
i remember that someone was able to get along with this area . i was able to overcome my experience and work well with the people from another company .
what ? what are you talking about ?
i agree with you on that . but i think we can make it more interesting .
what do you mean ?
that s okay i am trying to sell something . do you have the other suggestion ?
i think you re right . there are always some chinese dishes .
ok .
i m fine .
what can i do for you today ?
i need to get a passport .
what do you need ?
do you know how to turn them on ?
did you check the periodicals ?
i didn t even bother to think of that .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
i see .
sure it will take me to get the book .
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
but the bank is always so thin !
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
did you go to the top of the eiffel tower ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to cancel a check .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
can you show me which charges you re referring to ?
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call the police as soon as possible .

i think it 's much better than that .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
that sounds like a good idea .
no . i thought the difference was .
no problem . there are n't any problems .
sorry can i stop it ?
i ll pick you up at . . . say seven thirty ?
no i ve already got a short time . this one is for me and i need to take a course at the university .
ar yes . there s a big cavity .
sure company rules are not very strict at this point .
ok . i hope so .
it takes most of the time for the stuff you buy online to arrive . but if you do n't have to worry about it another form you can change the products by doing it .
i 'm glad to hear that . what impressed you most ?
sure . i will try you to call the boss and tell him how you feel .
i don t think i m wrong with him .

no i will try to read them next time .
okay what can i get you ?
i 'm sorry .
they 're on the shelf .
yes . in this case we 'll keep the promise of the promise .
should we walk ?
anything else ?
do you have anything else i can have instead ?
a lot of money do n't you know ?
in fact mr . mechanic and i was born to difference .
moblogging is a combination of the people on the north of china . it means that we can use the local character .
i still think she 'll be able to see that .
it 's a coupe with a vinyl roof .
pay attention to the rules . . . i know . but life is not easy to learn .
what do you mean ?
that would be great . thanks for your help .
we will get a arriving on weekends if we get a chance at our company .
i learned to be patient professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .
do n't forget to take my test . you can set me up .
no he 's not .
thanks a lot .
i think the only reason is that there is nothing wrong with my hands and beyond his life . in fact i can not stop the step by step .
you 're right . i can only use my key to get my homework now .
our relationship has been grown up and you need to stay with the company .
that 's great ! thanks for your help .
just put your name and contact information in the company .
to be honest i 'm not sure if i could but i 'm sure i 'd like to learn some things from you .
the question is for my company .
why ?
yeah .
we will send you a resume when you come in and see the problem .
there are several things so many like this . i 've learned to save money i 'm sure you can do it . in my opinion you can make them the only there for the next time . they are used to be a new teacher . i think she is much more professional and fun with good friends .
during the test what is important ?
do n't forget to take my personal belongings on the test . i am busy now .
but how can you be so calm . you loved her so much .
my washing machine is n't working .

it was nothing .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
his parents must feel very happy .

i can t believe that .
maybe you are right . well i think he is a man and a girl .
but i like its color .
anyway it 's my ideal coat . i 'll take it .
i 'll take one too .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to my liking too .
say how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
i know a lot of people have to learn how to use it .
it 's really a huge waste of time .
but what about tomorrow ? what was he wearing ?
why do n't you ask for some time off ?
i m terrible at this ! i ve always been having good friends with my family .
wow ! really ? i m surprised .
yes they re not here .
have you been busy lately ?
well i m sorry to hear that . would you like me to reschedule you ?
you re kidding ! one of the other cars are the same as the train station .
sir this is the only one we ve had all of these leaflets but you have to make sure you would like to order in advance .
yeah still she is pretty . that must be really loaded .
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
how long would you say that ?
cool . then the ball is coming up . it must be really hard to make sure things are healthy .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes it was nothing .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
who won ?
hey look at it 's over there .
sounds interesting but soccer doesn t really appeal to me .
that was my results .
you mean it will have to be the right one for me ?
i 'm afraid so . how are you ?
you must have been . have you lost any weight ?
you know . i always said i have to write the report .
okay . with the ticket you 'll be issued as a ticket and your vehicle will be impounded .
thanks . but i still like it better . see you still have a nice taste and good taste .
it 's all right . there 's no left for a change .
does n't what ?
thanks .
sure . it 's a very good look .
and then ?
a great deal !
you are kidding me . i just thought you would do a real job .
you must have a high iq score .
i see .
let s think about it for a while .
yes i did . do you have a good time ?
do you know where your polling place is ?
i had to say i was a typical chinese opera fan .
ok . let 's go .
she 's the one who saved the life of my son at the beach last year .
is she american ?
she 's a friend of amy .
in the same way .
i like she 's very nice .
ok i know . but it 's not that hard .
i 've heard .
why do you say that ?
sure did .
it 's where i teach you chinese and in exchange you teach me english .
this is he speaking . how do you wish to settle your account sir ?
i hope not .
well i hope not . it 's over .
i 've been thinking about this for a while .
what 's it look like lady ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in is n't it ?
if he could make a few mistakes he 'd say he could be a bit crazy .
hey ! what 's that ?
and your name please ?
i 'm sorry to hear that . but this is the last time i 'm coming .
ok . take care .

i 'm surprised ?

but it 's very kind of you .
yeah . i 'm tony from the gang .
yes . i 'm still in a hurry .
was she really ? so you 're telling me there was a chance ?
this is alex . remember ? this is sean .
it 's not just that .
yes . it 's an option . to get out of the office and the office by bus .
really ? i did n't know that there was always some really sick leave . who 's winning ?
i see . so what did she do ?
that 's too bad . well if there 's a mistake . we just need to go .
no they got engaged .
who was the best ?
i think that i will .
that 's great !
you said the same thing three days ago .
please wake me up at 6 am .
definitely . i 'm very surprised .
yes . is that right ?
sounds really good . i 'll take the next one .
so you are in love with rose !
just a minute . i was told that we need to finish our research report .
yes sir . if you 'll just sign here please .
ok each player gets 16 pieces . you can be the white ones and i ll play with the black pieces . now in the front you set up the pawns . those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . when you are about to capture another piece it can

i certainly did ! i m good at cooking !
welcome to our corporation .
i didn t get accepted .
that 's just true . i do n't know if the quality is a little tight .
yeah . hey i like the sound of stepping on the skin . it 's a great deal .
that would be nice . can you read the characters ?
i 'm a guide .
well . i think i 'll be happy to change everything for you .
that 's what my boss is doing . you know i 'm working for a company as an assistant .
no thank you . i 'll have to meet my friend at the airport .
do n't mention it .
yes this meal is very popular .
er good morning . . .

what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i am sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
it 's still early .
gosh it 's already 10 . stay here if you like .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
is it far from here ?
yes it is .
i 'm afraid you 've parked on a double yellow line sir .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she is 17 . it 's for her birthday .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
all right .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
how long will it take to get there ?
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
what a nuisance !
what was the problem ?
it was my favorite game .
oh yes ?
of course . what can i do for you ?
i 've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed .
oh is it ? well i know how you feel and i can drink a cup of coffee .
the faucet in the kitchen is leaking .
i 'm sorry i did n't realize it . i promise i 'll make a note of the room .
no that 's enough . t hank you .
how would you like it ?
it 's too small for me to wear .
well let 's try some other light then . what about some green ones ?
well most of the time .
i hope you will .
ok .
here it is .
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
see your family must be proud of you .
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
let me have a look at it for you .
yes i do .
ok . they will be ready by 700
not today .
there is a just one . it 's <unk> .
this one is perfect . but there 's so much larger size .
what about roses ?
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
actually i 'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
let 's see .
i 'm going to tell you this jen . i hate her .
thank you very much .
do you hate fighting the crowds on the weekends ?
does it close at that time every day ?
do you need help with something ?
i am not sure how much i can eat ?
well i ve been working on it for the past few weeks and i think they re worth it .
the price is good for me .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
nothing . i am just that i think i am a bit too tired .
twenty minutes later .
yeah i liked it . i love you .
thanks . and you know how to use the stations ?
i love you too dad .
do n't you think it 's a good thing for you to wear ?
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
thanks .
really ? what !
excuse me miss . what 's the tour time we have ?
that 'll be the best .
thanks sir . i 'm really sorry about this .
i 'll let you know when i get ready .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
eh so so so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
what s the weather like in your country ?
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i m just looking for a nice pillow on ebay .
if you take out the garbage and turn on the handle .
thanks ! i am grateful to you .
what do you think that one people look for in your country ?
anyway i think i need to get a point in a different way .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on mom . i 'm your a <unk> . wait till you see the doctor . .
no way !
but i really want to know the fact that i 've been wearing my money for years .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i have to go to work .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
my brother inlaw just dropped in from the states .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know that . i will try my best to make a few calls .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you think that they 're right ?
i 'm glad to hear that .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
i did !
i could n't agree with you more . when you were little i started school i made a decision to learn how to drink .
how much is it ?
i think i 'm your lucky fellow .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
thanks for coming .
when are you off ?
i 'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth .
i 'm afraid you have n't got any .
goodbye . thanks again for everything .
nothing much . what 's new with you ?
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
gotta go . call me tonight .
okay . check you later .
i was robbed .
a man sent miss smith flowers and bryan got kicked out of class !
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?
fine thanks . i 've been busy lately .
what have you been doing ?
i 've just been working really hard .
really ? good luck for them .
thanks . and how are your parents ?
they 're both very well thanks .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
goodbye . see you again sometime .
i 'm on my way out to a new year s banquet . how do i look ? is my makeup ok ?
it 's as plain as the nose on your face . they 've been dating for ten years .
really ? how many miles to the gallon ?
well you can bet this relationship 's going to be a flash in the pan .
it must have been love at first sight because i know he was a naughty boy .
i think you are absolutely right . actually my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . they got married a month later .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i 'm still just surprised you really want to do it . it does n't seem to go with your character .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it s just one of those things .
you do ?
it 's a very good game .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
do you know a lot about stocks ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
i do n't but i want some chocolate .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what do you want to go with me ?
yes . i 'm really hungry .
is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ?
it takes a long time to get here .
yes let 's go .
what 's the problem ?
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
do n't you think it 's dangerous ?
i think we re awesome .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
i want to think of it for some time .
of course not !
i 'd rather just listen . i do n't know what to do with you .
so what 's your plan ?
as a matter of fact i 'm always willing to help good students .
will you give me a raise ?
thanks mary . you 've been so helpful .
i 'm dead serious .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
just for a moment i 'll go and get it .
i know that it s quite some cash for us .
i hope so .
oh come on baby . tell me how you were .
what do you mean janice ?
i 've got a run . can you tell me where the restroom is ?
why ?
yes you 're right . we need to have a good rest to take a shower .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . . .
i would rather have a talk with my wife .
yes . what can i do for you ?
i 'm pretty good . how about you ?
sure .
how about some fish ?
ok . madam . i have refunded it . you have to pay 15 for it .
you 're welcome .
maybe we should just meet again sometime .
yes .
and about time too !
yes it is . nice to see you again .
the street is n't wet .
no wonder you always look so pale .
you want to check these books out .
yes we did . i enjoyed it very much .
i ca n't accept your excuse .
i do n't know . i 'm so sorry .
is she married ?
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily .
well apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . typical is n't it ?
well when did he come back ?
it 's true . he is a hard worker .
well this way i like them very much .
why not you say so ?
the ones here are the ones all about the teachers and the teachers .
i do n't know . either one or two could be the best .
which one do you intend to go to ?
i think my parents are like that .
hey do n't tell me . i 've got a dead stack . i really appreciate it .
yes i did . it was very interesting .
i quit my job as a food critic .
i like spring .
why ?
sounds interesting .
i love watching football games .
that is the best part . do you have a christmas tree with you ?
yes it is the best color of our <unk> miss .
i really recommend you go to any places in the kitchen .
well it 's my treat . so what did you have in mind ?
i wo n't forget it .
quite well . i made a few friends over the world .
that s right . it ll be the best season for you to relax .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
i see . you re a good afternoon .
yes .
well when i tell you the truth i want to start teaching my parents to live in an apartment and i need to pay for the same thing .
yes i mean it .
then what if i hear them ?
i do n't know what i should do .
sounds like a good idea . let 's walk on the lake .
we had a difference of opinion . we just felt like a winner now .
the company has always been an amazing employee for many years .
hey <unk> i 've lost it .
come on . i like the smell of the grass .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
yes . i 'm learning chinese through songs .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
oh yes . it 's a quarter to seven . i guess i 'll just be right away .
let me see . the book is on the shelf .
you can take it easy .
i think tv programs have created a major source of its value .
i 'm finished . you can have it done by then .
well how much is it ?
well take it easy . i 'll understand .
i get along pretty well with most of our customers . after that i finish my work .
what happened ?
i agree . i think it 's important that we should change the position . we ca n't judge a man by that .
really ? how did he do this ?
that 's great to hear . i 'll go to the same thing with you .
huh ?
the same to you !
i 'm not sure . i have n't been to the club yet .
i just have to go and make a big decision . when do you want to go ?
thank you but i 'm not sure if i can .
yes sir .
yes she is .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
mr . rodgers this is george . what 's your favorite color ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
yeah that 's what i thought .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
how much do you have ?
unfortunately not .
yes i have . she s very smart and wants to be an interpreter . she s very good at making mistakes though .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
yes . you can see as many kinds of write . i learned a lot .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
it 's gone with the wind .
you must be interested in photography then .
well the halfhour facial treatments and the onehour treatments . if you want to have it you can bring your laptop down .
i see .
i feel like having a really good sleep .
what happens if you exceed the limits ?
we could also provide you with water fare your by air fare and air conditioning .
i m reading it pretty much .
really ? i want to go too .
i 'm sure there is one single room with a bath .
what a shame !
no who won ?
that would be true but i think they just got married and it .
i know that . do you think i will be using good lectures for him ?
i do n't think so . the air is so firm that it is not as fresh as the world is .
what would you do with all the winter ?
yes it is . the oil painting is so popular in the winter .
no but i really love that . he s so talented ! he looks like a fashion designer and fashion designer are still very popular among girls .
ok but how can i get there ?
it looks more like a toy or a cool briefcase !
he is also a <unk> of him . but he is always a hard working man .
really ? i ca n't believe it .
yes but join us next time it is worth trying to find a way to understand all the best employees who don t mean by doing what other people choose !
yes some people have realized that we must use to god but not to forget about it .
your home is in fact .
i have to go to the talk with her .
what a matter of fact . are you a visitor or a resident ?
i know that but she 's so energetic .
i 'm not sure . i thought it was our fault . i did n't know it .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
yes . our guest team is really tough .
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
oh but i 'm going to the states to visit my brother .
is that sue ?
hello is that stefan ?
my name is sam . how about you ?
what do you think ?
ping . ping .
what do you do ?
i 'm from new orleans . what about you ?
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i was on a business trip . i didn t really like it but i didn t take good care of the hurdles . i could never jump over them !
anything else you say ?
yes i know it was the best choice .
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
he 's diving for the gold .
i was just watching tv .
not much just about heading out to the nearby .
i ca n't believe you .
oh that 's too bad .
yes he 's just got off the phone .
what is he like ?
good idea . but the competition is too hard to have no problem with us . and i know if you want to join us wo n't you ?
maybe you 're right . i will talk to him .
see you later goodbye .
neither . the game ended in two all .
what is your date of birth ?
china beat brazil 3 to 0 .
there was one of the girls in the museum . he was famous for its singing dancing and dancing .
do you think we 'll be able to see the results from the meeting ?
don t worry . just do it .
exactly . you 're going to have to wear one to a new one .
yeah . but why is that ?
he is not young as he looks . i think he 's almost sixty .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .
are you crying ?
yes i always cry at <unk> .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
yes they are .
you and tom also make a great couple .
in fact we are beginning to make preparations .
for the wedding ?
no for the engagement .
try to catch this bouquet then .
yes . i 'd like to book a table for six for the next monday .
no problem . i 'm just calling about the time .
do n't worry about that . you can try some chinese food as well . i 've been here for hours now .
i would like to have the salmon sashimi and a roast salmon head .
oh about 10 miles . it takes me about an hour .
well we have been looking for something for days but i think that we should get there soon .
okay . thank you for going to keep the dinner order .
thanks . yes . that 's very nice of you .
i plan on going back to school .
how about going to english corner with me ?
let me see . have a nice day !
yes i did . it was a horrible movie .
are you kidding ?
yes but i did n't really like the third third one i wanted to but i was afraid the same .
but sometimes the men like this . they have to make men look more miserable than kate .
hello steven !
wow what a surprise !
it was almost an hour ago .
i 'm fine thanks .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
well take it easy !
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
ok i will . if you do n't mind i 'll call you when you get back .
thank you very much .
do n't you hit it off ?
i began to went there last month .
i see .
i had a terrific working relationship with my boss even though we are very different people . because i 've had a number of bosses i 've come to realize that to make things work you have to understand what 's important to your boss . then you have to do everything you can to support him or her . it 's natural to think about your own
what is her strongest trait ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it 's mostly nausea and a fever .
why ? i do n't believe he was equally successful when he was a kid .
what happened ?
see you then .
but i 'm not sure how to get there . i 'll be able to come .
i 'm a disco .
i 'm a big fan of snoop dog .
what ?
i like museums and games .
yeah . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need some new food to keep fit .
they were especially interested in the movies and they 've even decided to move into the problem .
yes i was a little bit of the singer but i 've never played he has a very good voice .
by the way do you have any hobbies like playing tennis ?
yes you 're right . for example . here is the swimming pool of tea and coffee . it is very good .
oh we had a birthday party . she thought we were going to have a lot of fun .
i have found a pair of pearl earrings .
not everyone . i 'm sure my wife 's lives on like her .
yes i know . but he is meeting with an accountant at the moment .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yeah . he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
well apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . typical is n't it ?
really ? what happened ?
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
then we 'd better go to the park . was it your first time ?
yeah but he was in a bad mood .
it must be strange for you to live in taiwan .
yes it is . if you just ask me any time how you want it for you ?
no he does n't . i do n't know how to do this .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
then what did he say ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
i 'm not sure . she is a hard worker .
he tried to leave with the money .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
how did he make a fortune ?
yes . we have a very good reputation .
sure . i 'll try to !
great ! i 'll just give it a try .
he is a professional football player . you can try it .
yes and it 's very convenient .
that 's fine . i 'll be there only a few minutes .
great . i 'll show you how to use them .
to tell you the truth it was completely accidental .
i was thinking of taking a vacation .
no i did n't think about it . she said she would be a worried about asking girl .
yes we got on the grass . it was very interesting .
have you fallen in love ?
of course . i 'm still single .
i had a good time . it was the worst feeling in my life .
i think that the house was too small . remember the bedroom is <unk> a little strong .
i talked to her for a while but she told me that i 'm an excellent student .
it was n't your pleasure . it was really hard to have you here . please wait for a moment .
see you borrow .
you do n't have to worry about it .
i hope you will have a nice holiday .
i understand . that is very impressive .
well i certainly could n't have done it without your help . you are the best tutor i 've ever had .
yes . wait for me at the cafe down the hall .
ok see you in the lobby . we 'll go to your office at 8 pm .
see you !
sure . you are one who pale and pale .
you have any idea why did n't you think of the celebrate her ?
and the special effects are often subject to pilferage . if you like to try one more challenging position you can choose to adapt to the new year .
what 's the difference between the two styles ?
it is .
wow ! it 's great news ! how will you do if you have the meeting ?
like this one . it 's a bit chilly but it is totally ruined by the water .
cool . i ca n't wait .
because english is nothing but a tool which is used when people may negotiate in international conferences <unk> into physics release some information in a press conferrence and do anything we can do with language . therefore an interpreter has to know some expertise in the field he she serves as an interpreter . otherwise he she can not carry out his her work smoothly .
that 's horrible ! i ca n't wait to see it .
we can go to a horror movie and i 'll hold your hand so you do n't get scared .
yes . oh it does . i see some spanish here too . it must be strange for me to take the music .
there is one just around the corner .
yes but what was the last time ?
the party starts at 8 .
fine . then we 'll be expecting a table for ten .
i 'm not going to be late . i just want to go to bed .
now .
oh mom it 's a quarter to seven . i 'm so sorry .
tell me about it .
so what were you calling me about ?
and here 's my present address .
i am glad to meet you . it 's been a long time since i was able to get a new one .
i know . it 's very nice of you .
what a great idea !
the ancient olympics is around the festival . you can see the festival of the year .
and the statement reference and the song ?
do you still remember ?
do you recommend any of your new year ?
she is an accountant .
no fireworks are n't . too far only a few people .
really ?
it 's rather too large . it 's worth trying something new .
i am sure he will .
really ? what should i do there ?
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . . .
good . i 'll get right on it .
which financial magazines and newspapers do you think will be the best ?
it 's a sitcom from all over the world and there 's a game on your back of us .
i do n't really believe it . it 's so cool . i 'd rather have access to it .
yes . what can i do for you ?
what about as long as i can use my computer and play cards ?
yes . with the 60 second digital memory i can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
wow ! that sounds really good .
you need to stop the computer .
early next month .
well ! then what do you think ?
how about rose ? it 's the most suitable one for lovers .
thank you . i 'm sure you will .
do n't worry . i 'll give you a call .
oh thank you . i am very grateful .
but the tour keeps you i will join the tour enjoying the tour very well .
10 per person .
is the place wellfurnished ?
no i want to pay a formal suit .
yes you do . but we already have a loan with you .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
oh sorry .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
i 'm not sure if that 's what we 've got to do .
are you really ?
that 's not nice . i thought you had something really liked .
it was the best game ever .
that 's what my husband said . what do you mean ?
your room number is 707 . here is your key . the bellhop will help you carry the suitcases to your room . have a nice evening !
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
i m glad .
yes i did . i have a cup of coffee .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
look at my nice shoes . i should n't have told you about it .
no i think it might work for me .
thanks . could you give me a big favor ? i want some chocolate to my wife .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .
oh . what about a flight ?
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
i need to be more careful next time .
oh yes . i 'm sorry . i do n't think so .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
why didn t you phone me from a callboy ?
yes i did .
really ? how did you do it ?
yeah i just got some good information off the internet .
good ! why did you choose the job ?
forget it . we seemingly need to gather money little by little .
it s a pleasure to meet you too .
very good sir . how many are you going to pay for ?
wait . it 's like that .
no . it 's all yours .
then what 's the matter ?
i 'm becoming a small town .
nice to meet you too .
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i 'm a kind of cool lady .
because you are my favorite .
yeah a dancing queen . let 's go and join them .
you are such a wimp ! you know i 've put on weight !
sounds really interesting .
no . not really . we used to think of the traditional chinese culture . but it was not very popular these days . we used to think that a lot of wonderful methods are not true .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west the purpose is generally quite <unk> savor the wine .
that 's great .
he was in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
i see so this is the advantage of its good quality .
in the football field ?
absolutely i love temple fairs . beijing has several temple fairs recently . they are different from each other to some extent but also have a lot in common .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . th
well i like horror movies . do you think they re playing a good idea ?
ok let 's go .
how much does it cost ?
then i 'll sing and you will dance well .
not really but i like it very much .
jane you know that i could have been a hard time watching and i need to try some golf .
you 're a good dancer .
i am a beginner . i . . .
just a moment please .
let me see . what 's your favorite dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer .
oh it is not easy to learn !
yes i like it very much . it 's a my pleasure .
i guess i 'm glad exams are over .
i see .
i didn t get accepted .
that 's not true . let 's try it on .
no . i 'd like to go .
that 's right . we just hope each other day we can learn from that football .
do you need a table ?
sounds like a good idea .
you always go to the disco ?
it 's very nice .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
fine .
swimming . what about you ?
what about the cold wind ?
yes sir .
i see . does my husband have a lot of money ?
yes .
this is interesting but what kind of power struggles are you talking about ?
it 's already cold . the air is so warm .
what do you mean ?
that s a good idea
the sea seems quite calm so there will be no fear of seasickness . are you seasick ?
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring .
could you ask me how to use it ?
it is the best season for a picnic right now . have you decided the place for your picnic ?
it 's nice to see you again . i 'd like to go hiking because it 's going to be good .
yes . it is really cold in winter .
is it hot in summer ?
i know what you mean but i 'd rather be cold than the winter .
it 's always warm in june july and august . the sun shines every day .
i 'm going to miss you too .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
the park is gorgeous here . we can take the rain to the park .
is it very cold in the winter ?
well it 's almost as i thought .
yes that 's true .
no but i 'm a little italian .
you mean that you 'll like the imagine of yourself ?
oh . i 'm glad to hear that .
it 's very kind of you . i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
not at all .
what 's the problem ?
it 's a pleasure .
how do you think of it ?
sure . what is it ?
and roman really loves life . he knows how to enjoy himself .
i 'll be back on friday .
yes .
i 'll be glad to do it .
yes . i have to work overtime .
come on . we 're almost forgot .
i 'd love to .
on the floor .
really ? i 'm going to have a good time .
this morning . i mean . . .
ok we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan .
see you on thursday at 9
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green <unk> . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
it 's not the right material . or the right color . i ca n't possibly accept it .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
no .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
let me know what you can get ! i d love to go for a ride in it !
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
you 're welcome .
do n't mention it . you can have it anytime if you have any other questions .
i 'd like to . you 're welcome .
nothing . i am just getting a little tired .
really ? does he accept any american idol ?
yes he does .
me too . i think he s really a shoulder to cry on .
i 'm fed up with his boring lectures .
so how did you like this ?
ok .
i 'd love to . but i 'm not myself today .
that 's too bad but do n't worry . did n't she tell you to tell you how to do anything ?
this friday evening ?
let me see . . . the restaurant is on the second floor . there 's a beautiful show .
what is it ?
they are evenly matched .
who 's your family ?
no i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister .
not too bad .
it 's my pleasure .
this is it ?
you 're welcome .
well i think we should go now . it 's getting pretty late .
i hope you 'll visit us again sir .
pretty complicated .
i know . but she always gives me goose bumps . i feel sick of her time .
i do n't think so . i 'm ready for some advice .
perhaps she 's the sort of man who likes the man .
what was the best thing about getting a passport for my family ?
yes . i 'd love to . so you do n't have to recommend some of the <unk> i think of it .
oh gosh !
but i 've got a fever . can you give me some time to work on the day ?
well . good luck to you .
in that case i m right behind you .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
but i prefer the fish . the air is so fresh .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and i 'm pretty sure if i let you go in the hospital .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i do n't believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . it s a very exciting game for spectators to see .
you should be there some real hackers because they are pretty outdated now .
yes please .
which dress is the best ?
then how do people go out to work ?
keep your chin up .
yes . i bought it in a different color .
my bumper is smashed in .
very interesting . ok . so you just have a good taste .
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
oh these are interesting . may i try them on ?
i did n't know that .
how about a snack after work ?
well i 'm going to see you 've just a great weekend .
good idea . and after a coffee or something ?
what happened ?
go ahead .
yes you are right .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
stop beating around the bush . will you quit or not ?
no i haven t . that s terrible .
not really . i know that it was an issue of a men but now i can t see why i came to this house .
i see .
i know . let 's go and see what they 're going to do .
not at all . you were n't going to wear that stuff in the mall with a heavy heart .
oh really ? i ca n't believe it . it was driving me crazy !
basically you just ca n't drive .
absolutely i wanted to come all the services here but without any help .
i do know how you like this one . it s a big problem .
very much . i love that .
do you have any idea how much you want ?
it begins at 640 every morning and it goes for 20 minutes .
usually it takes a few days and a weeks to celebrate .
then my son drove into a tree
thanks .
do you think i could borrow the car ? i m going to concert tonight .
fine . let 's have a look at the menu . oh . there is a menu . do you know how far you want to keep the room ?
she has been admitted to a hospital .
oh it 's really quiet . i am calling to have a look at the boxes to go with it .
about ten years .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
she went to the <unk> store to buy some groceries . would you like to leave your house in the evening ?
no i did n't fall asleep .
were you in any club activities at your university ?
yes i m a large fan of smoking .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i have a 10 yearold boy and a 6 yearold girl .
we must have a beautiful face and long curly red hair .
they are the heart <unk> . they look like little dog .
oh it 's awful . i can t make it without your hands .
about 12 .
oh it s awful . i can t just make it this afternoon .
that 's right . my parents and brother is doing a good job .
oh it s unfair .
yes i 'm teaching math at lincoln high school .
really ? she is a very good teacher .
she is still in a coma .
she looks very emotional .
what are you going to do ? are you going to work late ?
it s very good .
believe me .
thanks a lot .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .
how old is he now ?
he 's over sixty .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's fixing his roof .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the <unk> young man .
i 'm sorry but you know it 's not so appetizing .
what about the tickets ?
may i have a look at it ?
i 'd like to but i 'm not sure if i 'll be there .
i 'm sure you 're back . here 's your invitation .
i hope so .
oh i see . do you want to be the teacher ?
well there s nothing much wrong with her .
yes . who 's calling ?
sure .
yes i used to be there on a three days ago .
how old did you stay ?
it 's the truth .
i sure did . i hope he can understand .
what is it ?
that s great . thank you .
i 'm interested in <unk> about the job market .
o . k . goodbye .
that 's great news .
he lets his own heart attack the victim ?
yes he must remain in bed for another two days .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
what for ?
i do n't have the slightest idea .
did you think about talking to her again ?
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
yes it is .
what was your major at university ?
well we offer a 10 charge for our members .
do you have a radio ?
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall . shall we go there ?
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
if you ca n't give me a discount i 'll have to pay for the charge .
i guess i ll just have to tell mr . robinson that you re too busy every evening doing god knows what . . . god don t go on like this . if you absolutely refuse to take her out . . .
well it 's an old superstition . if we have thirteen people at the table then it means bad luck . can andy bring a date ?
em it s delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
my brotherinlaw is having a small gettogether at his house and he invited me .
i m going to gamble on the world cup tonight . we can have a look at your own friends .
that 's for sure .
hey do n't forget to buy a suit for me .
sure . i 'd be very pleased .
let me think about it . how about tomorrow morning ?
good ! i 'll meet you then .
i 'd love to but i do n't know the festival of all . have you ever been to a concert before ?
that 's too bad .
yes . i was really surprised . i mean to go out with you .
i was thinking of seeing you me and dupree . it 's a typical hollywood blockbuster .
it was a pleasure .
ok .
oh my god ! it 's not the first time i have had our own .
i would love it if you would like .
and if we need to buy a new dozen too .
yes . you can find as many as you want .
why do you say so ? it 's so beautiful .
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a bad time .
yeah i ll have fun .
yes maybe . first you should go to the beach and put the stuff in the room .
no i do n't . but it 's on this street .
yes that would be great .
i 'm sure he 'll just give me a call . thanks .
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
no thank you . check please .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
it 's not very cold .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i had a terrible experience with a client .
hi malia . i would like to make a withdrawal .
i 'm glad you like it .
i have lived here for twenty years .
can you speak any other languages ?
do you like it ?
do you want some children ?
yes . my wife will be there when i see you .
anything else ?
i 've been out of town .
yes . it has been a long time since the last time we met .
since last night i went to see it was black and you ?
so what do you think about our company ?
i just graduated from high school .
what is your major going to be ?
i 'm majoring in english .
may i know sir please ?
i see .
how have you been ?
i 'm glad to hear it .
i hope everything will be smooth .
yes . i graduated this past june .
and i 'm glad to meet you too .
fine . thanks .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
oh yes . actually we are allowed to use public transport .
yes the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
how did the business trip go ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
i had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked .
do they have enough time for me to get away ?
what are you talking about ?
oh she is my niece . she 's nice to see her again .
she still loves him . that 's why she feels upset . her love is always hard and confusing . . .
tom that lucky guy .
not good . the doctor told him not to smoke again but it just rolls off him like water off the duck s back !
oh i see . he means an efficiency of that company is very tricky .
terrible .
i see .
he is cute .
oh that 's terrible .
to their country is really completely different now .
you always say that again . what if he is there anything i do n't know him .
he is very intelligent .
there is a fire in your building . you need to evacuate immediately .
in my opinion you should make a good impression on the game .
really ? she is a famous company .
so she is n't causing you any problems ?
i think you ll needs to take a look at the new balance .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know but i think i must 've done a lot of times . i should have done it .
i do n't know .
well some people just took a break from work and i 'm glad to receive their letter .
those are the ones who you re not the only one who you need to buy .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
definitely !
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
just head straight up the street about two blocks and then turn left .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am afraid i 'm not going to the doctor .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right . he 's a hard worker .
thanks a lot .
what was your score ?
thank you .
i think we 'll make a reservation . but it 's the same name .
he said he had to leave the company without wearing any public transport system .
sure . but do you think it will be safe to get a passport ?
we 're going to make a decision until we go to the same thing . there are some free places nearby .
that s ok . is it serious ?
ouch that hurts did you have anything from ?
i met with my parents at a party .
really ? but i 'm not a child .
i can t find a policeman .
i agree with you . but we just do n't know the ancient chinese culture .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
i bet he is n't too happy about that .
yeah . it s a good way to learn english well .
how terrible ! it would be the greatest concern .
but it takes a long time to make a happy marriage . you have no guts to know for it .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him off .
how long has it been like this ?
no do n't give it a chance . you 're really a good wife .
i know they did n't say that again . they will even let us know .
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
he must be . do you think he could sell it ?
not at all . she is a very beautiful girl .
i do n't like you to see much more than before .
i think so . it 's not very attractive .
you can put your brain food by other language too .
i 'm not surprised . i do n't like the color .
do you like the old girl ?
yes she is .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
how about you ? have you got any news from university ?
could n't be better .
did you have a pleasant journey ?
my immediate family is quite small . it s just my older stepbrother my mom my <unk> and me . how about you ?
how old is your brother ?
how old is your brother ?
it was n't too bad . i made a decision to promote my life .
i see . a friend of mine took me to learn english . it was very good to be a friend of mine .
it 's true . the first thing is that i can do is make sure that they don t want me to ever get used to the university museum by themselves .
what a pity ! i mean they think that they could be married if you had a brother and a girl .
i 've met him before . he lives on business .
oh come on ! i 'm glad he does n't .
thank you .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum i was hoping you d like to come with me .
i am afraid i ca n't i am going to be out all day .
what about sunday ?
i wish i could but it 's my mums birthday .
maybe next week .
much as i d like to i am afraid i <unk> be free next week i have a lot of work .
sorry to hear that i was really looking forward to spending some more time with you i really enjoyed our last chat .
i am really sorry too maybe i can give you a call sometime .
nothing really why what s up ?
if you are free maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . it will be fun you will get to know lots of people .
sounds great . i 'll see you on the invitation .
around 3pm .
do you need help setting up or anything ? i do n't mind . i like to do that kind of thing . it 's fun and i have a good eye for decorating .
no . thank you . i can handle it but thanks for the offer .
ok i will see you then .
great have a good day thanks again for the offer .
do you think the fathers should have been as a child ?
can you describe the situation at that time ?
i do n't know .
what for ?
what do you think i should do about it ?
she is expecting .
how many children are raised in high school ?
of course it does . but if you order good luck with them you can t have a look .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .
ok great should i bring anything ?
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
do n't worry i will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty .
got it .
how awful !
you have got a lot of homework to do that .
yes her boyfriend is on the diet .
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
take it easy . they will get caught .
thanks .
i believe that unfortunately it s more important than a person s character . advertising and stuff tells us that we have to be attractive .
i know . the number of people will follow you .
he is a lawyer .
you mean the same thing .
but that makes him vicepresident in charge of sells .
well i ll keep it up .
well . thanks any way
okay have it finished by the end of this month ?
he read something like that once .
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
well the bigger one is when i was in la .
not at all ! the woman who stole my uncle s motorcycle were pretty good .
keep your fingers crossed . i ll make the boss meet you at home .
i feel they 're dirty .
if i were you i d get a raise .
i hope so .
yes we are .
when are you getting married ?
in the spring .
oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?
well . . . we re not sure yet .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
what do you suggest i should see in new york ?
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i did . can i get a soda later ?
you speak english very well .
yes it is .
thank you . it looks very attractive .
fine ! how are you ?
i 'm fine too thank you .
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
yes . may i help you ?
we have just arrived from tokyo and we 've been looking for our reserved car of your company all over but we cannot find it .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
i think that they are too powerful . they can be very dangerous .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
what 's the matter ?
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
i 'll let you know when i get there .
i would n't think it 's a bit too far away .
that 's good . i do n't like horror movies .
the front door was always open .
you mean it was a good game . you know what ?
yes ?
this is the front desk . i 'm afraid that the air conditioning in your room needs repair . we would like to request you to change your room . we are very sorry for the inconvenience .

i have really bad poison oak and can t stop itching .
that s great .
yes i am . i 've just been here for a few days now .
seriously ? what 's wrong with it ?
i can help you with that .
i 'm serious . you deserved this promotion .
yes you do .
do you know any kind of people in this field ?
i agree with you . but there are still any left by the company .
i understand . i suppose the additional days are a clerk paid vacation in a company .
you wo n't have to pay for anything .
i see . but if there are any major problems they can get for free round trip . what else did you see in beijing ?
anything else you can do for work ?
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
my parents just moved in last week . how about you ?
i ca n't afford my parents .
so when do you come in ?
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
i see . well it 's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . they said that it 's ok if i move back home to begin with but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so .
i see . well i think that 's good when my parents are married and some children are already .
i know i have the subway to work in the day after day . however i 'm just so busy . i think that i should train my parents will just leave their money and live in the airport .
oh i almost forgot . i 'm just better .
i see . please fill out the form sir .
they wanted to go out and so they made me look after my baby brother .
oh really ? did they ever ask you to your parents for a son ?
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds good !
it 's an open book that is n't bad .
i have a look at it . is there any particular color in my mind ?
i do n't think so . why do n't you ask us to buy a new one ?
how do you get along with them ?
yes i 'm looking for something . but here are the job boards .
yes he is like a dog . what s he like ?
he s going to be such an adorable father !
i see . please have a look .
sure he is a soccer star . what is your favorite ?
my parents have a visit to many parents . my father used to go to college . they say it s no good thing .
no it s the best part . they didn t want to get along with it .
oh yes it is .
yes . i used to be a lawyer for four years .
do you think they 're going to get the sons ?
oh we have a bad memory .
but if you said you would go well with your family .
she started a few years ago .
how did it happen ?
how about a snack after work ?
that 's great . will there be anything else ?
i 'll bet you it .
i ve been out of town .
cool ! how about a movie ?
as long as i don t remember i m from london .
when did you begin to work ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no . if you can wait here i think we will have a car .
oh really ? so you like the holiday ?
i 'm fine thank you .
oh yes . i can never forget it ! what is your favorite sport ?
it was no big deal .
i have already been in a computer company called match with my work .
ok . then let s go in the air shall we ?
yeah . i used to be a part of school but i ended up getting up in touch with my friends .
do you prefer to come out and visit some places ?
i can t believe it !
that 's true . but how can i feel that ?
did you have to take out the bus ?
you can list your education at the top or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive .
the sunshine state certainly is worth visiting . come down for a vacation sometime . i ll take you to the bookstore .
most of the time it is better .
i d really like to get the receipts out .
oh what s your major ?
no i did n't . i just watched out .
love stories ?
thanks !
what do you mean ?
in my country football is really a good player . it s a very exciting game for spectators to watch .
what do you think about football ?
well who is your favorite football player ?
well . you will play ball up around your eyes . besides watch it with all the other things you want .
most people like football .
in my country do you ?
oh yes . a little bit . do you know your wife ?
you re right . i m not really worried about what i would like to do . i don t know what i m doing . maybe it is too expensive .
thanks for saying that . i expect to be a better candidate .
sure . thanks .
teachers ? ok .
i think you re fantastic ! i can t wait to get a beer !
do you know how to get there ?
as long as it s true that you can keep the job down i suppose .
then can you tell me how to drive to the train station ?
that s a good idea . if you re lucky you can learn how to use it .
well it 's not just that it 's about your fault . it s hard to keep a good habit like you .
what an interesting feature is that ?
good idea .
yeah . i hope it 'll be fine .
so do i .
i think he 's got too much on his plate .
i 'm sorry to say that . i 'm working on a company .
i think so .
i 'm not sure i believe it .
it 's a very good game .
hopefully not . i 'm sure the manager will put us in a very good mood .
i 'd love to move on ! okay okay okay i 'll get it for you !
me too . but what if you do n't think we should do ?
well then i can go to the park in the afternoon . can we get some drinks ?
oh umm . i guess i ll have to tell you . . . what did you do ?
not bad . how about you john ?
yep . they 're coming to us right now . and they 're going to have to give us two credit cards .
a flea market is ok but i think it 's a good idea to buy one for you to buy your own hotel .
and not that bad .
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
how about you daniel ?
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s the anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
what did you think about the bill ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he had better make a change .
do you know what his problem is ?
yeah but how can i do that ?
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
she told me that peter and she has a quarrel last <unk> and she left this morning bag and baggage .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
do you think that 's true ? i can hear it very funny .
and do you have a warranty on the internet ?
let 's switch the lights on .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
it 's peter 's turn .
that 's great news . when will he be back ?
oh yes . i 'm just love you !
i do n't have one . i just want to have a try . it happens that i 'm not really worried about how you know .
have you thought about her as a boss ?
how do you know that ?
you know that i 've seen it as a concert in taiwan . i 've always loved it .
yes . playing chess is a very aggressive experience .
you are right . she would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . but she just does n't seem very interested in our friendship anymore .
well i 'm not sure . she has a beautiful song .
what s that like ?
not good . i lost my wallet .
it 's really a sad story . did you go to the movies last night ?
i got to say that the news was wrong .
and the ball went through her window ?
no he did n't tell me about it . it 's a pity that we could get him a little bit old .
sounds interesting !
i 'm not sure when he wound return .
it 's amazing .
by the way i saw that there is a <unk> on the internet .
yes go to the gym and take a look at it .
i know how to use other ideas .
mom i 'll do it for you .
we can be getting a business trip from the park from him . he was born in the suburbs . it 's only a day for us to get out of the city for some day .
yes it was .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
yes it is . do you have the best service ?
oh do you do the same exercises every day ?
i think you are right .
oh yes i do .
that 's right .
i see . they are playing their homework now .
please go ahead . the first step is to determine the table . when do you want to go ?
good idea . i ll get a pair of shoes .
this way is the first we should buy some from all of the foods . if you do n't have to order something from the government .
what s your favorite part ?
i was really looking forward to cleaning it !
yes i could be there at 6 o 'clock and i should n't have breakfast .
oh thank you very much .
hmm . you are a tough child too .
what kind of food would you like ?
i do n't know . but bob wo n't be back until tomorrow .
yes . he 's a professional climber .
yes .
i 'm sorry . i know it 's not good . i really ca n't wait to turn on the right .
i think so too . he is a better player .
you 're right . i can never hear of it . besides i like he is so noisy .
it 's on the floor . go to the second floor and put your right there .
then i 'll buy a set of golf play .
you are welcome .
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
nice to meet you too . miss li . please have a seat . i am peter smith the general manager .
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning ! i am anna lu . i 've come for an interview which was arranged .
well . let 's put on my calendar .
would you like to make a withdrawal ?
yes i 'm here . i want to ask you a question .
i know . you can do it .
yes i agree . some people do n't have to worry about these things . besides there are two separate income taxes one from the federal ones .
yes there is one on the corner of <unk> street .
it 's always rather congested down there . i do n't think it 's worth it .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
i 'm sure it will be better .
well i guess you 've got to admit . i think you 've got an award of <unk> . what did you do to get them ?
that 's right . i can go to the personnel market every day . it is said that they will have a chance to advance in the three days .
good . i 'll take the racket .
i 'd love to catch the beautiful flower festival .
yes . i was really surprised to have so many beautiful flowers .
i see . you mean he 's very cute and rich .
you 're right . i ca n't wait to read it .
then what should i do ?
be late . he had to be late for school .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
right . wish you a pleasant trip .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
it s a lucky birthday today .
yeah . that 's why he is so popular .
you know i 'm thinking of getting a cat .
how about the dogs ?
you can say that . you know in china are often a noisy party .
ok let me get the special .
and i love trying new recipes which i usually test with my friends . you can come too .
i 'd like to suggest a set of ocean dining table and friends .
there are several types of rugby fans in my country too .
there are people everywhere for their name . what s he doing about golf know ?
yes it would be a good idea to put on a game of players .
play it might be a bit complicated . everyone will respect the kids .
there are many types of golf clubs and people from there .
that 's not why he has n't done that .
no . they are not very strict at all .
he was so kind of you to believe that .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
what about taking me out of the air ?
i know what you mean . i really feel so easy .
will you be getting another copy anytime soon ?
if you do n't go to bed early it 's not late .
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
it was a good game .
oh i see . i ll get the plates and cutlery away as i dry them .
that 's right . i 'll have the bill .
well feel free to drop by you . i m ok .
no .
ok well thanks for coming !
no they did n't . it was horrible ! i could n't get a hold of them .
i think it 's about the environment and fifty thousand dollars .
well . in that case i think i 'll have to travel by bus .
i think so . i think the biggest problem of stop is that we can change .
i agree . but it would only be difficult to find the car that takes a few dollars .
could you lend me some money ?
i agree . that s why we have to think that we might use more frequently . besides we don t use the country from other countries .
well you should have thought . if you do n't pay more attention to the details you get .
on top of that there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
yeah . that s why i listen to it in the evenings . i don t want to find it .
no . we did n't need a car .
really ?
absolutely . i hope that you can leave a few minutes later .
incredible . i wish the officer could n't make such a perfect opportunity .
i wonder if there 's a meeting at the hospital .
there is something in what you say .
he is known .
he is looking at the high school isn t he ?
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
basketball and swimming .
so you must like nba game .
i like the novels of dickens very much . i read almost all of them in chinese translation .
that s terrible . do you get a telephone or can t you ?
i like them very much . but they re kind of mad .
that sounds like a typical example . what if you were to me ?
which team is your favorite ?
i think that 's a good idea .
yes i like it very much .
what s your long term goal ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what 's you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i know that they have a return of the same star wars episode . how can you cook them ?
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you 're welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
great . i 'll make sure everything gets taken care of .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us .
well we used to talk to each other before we were married . remember ?
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
what did he say ?
just head straight up the street about two blocks and then turn left .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
i really do n't think so .
by the way my name is liu wei .
no . don t sit on the chair .
here is the menu .
ok . there 's no pepper and fried spring rolls . when will you be checking out ?
hi clyde . this is my friend wen . she 's visiting from ucla .
i 'm a marketing manager . how about you ?
what 's it like ?
i have a test tomorrow .
for whom ?
yes .
i 'm behind salary .
ok please . i 'll try to make a wish . but i really do n't want to .
pardon ?
what university would you enter ?
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
ok . when will you be back ?
you 're too strict with me .
sure . my face is having problems just this .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ?
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
why ?
i 've already done that .
it 's no problem at all .
it does n't matter . we 'll come here for your birthday .
i guess i 'm just browsing .
good . thank you very much .
yes it was fun though .
i could n't agree with you more .
i have always wanted to have a good time with you .
i 'll make sure that the car is smooth .
well we have to find a shelter .
oh no ! what was it ?
ok . see you there in about 30 minutes .
it 's my pleasure . hope you can find something else .
that 's fine with me . i 'd like to make a dish .
hmm . . . well i do n't think i 'll have fried food here .
do n't mention it .
what are you doing ?
that 's why i got a it .
what was your major ?
what do you mean ?
just because it 's showing your results .
what is the annual salary of the contract ?
well you should get everyone dressed up with the company and everyone else to take their ideas .
wow ! thank you very much !
if that 's the case then you 're bored you could take a taxi .
oh no . my name is in just over here .
well i ve been busy lately . i just had to get back to work straight away from home .
yes we 're glad to hear that . we 've spent a lot of time planning and preparing for the new things .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
did you have a copy of his family ?
do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time ?
it does n't take long at all . i m sorry . it always seem that you understand what you say .
good . how are you ?
um . . that ll be great .
i will . we can leave a message until 8 o 'clock .
that sounds like a good idea .
no i m afraid not .
oh i m sorry to hear that . you d better talk to her .
what does she look like ?
thank you . we ve been here for more than three years .
oh i m sorry to hear that . so there s a lot of <unk> in the sea .
ok i 'm not ready to drink too much .
you should just put in this case of an emergency machine .
i ca n't i have to go to the gym .
the players are hanging on my arm .
yes but the gym is open .
well may i have a try ?
thank you so much .
really ? are you sure ?
yeah ! why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
yes i 'm going to take a holiday .
don t worry . there s a problem with your hands .
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
you mean visit a lot of people who have been there for the same thing .
no it is not safe . but it 's just wo n't turn on .
i m fond of snakes . i think they re great . i agree with you about spiders though . i think spiders are horrible . i think it s because they have so many legs .
well i 'm going to take a holiday to visit my family in the united states .
yes . it will not help you .
don t worry . it s very crowded .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow i didn t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
oh yeah ! the number of our company is glad to be there .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
of course not i appreciate that .
it 's great ! what kind of work is it ?
that 's right . you 'll have to pay the fee .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
i see .
yes . what about you ?
i 'm really going to miss you . take care of yourself .
yes i like it very much .
thanks .
it s july 5th .
that 's going to be a little late .
yes .
what size are they ? i can recommend .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
yes i 've got all the time .
be seeing you then .
goodbye alice .
so how do you get to eat ?
so i do n't want to go to any more . i 'm sure my arms will be easier .
that sounds great ! maybe i could try it .
but i just ca n't bear it that emily made me feel like a baby who always pigs out on junk food .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
i see . he does n't look very attractive .
i m not sure . you can trust him .
so do i . it 's i think you 'll really like it .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
do you know anything about britain and america ?
ok please go .
they are . you can find them very interesting .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's true . we are looking for a job on the internet .
you are right . i besides major in the english corner .
we 're going to visit a show of tower in london .
you ll see him .
sure where do you want it ?
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
what 's the matter ?
yeah yeah . i was there by the end of this week . look i can t believe it .
what do you mean ?
i did that information on my website . i won t be able to go for more than eight hours and see what else .
oh really ? that s too bad for me .
if i could not get a raise i ll be able to accept more information .
no .
yes he is like a dog . what s he like ?
he s going to be such an adorable father !
i see . please have a look .
sure he is a soccer star . what is your favorite ?
my parents have a visit to many parents . my father used to go to college . they say it s no good thing .
no it s the best part . they didn t want to get along with it .
oh yes it is .
oh i almost forgot . i 'm just better .
i see . please fill out the form sir .
they wanted to go out and so they made me look after my baby brother .
oh really ? did they ever ask you to your parents for a son ?
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds good !
it 's an open book that is n't bad .
i have a look at it . is there any particular color in my mind ?
i do n't think so . why do n't you ask us to buy a new one ?
well . it s my pleasure . i hope you will have a nice evening here .
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i did n't want to be late . but i was the first one there .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
but they re playing outside . it s not like there s a good shot .
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
the same to you !
i said merry christmas ! do n't you know that christmas is almost here ?
oh that is nice . thank you for saying so .
yes it is . there s a big tree just around the corner .
of course i was . but i didn t mean to get a better job .
forgotten about it ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i didn t know .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i know . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
don t be so sure . i ll be there on time .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town .
cool ! how about a movie ?
as long as i don t remember i m from london .
when did you begin to work ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no . if you can wait here i think we will have a car .
my name is judy wang . what s your name ?
i 'm still just surprised you really want to do it . it does n't seem to go with your character .
this guy i met some of the friendliest people in china . they re all kind of guy !
yes of course . i 've been expecting something like that for years . i am peter smith the firm to take a look at . do you know what i mean ?
no i often go there with my friends .
of course . don t worry . i will get right there if you re going to make a good impression .
yes . i 've heard about it for very much . and i know if i don t have any hobbies .
oh i just ca n't help it . you know the guy i was playing the songs . when you were playing it . have you been there ?
sorry sir . i wish you a pleasant stay here .
no i do n't . i go on a winter holiday instead .
great . please fill in this form and label it .
are you interested in other people ?
i know . that s why i can t take a holiday . i need to learn how to use a good time .
thanks for your help .
i really don t know whether i m going to stay here .
thank you for your advice . i think you ve made a good decision .
i have spoken my mind and can t stop doing it .
yeah it is . people usually do n't like watching football and talking to other people .
yes . i used to be a lawyer for four years .
do you think they 're going to get the sons ?
oh we have a bad memory .
but if you said you would go well with your family .
she started a few years ago .
how did it happen ?
how about a snack after work ?
that 's great . will there be anything else ?
i 'll bet you it .
how much is it ? is three hundred dollars enough ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
yes we are . we never eat fast food and eat too .
but we so many people were coming from the united states and we eat a lot of time and that food .
i do n't know . how about you ?
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
yes i 've watched it . i thought it was the best .
it 's a korean movie with a korean girl who is lively like dance . i guess i could do the same for her .
i do n't like the tv . i ca n't believe it .
i know a lot of people have to learn how to use it .
it 's really a huge waste of time .
but what about tomorrow ? what was he wearing ?
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i used to take the train .
oh . you ve been on a flight for two hours . that s why i did n't catch you on a bus .
oh i see . how do you see the map ?
i 'll get there around . thanks for your help .
actually i am a transfer passenger . i have to get in the airport by flight . can i have my baggage ?
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
not much as we can . i have to pay rise per day .
you can say that by the way does it really hurt ?
the main external factors .
the problem is that i don t have an idea . the government is much more expensive than the car .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i m pretty tired . i haven t been sleeping well .
oh i 'm glad you did n't expect you to do so . you do n't have a fine holiday to relax .
but he is always talking big .
what an idiot !
it 's a secret .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . .
a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decided that for you yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
ok ! we have a great variety of chinese food .
me too . i could n't wait to play on the jungle gym .
yeah . i can t wait to play well . what are you doing next saturday ?
you are right . but i think we 'll soon get there .
it is very interesting . i like it very much .
i know what you mean but i 'm getting sleepy .
i think it starts at 8 o 'clock .
i 'm going to miss you too .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well let me go through the window .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i think we should .
it sounds interesting .
is it very cold in the winter ?
okay . thank you .
i think so .
no i am from south america .
you mean you like it ?
a new home health monitor ?
i am a spring and i hope to see them soon .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
that 's all right .
could you ask me to take a look ?
this is the view from the top of your stay there .
come on ! don t be silly .
could you please ?
i need to go and talk to you .
what s the problem ?
thank you .
do n't mention it .
the same to you !
are you going anywhere ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
fine . i ll be ready in a minute .
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
i ve got a fever and really a bad headache .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
maybe the food i will take about 20 minutes .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we can t get you to a hospital for an xray .
i 'm fine with the hospital .
it might be . the most important thing is that you get a check that might be fixed .
you 're married .
even her mom ?
you 're right . he is a nice guy and very considerate .
oh that sounds great . what does he look like ?
but she did n't think about it .
i guess it 's time for us to leave .
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
can you print it out before 12 o 'clock ? i need it this afternoon .
yeah you are right . you know he probably would n't make it up to date with him .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
yes but the only thing i 've ever done is zip you up besides i told all my other girlfriends and my wife who 's getting suspicious . and we had a cold for a while tell the
that 's easy .
it 's really nice of you . i 'm so moved by .
you mean we can t make a vote for him .
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
what about her facial ?
oh no . what about her ? she s got a beautiful face and a lot of weeks .
no but i did n't . i 'm working in the post office .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i 'm not sure where she is .
you 've got a lot of homework . she 's my teacher .
no i do n't want to put my hair down .
yes he 's coming .
oh i am so sorry . i did n't know you had a long time .
nothing really .
well that 's life .
i do n't know . i hope it 's nothing serious .
i know i should but it looks great but i 'm a bit worried .
no it s bigger than her .
how ?
you are such a good catch !
those are quarrelling .
sounds good .
if the aid is available they will give you two or more application forms one is for admission the others are for the aid .
ok i will ! what about this red underwear ?
the brain food .
i will try . she s very sorry .
sorry i 'm afraid we have n't had one . would you like a glass of wine or no ?
a party or tuesday .
i 'll be there .
oh great ! i 'm going to celebrate it !
what was the date of the reservation ?
you 're kidding .
that s the one of these classes .
of course .
is it the wedding anniversary of her wedding ?
we 're going to buy a new apartment in <unk> .
yeah . i really wanted to go out with you .
why ?
that s what i am doing .
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
a boss likes him a lot . he s a very nice person .
yes . good for you .
ok . . . no wonder you 're right . just the hot pot seem to be comfortable in and full of whatever they can do .
oh that would be lovely . shall we say seven o clock ?
i 'm a bus driver . she said she would be given me a good job .
this is a family business . they should go to the beach there .
i know . but if i do n't know the exact time i will do it .
what about the phone ?
you mean he had the whole round ?
i understand . that 's why i never thought about it .
that 's not true . but we still have some difficulties . besides you work out and do n't give up too much pressure .
thank you for your kindness .
really ? i remember that they were quite qualified for me .
how was your flight ?
i 'm sorry again for the inconvenience .
i see but i do n't think you will like it . please give me a a break .
yes it 's pretty .
good for you . the company is very nice with all the information you need . i think you 'll be a good candidate .
you 're right . maybe it 's a little rushed . i just ca n't deal with so many things .
well you could just talk to her about the safety of the year .
you know if i were you i would not put crime in her movies .
go ahead .
ok i will .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .
ok got it . i ll call you sometime next week .
fine .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
bye jason .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it was necessary but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
is there a problem with it ?
what are you talking about ?
yes of course .
no it 's the best part .
i agree . all the games are good .
for fun ! i never knew anything about it .
you are a quick learner . i 'll bet he 'll do well .
i have been looking forward to it for a long time .
what kind of food do you want to get ?
my brother inlaw just dropped in from the states .
maybe not . but in case he 's going to give him an answer on his business card .
yes i like it very much .
i know . can you tell me why you like to play ?
it 's great . i like it very much .
no i do n't .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just <unk> it ?
oh yes . you really should go and play ball yourself rather than watching games .
no he did n't .
well it 's over there . what do you think ?
and then what did he say to him ?
good idea . i will take the racket .
how ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
here 's your ticket and change .
oh i 'm so sorry .
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yeah i ll probably just stay in and relax . maybe watch a few movies .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
you 're right ! he 's a hard worker !
then after you sand it you use tack cloth to wipe off any dust or sawdust .
what are you going to do ?
what s the score ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
would you like to go to church ?
you 're kidding . but he 's so helpful .
i sure would .
how about the meeting in london ?
it 's too difficult to park your car in the city .
did n't you hear ? he also broke up with his girlfriend recently and his son was ripped off .
are you sure ?
do you have an ipod ?
then i 'll pick it up for you .
of course i think so .
what kind of antivirus software do you use ?
do you have a cell phone ?
pretty is she ?
of course not . but he 's as helpful as you to know .
you are so kind .
you mean he has a hard time like that .
a good idea .
all right . thanks again for your help .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
what 's wrong ? you have been a lot lately !
john is such a bad guy . i will never go to the beach with me !
what s the problem ?
there is a shop nearby ?
look at the long line they have different areas in show up and are walking around . that s good news .
yes i know what you mean . i m ready to put my hair out and look at the same level .
ok . i guess this is a good idea .
yeah but that 's a good idea . you know i am working in a company .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?

ok . our company is over on the noisy side . is there any way to fix it ?
have you received any scholarships ?
honey seriously it s just a sheep . relax ! relax that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable .
what s the big problem ?
you re joking ! this is a very cool game ! you can t just try to get the ball !
i m sorry to hear that . you re a little nervous .
it was ! but we do n't have any !
that was before he heard stanley s got married ! i guess he could have a great time !
you are welcome !
let me just do it . do you want me to go with you ?
oh yes i love the smell of the grass . it is so beautiful and the music has a map .
i know what you mean . i am a little nervous ! you know how to express their habits and i have to be your friends !
that 's great . what did the side say ?
yeah most of the time it was on my own .
oh that was a shame . you were such a good girl .
really ? i thought you were making a bookcase . don t you ever have to wait until i find it ?
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i can t believe i was sure i could do it . i won t let you go around and see what i think .
no it s not . he s too proud of me .
i do n't know . i guess i ll be glad to do it .
whoa ! i m sorry sir . . . you look great ! what are you talking about ?
that s great ! i bet he ll enjoy himself .
wow that was just the one .
me too .
dad i m gonna catch a cold .
no the other one . . . yes .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes that 's fine . i think it 's also a good idea . can i try it on ?
where do they come from ?
geez ! now you just make a federal sign . if we 'll talk about it in person .
that s all right . let s see . . . now it s still a hard time to learn and get to know what he s doing . i ll see myself in a week .
that 's exactly what i have to do now .
i pulled you over because it 's already taken .
oh i know . i m a crazy fan of them .
i think i 'll love that myself .
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
there must be many others .
no problem .
nothing .
no i 'm not sure . just in case .
i overheard your left foot into my machine .
i think you 'll like it .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
why are you so calm ? are you not surprised to hear this ?
i hope so . we wo n't need any trouble if you 'd like .
how did the business trip go ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
if i do n't do that in the morning could you ?
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
wow ! what a great job !
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had had enough of art galleries cathedrals statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
i hid so that it could n't see me . slowly it got closer and closer until . .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it 's hard to keep track of everything around here .
just a minute . let me get my camera together .
yes . i have . i think he s very good .
what do you think about cocktail ?
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
do n't be a fuss . it 's fun .
yes it displays some <unk> based on the <unk> plate which greatly increased the speed of limousines .
i think so .
my wife has been pregnant for about two people .
you mean you happen to be married ?
wait a minute pleasemr . wong i 'm terribly sorry . our delivery truck had an accident today . i 'm afraid your sofa wo n't be delivered until tomorrow .
definitely . but his wife has never married before .
it 's true . just hope people can make a big marriage for each other .
if i remember correctly people used to love me .
i know what you mean too .
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
you can say that again ! you 're very kind and italian .
really ? is there anything i can do for you ?
i feel they 're dirty .
i see . is that right ? it 's already 7 pm a . m . to start in any transaction .
that 's a good idea . you know what the teacher said in a car and i have to say i 'll show you some good friends .
well the chinese use a lot of employees quite different manners in british countries . we have a lot of guess . everyone in taiwan usually do n't drink that much coffee do n't they ?
really ? i will take it .
i do n't think so . i will go to a lower price .
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
well i would be pretty silly if i could be there around 200 people .
she is my wife .
so the other large number ?
do people get married young ?
i think we 'll make a reservation . but it 's the same name .
he said he had to leave the company without wearing any public transport system .
sure . but do you think it will be safe to get a passport ?
we 're going to make a decision until we go to the same thing . there are some free places nearby .
that s ok . is it serious ?
ouch that hurts did you have anything from ?
i met with my parents at a party .
really ? but i 'm not a child .
i can t find a policeman .
i agree with you . but we just do n't know the ancient chinese culture .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
i bet he is n't too happy about that .
yeah . it s a good way to learn english well .
do you have a prescription ?
but it takes a long time to make a happy marriage . you have no guts to know for it .
yes we do . we think you 'll be interested in the domestic market .
the special effects is different from what you need to make . besides you can use the room for a special day tour .
good luck out there .
no problem . i will check my schedule . do you have any other plans ?
yeah i know . it is a fantastic neighborhood .
will you be able to make more money in the company ?
i see . we could go to a dance club and have a good time .
well you know i have some students studying for their master 's degree . one of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
ok .
it 's an old song . the kids and the food are cook . we can go to a ball game then make some final decision .
that sounds good . let 's go .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
certainly .
i think something must be done .
certainly .
what do they look like ?
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
you should be happy too !
but i would n't mind working out .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
no . but they 're not used to be able to talk to boys who were good at school .
so do i . the fish is very healthy .
yes we do . do you like it ?
the pretty good . i think it ll be very soon . where do you want to go ?
i 'm going to do some shopping .
what 's the matter ?
please have them ready this afternoon .
i love the idea . i 've always wanted to see the movie .
yes of course .
ok . i am going to need you to fill in the form and the name is the library .
i 'm going to try to write you a ticket . do you want to put it here ?
let me know if you 're not .
we 'd like to go to tianjin .
yeah . i 'll try so hard to keep it up .
yes . the girl i 've been here for three years .
you have n't heard of it yet .
i do n't like it .
a flight must be taken off from the doctor . you cannot move your luggage from him . it 's about 20 minutes .
wait . we have to return to our homeroom and wait to be dismissed .
yes i 've been thinking about visiting a few days now . but i do n't know what to do .
ok . but do you have any hobbies ?
i know . playing chess is a very aggressive experience . it 's kind of rules .
there 's no doubt the internet will be a powerful commercial medium . it 'll connect hundreds of millions of customers and open up huge markets for example music while collecting stamps .
come on let 's break up and sit down . i think about the same thing .
yes . what about you ?
hey ! congratulations !
really ? that s great ! you must be very happy with that !
it 's a <unk> palace right ? my favorite city of course .
i do n't know . i mean to work hard . all my friends are really a big fan of inviting me .
why do n't you go to bed and get up early ?
i 've got to go . you know how i can be able to get through the bus with a bus stop and take the bus . and the bus is holding too much for me to get into the university .
but it is a long time for you to work out your company .
i bought it two years ago .
sorry . i did n't realize it was so late . i 'm going to bed early .
i 'm a little short . i 'll have to take a taxi .
it sounds too bad . how long has it take ?
i appreciate you telling me .
what did he say ?
what did he do ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
it 's very cold and windy .
it is only a crowded breeze so i wo n't be late .
i know . i have to go by myself .
well this is going to be a great opportunity for me to get her some of my old friends and then i 'll go with her .
that 's my favorite .
so what ?
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . .
sure thanks . just this afternoon .
no thank you .
in china it was bought on the 12th of a library from america .
no i have n't . the only thing i can do is that i am interested in in .
that 's a good idea to find employment agency .
well we do n't have the same problem with our part . the <unk> of our marriage is to us .
my wife wants me to go to the us for a movie .
she 's my grandma . she 's my only teacher .
wait a minute let me check it out . oh an application form ?
guess !
even the most people in the world do n't they ?
ask away .
ok . let 's just go !
sure i have . why are you acting up in class ?
but i really do n't like it .
i 'm doing great .
no . why ?
your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so .
no way !
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
so how do i get to the train station ?
it 's so cool . it was a bit conservative .
well apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . typical is n't it ?
unbelievable ! i don t think you re right . i know she is used to be used but that s crazy .
well you should have been more careful .
do you have your cell phone with you ?
i guess i ll try to make it .
oh that s a good idea . i don t know how many people get it from .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
i had meetings back to back all morning . and phone rang off the hook from the minute i walked into the office .
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
well maybe if there is something i can mail it out now .
sir in order to send you a new document .
about four days ago .
that 's good for these days . do you think you will ever lose your job ?
yes i m fine . i ve been out of town . i just got back .
no problem . i guess you ll have to keep a face .
maybe . but everyone likes coffee and
i feel so sorry i . but i still feel it is two months sick .
really ? you mean you met jane ?
yes . she is a teacher of aerobics .
really ? i m very surprised . he doesn t look like a guy who d ever do that sort of thing right ?
she is very nice . she asked me to put her through .
next june .
you re right . i guess you re right . i just wish my parents didn t come and talk to me .
do you think so ? you are the right person for him .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well . we ve got everything taken care of already .
when will you find out ?
all the laundry will be ready by 5
that 's all i 'm going to do now .
i m so happy for you !
have you booked the hotel for the reception ?
the palace hotel .
i hope it s true ! if you would get a raise i ll take care of it and get a raise .
you can get used to it . we don t want to be so much fun in the city .
i want to know about that but i think it s also something like that .
as you know china has a singlechild policy . therefore there s just my husband my daughter and i . what about in your family ?
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
about seven years now . and you ?
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
ha ha ha i ll keep that in mind but don t tell my husband .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .
cindy s husband is ron .
how many children do cindy and ron have ?
they have two childrenone son and one daughteras well as one daughterinlaw and one soninlaw .
do they have any grandchildren ?
yes they have three grandchildrenone girl and two boys .
does their daughters get along well with her inlaws ?
yes she gets along with them quite well .
do they have a large family ?
their family is very similar to cindy and ron s family .
he s 21 . how old is james ?
he 's a year older than keith but he looks younger .
how s your father ?
he 's been out of work for a couple of days .
how did he make a fortune ?
oh i don t think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
you said it . we ca n't find any customers at this corner .
how do you want to spend your old age ?
in the same way probably .
i 'm sorry . i thought you 'd be a lie .
it 's very kind of you .
you are a real pal ! i 'll call you later .
yes i do .
glasses ?
okay no problem .
yeah . i saw him last week . it seems he was a bit queer in the head .
my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .
how about tomorrow afternoon ?
well then i need a flight to chicago and we 'll have to cancel the flight .
i will be here in a minute .
ha ! it 's my pleasure .
good night then !
pleased to meet you . i believe you were a wellmatched couple .
do n't worry . i 'll wait here for you .
goodbye alice .
you 're welcome .
you re welcome . what s the problem ?
do you have an appointment with you ?
yes . the theater is located on the three parts of a circle line . my name is zhang lin . and i would like to change my reservation .
may i have your name and phone number ?
i 'll get your address for you .
i 'm going to need you to hurry .
bye !
do n't you think so ? i 'm sure he 'll make it a little mistake .
i should finish it as soon as possible .
um . . .
i 'm probably going to spend the day looking at cars .
i 'm probably just going to see a movie .
oh really ? that 's nice .
well she did her baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces .
yeah are you going to come ?
how 'd you miss it ?
do you have a preference for anything ?
at 8 o 'clock . i will make the reservation .
oh well how many people has she given invites to so far ?
i 'd better see you there .
i must go to the library to see you there .
nothing much what 's going on ?
a lot like the party i 'm having on friday .
oh really ? that 's nice .
yes and i agree with all his policies .
no i 'm not .
you have to do something romantic .
it s primarily design for business transactions . that is write checks to pay the bills buying things and sending money . we won t expect a large amount of deposit in current account .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
well that 's okay . you can go to the service centre to make a decision .
do you ? then you can see that we have one wish that is to conclude this transaction in a way that will satisfy both sides . what can you do to help ?
i like music that has a fast beat and is lively like dance music . you know i go to a disco almost every week . sometimes it 's too loud though . you prefer classical music don t you ?
what 's so great about it ?

did you see the results ?
that s a great idea . let s go and see if we can get together .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .

in that case how many days will i be at the meeting ?
you are very welcome . have a nice day .
yes i did . it was one of the conditions of the insurance policy .
i see . what did you do after that ?
i began to went there last month .
our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . can you serve them in english ?
i needed to check .
actually i could ask you some questions about pet . i think that 's why i am taking the job .
it 's too late . i 'm a little short . could you give me some advice ?
for example your passport and id card . you can apply to the butterfly stroke
yes . you have been very good taste for this kind of food . i think that you should give me an idea of how much you think .
well there 's a special project that we can help you with . you already have a computer so you can use an project .
ok . i advise the shipping costs 260 dollars a month .
we need to go to the butterfly stroke . do n't you think workers should be involved in this field ?
500 yuan . and if you buy it today there will be a 15 discount for you .
i have been working here for three years .
it 's common practice to expand our business relations from marketing research .
yes we have . i product launches in five years .
so there must be something wrong with them .
yes i do . there are only three different rooms available in my country . i can send my email to you if it 's not clear enough .
maybe so but i think it 's just too hard to deal with and how much i can spend on washing clothes every year .
you 're welcome .
i feel my greatest asset is perseverance that is the ability to stick to things to get them done .
why do you think you be a good fit or this job ?
i tend to get bored easily and so love to keep myself challenged .
i am sure you do well .
it was 3 years ago and we were employed as a technician with company or approximately 10 years .
that 's exactly where i was planning to go !
yes i work well under pressure and find it dimly . however i believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines .
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
i think that i 've got good opportunities to enjoy working with people . in fact i have worked on a project for more than just two years and i enjoy the challenge of developing my career .
well what about the salary ?
i stick to my principles and keep to the rules . sometimes they just lack enthusiasm . when i get them involved with something constructive some of them change their attitude later .
i like photography very much . i used to be awarded second prize in a photography contest at our university .

thank you . i 'm looking forward to it .
fully agree . i do enjoy the convenience though i am still a beginner in using excel . the latest office equipment is more typefunctional . it combines fax machine copy machine and printer in one . it saves a lot of place one machine instead of three .

about seven years now . and you ?

my husband my motherinlaw my daughter and i .
working for your company ! as the top administrative assistant in your firm !
good answer miss zhanggood answer ! seriously though are you interested in staying in a stafflevel position or would you hope to move into management someday ?
well i have n't thought much about this . i think it 's too early to tell . what is the most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . if the company is happy with my work then i think i would like to consider other positions in the company .
i hope to major in english literature but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year so we ll see .
do you have any experience in this field ?
i am in beijing .
what was your major ?
yes i have been there for two years .
what degree did you have ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .

yes i have studied in an english training program and a computer training program since i graduated from university . i am currently studying finance at a training school .
what kind of work were you responsible for in the past employment ?
yes i passed college english test band 6 with good skill in listening speaking reading and writing . i have n't got any certificate of computer skills because i don t think certificates are necessary if what s needed is merely operating a computer . i think practically to know how to use a computer is more important . and i am quite familiar with microsoft office .
yeah i 've been working so much overtime lately .
really ? how come ?
my boss gave me a big project . i had to have it finished by this morning . it was so difficult .
you should n't work so hard .
i work hard at the beginning but it is not very easy to get used to it .

i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
i am studying languages . this year i have been awarded to english literature and in english .

what was your major ?
i love no . 4 .
anything else ?
i 'd like to say i was an expert if you could n't give it up .
i received a bachelor 's degree .
so it has a history of education . . .
i feel i will try to get my knowledge and experience ready to use in management .
what do the next step into my previous job ?
i will try to do my best to get things done on .
there s the big cavity and the crown was loose . we have a yellow walls right ?
nice to meet you ! my name is peter smith .
this is a first day !
nice to meet you too !
well hope you will enjoy your first day !
ok ! i hope you will ! take care of yourself .
you 're welcome .
can you give me a ride home ?
i know . but if you can do it well .
that 's right . we have no one to turn to master 's degree .
i want to get a puppy for my son .
why ?
i m paid 2000 yuan per month .
your decision is not fair . you know it is a little higher than you expected . when your starting school i will give you a chance .
we will . it 's a can do on us .
well i was just thinking about it i made some pretty much pressure to share .
that 's a little bit high .
i m pretty happy living there .
no problem .
you have a company car or two days .
that 's not all i do to finish ?
they are different .
oh i see . they are just jealous of me .
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
yes i can .
what do you think of the literature course ?
it was an english professor .
you are right mr . white .
why do you plan to change your job ?
yes . maternity leave is mentioned in the contract but there s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . do you offer anything to fathers ?
certainly . let s get a bonus at the end of this year .
they take care of a lot of things .
it s a job that pays for your medical dental and disability .
all right .
yes . we can do something else if you like .
all right . i need to think about it .
sounds just perfect . everyone is really looking forward to doing something new .
yes . maternity leave is mentioned in the contract but there s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . do you offer anything to fathers ?
what will you do in the future ?
actually some chinese food are included in the short hand .
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i 'm studying in the foreign languages department .
i guess english has fewer characters .
i learned to be patient professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .
i do n't know that but i believe i college was very happy with it .
you mean you like working for foreign languages ?
i studied english literature and i read english literature but i can read and write it pretty well .
sure . i can make lots of effort to see the employees before i work .
how many words a minute ?
it sounds interesting .
oh . . . i m sorry . but we 've never thought of that .
how long will it take to get to shanghai .
take us to the yellow road and you will have a good time .
yes sir . i 'll bring it over . have you ever been there ?
yes it 's very nice of you .
i 'm going to the untied states for travel . what places do you recommend ?
how many words a minute ?
it s about a real bargain actually .
do you have anything else i can have instead ?
that 's a good idea . i think i can do a lot of traveling .
i ve a strong filling only takes it which i use it to practice it regularly .
good . why ?
i have working knowledge of windows and dos . actually i 'm quite familiar with both java and c programming languages .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
do you know how to use a pc to process the management information ?
i found it a garage sale once .
maybe it is a kind of strange habit .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
what ? i am interested in your words .
i don t believe how to deal with the development of the company .
in this way it is impolite to be able to understand the interviewer in your words .
only in this way can you leave the interviewer a good impression and achieve success .
only if you make mistakes are not good at the end of this month .
gee how dangerous ! i 've almost knocked him down .
but i am not familiar with the design of software products .
what 's that ?
what about all my personal information ?
in the past two weeks is between the company and the employees can get a further salary of 50 and the employee .
yeah i think so .
yes . the fitting room is this way please .

okay . here we go .
it includes your air fare your hotel accommodations and the meals .
i 'm going to get a phone card .
no .
how about my educational background ?
sure like this .
but i should have known that every month .
why do you choose the law school ?
i 've been fed up with study .
no you should n't let the chance . you should teach the attention .
how long do you think it will be ?
yes i 'm calling to speak to mr wang .
i am proud to know that he will be our assistant manager .
you do n't know that .
i think we 'll send you a letter next week if you are wanted or we may give you a call . by the way have you got a telephone ?
i can not agree with you . your company is a little higher than other companies .
but there is a long line .
it 's very kind of you . thank you very much .
do you think it 's a good idea to be an interpreter ?
just do your best to get off at the next stop and be honest with the human resource office .
i will give you a call later on it .

how much ?
how do you spend your time in sales department ?
you mean the smaller car ?
well we 'd better get you another pair .
how about you daniel ?
we are waiting to hear the quality .
yes and i agree with all his policies .
yes i have found three companies . i have worked in your company as a salesman for one year .
mr . bergeron . the price is still a little tight .
yes there are two brothers living here .
your price is reasonable but i wonder if you would give us a discount .
you know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . the prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where .
i do n't know what to suggest . your prices are much too high .
we 've got about 20 years but we also need a loan of our staff .
what do you need ?
i need to talk to you about that new driver you ve hired . i think i am going to have some problems working with him .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what do you mean ?
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
i don t think i ve ever had a job before but i decided to take a few minutes .
i think that we could change our part . what do you think ?
exactly . the software engineers are testing it just now . they should be done by friday .
yes you have . i think the internet is also a good idea to have a look at the internet . but there are many other programs and applications nearby .
no really ?
yes flexible aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
think you will make it easier .
could i ask you some questions ?
okay . work harder next week .
yes some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
it s good to hear from you and explain to me your english . it is more important to me .
sure it s not very far from here . can you put a picture of the stuff in the book ?
well if you just decide to get a business card we could also get a discount of 4 to 6 .
have you ever considered taking a career of a lower rebate ?
the <unk> ? what about the sunroof ? are the bulletin board ?
i hate to disappoint you mr . brown but if you can make an exception and accept d p . m . or we have to pay special attention to what you say .

i 'm quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend in <unk> . the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
guangzhou university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .

no i can only carry on a simple conversation in french .

i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed <unk> .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .
yes i want to change some money .
i 'm mary kelly . may i ask your name ?
my name is b . how are you miss kelly ?

yes i would .
how much ?
yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let s go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism and this seemed like a g
certainly . and after your internship ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes . i see . but you must be in charge of a 5 day .
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m 27 and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around 16 .
ah i see so you were actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
very interesting . so what do you think of his business ?
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?

yes it s right .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .

what are they ?
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .

other company rules also need your attention .

you have no idea how happy i am for you .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
do you have a cold ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .

what kind of case do you have ?
what s your plea ?
i was told by the officer that i ran a red light . that information is n't true .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you ?

yes of course . what 's the weather like in your country ?

we have n't come here in business but for pleasure . we should go out exciting . what can you see in the subway ? nothing !

i do n't want to make any changes to my old card .

you are welcome . see you next time .
it looks delicious .
ok . then i 'll see that .
all right . shall we take a map of the world ?

here you are .
my brother inlaw just dropped in from the states .
it 's said that the goods are sold out well as the new product is good .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
thank you very much . there are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . will you please check them on ?
we 've already been in touch with your <unk> .
the goods are wellexamined before shipment . i 'm afraid the losses must have occurred on the earth .
ok i will take one .
ok i will try .
the best part is to me .
thank you .
thank you .
well you know the price of our products are of superior quality . so if i 'm not sure i 'll have to pay off with them .
all right .
i know . but we ca n't accept your quality . you can try us on the yours .
this price has been reduced by 50 .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
in that case we 'll do it well .
there 's information on deposit or loan rates exchange rates . . .
that would be nice . can i read the characters ?
you 'll have to put the bag on your right side .
i hope you get me some details about your new position .
i do n't like it . but i do n't think it 's realistic .
oh thank you very much .
you 're welcome .
it 's our pleasure . we are always happy to have you here . please have a seat .
our prices are subject to our prices . we re interested in buying them . our prices are much too large .
yes we will cancel that . a time when we have final review the contract and see what we would like to see .
ok in order to get a passport and a passport . will you be paying by cash ?
but what about that our bottom line ?
i 'm a journalist . i write for the general manager of the fareast industry corporation .
what do you do for a living ?
i am afraid to say that it 's a little higher . our agents in other areas usually get a 3 to 6 commission .
yes mr . by the way how many words do i have to work with you ?
ok . i think that 's the exact time i was thinking of going to my little tight .
i 'm coming to your office at nine o 'clock .
we can start with payment by installments .
to meet you half way i 'm afraid we ca n't reduce it to an annual contract .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
wow a lot of money ! how about the training center ?
so let me see . you know how many years we have married per year . that 's our first time .
we have already gone through an agreement with us on this town . but i can make it this time .
i 'm sorry peter . but if you can talk about our proposal now .

that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
what time is your appointment ?
yes . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
thanks . do you want to get them goods to step up production by three percent ?
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
if you need any further information about it please do n't be a problem .
i 'm sorry . i thought this was the right time .
it is our 10th wedding anniversary this june 20 .
i said by the middle of october . this is the best we can promise .
now what is your name ?
i thought you had an elephant in your house .
what time is your appointment ?
i 'm sorry peter . we ca n't do any more business with you .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
i think so .
it 's still too long . i ca n't wait to do any more .

all right . but i 'm only in on saturday . could you deliver this project for me ?
you can guarantee the quality of the inspection system which is better than others .
can you weigh them for me ?
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
yes sir . we 'll pack it up .
of course . if you order more than 10000 units we can reduce it to 12 .
this is ok . let 's call it a deal .
well . we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l c payable against shipping documents .
i see . could you make an exception and accept d a or d p ?
no problem .
according to the usual practices we 'll have to pay in touch with our credit rating and payment terms .
to be honest mrs . wang you must have told me that an irrevocable letter of <unk> it gives the exporter needs to know of our exports . we always require l c for our exports . and the other way round we will accept l c for our imports .
we can do that on this card .
are you having problems with it ?
let me see here . your eyes and ears look fine . take a deep breath please . do you smoke mr . smith ?
ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest of small changes please .
ok here you are .

i see . how do i draw money from my news then .
yes . how much do you want ?
fifty dollars . what is the exchange rate today ?

i can get them back at the quickly .
how was it ?
thank you .

it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind .
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
i ve been out of town . i just got back .
so what would you say about your work ?
i 'm dead tired .
could i please look at this letter please ?
could you please tell me about the chinese currency you want to withdraw ?
do you know how to do the bank account ?
i ve already been paid for some dollars .
see that ! how much is it ?
did you have a good journey ?
i 'm proud of you for standing by 50 . i really do n't think you re looking at this line for a nice change of 20 .
don t mention it .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
i know . you re going to find an expensive country on it .
this guy just robbed me right on the street .
in what way did all the questions make ?
what can you do when you feel convenient ?
well you can t be assured of that . we also provide free accommodation meals for our new market .
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s a problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yes . can i see that tshirt on the top shelf please ?
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
