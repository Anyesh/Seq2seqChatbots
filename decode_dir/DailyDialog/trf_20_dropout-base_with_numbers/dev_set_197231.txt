i think so .
thanks very much . i appreciate it .
no it 's too crowded .
dad . here comes another bus .
fine . let 's get on . oh no judy ! get off the bus quickly !
why ? dad ?
we got on the wrong bus .

yes . what 's the problem ?
you mean the boy you met him last night ?
yes i 'll call her later .
tom has gone to lunch .
you 'll have to pay one for the gas station if you need anything .
do you think this music is warm matched ?
oh that means i ca n't make sure for my own .
i am not sure the next time it is .
it depends on the job . it 's actually more costeffective than buying specialist equipment that we do n't use very often .
do you want to go to an empty classroom ?
would you like a drink ?
how long will it take to get there ?
do you have any used textbooks to help me ?
there is no one here by that name .
yes mum .

of course he 's out of a meeting at the moment .
oh yeah . this is penny 's pet boutique . i ca n't wait to see him now .
anytime before the early gets up please .
what can i do for you ?
he is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
what 's that ?
do you know which one he would like ?
you bet .
it 's this hightech equipment that doctors my voice a little . actually i am tonedeaf .
of course i am the top student .
ok .
i 'm glad to meet you . i do n't want to have any rooms sir .
it feels all right . but if it were a darker color i 'd like it better . this seems too light for winter . do you think you could get me one ?
it 's my pleasure .
no i do n't like this . it 's too heavy .
i think i 'd like to say that this myself . my name is thomas smith .
that 's why i did n't go in the states . when they were still in love with you .
ok . i will bring it to you right away .
right .
what are you talking about ? take a lot of things .
what time is it now ?
better late than never .
i 'm very sorry .
is it expensive to go ?
yes i do . you can go to the transport department to get yourself a bus schedule and a bus route map .
that 's good . let 's go !
yes . i think you should go there by bus and get a bus .
i want to pick up my parcels .
i ll show you the way .

your clock never works . perhaps i should go .
i must have slept right through it .
rise and shine ! sleepyhead !
it 's excellent . well what do you do then ?
what 's the matter ?
yes maybe it does . but if you 're going to drive like you did just now you will have to get used to a little physical pain . you know what i mean ?
oh no . i forget about it .
it 's a great pleasure to meet you .
is it ready to eat right ?
i guess you 'd better get some rest .
i just ca n't help it . in fact it 's my fault .
no thanks . i just went to bed and watch my calories .
how about the mongolian hot pot ?
that 's not good . i am afraid we have n't had time for a walk .

it 's great !
i am going to the railway station .
that 's harsh .

i 'll stop at my house at the corner of my hotel tonight .
yes but i am not sure if you can find a guide .
thank you very much .
no problem . would you like some artificial carnations ?
oh no . carnations are not very elegant . artificial flowers have no passion .
how much did you want to spend ?
money is no object .
our most elegant flower is golden lily .
i will take ten .
do you want to add some baby s breath for that ? they are equally popular now .
of course . can you check my blood on it ?

how many years have you worked in the company ?
actually i was thinking that i d have to get a new one . that 's good to know .

would you like to put it in a leather belt ?
can you find a brand new carpet and the quality difficult ?
its <unk> will be a big surprise to you .
well i have the same question . i think that s why many people call the police .
it is n't gratitude . it 's fear . vince is afraid i 'll jump to a competitor .
could you give me a discount ?
ok . let 's go .
that sounds great .
why do n't we call them ?
what about the olympic park ?

it 's hard work while exercising but it is a great feeling when i get done .
yeah . it s a good diet and it s fun to keep your weight .
i agree . i think our advertising is the most important thing .
it 's a secret . you know what ?
what 's the reason for your call ?
i 'm glad to hear that . thanks .
yes you 're right . in fact there is also a terrible headache .
what are you talking about ?
really ? this is too bad . how much is it ?
i 'm sorry to say that we have to let you go john .

it was a rather big surprise .
it has been many years since it was here .
i usually run every day .
what do you do exactly mean ?
and then prepare what you want to receive . if you want to send a photograph you must copy one .
sounds like a good idea . what about a gila monster and human spider ?
i see . did you go to the computer center instead ? you have to use more information or <unk> .
i 'm going to work with a local tv station .
it 's hard for me to sleep .
i never go to places that is hard for me .
what do you mostly do during your workout ?
well i walk every day .
in that case you want to work with less weight . you can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . five kilo weights should be enough . now it s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .
about three times a week if i can .
i would like to use the copy machine .
ok . please fill in this form and i 'll see if it goes to the car .
no problem .
i want to give you a gift that is really meaningful .
oh the exterior is only half of the story .
yes . we have a very natural windows so it 's small .

i hope so .
i 'm serious .
you are very modest . thank you for your help .

sure here is my friend 's pet that 's a little far from her house . she said i 'd like a glass of perfume for her wedding .
my mom has a <unk> on her nose . she has a mole on her face .
i had a <unk> question with a girl . something like that in instead of a sudden ring i felt a bit crazy .

i know but i just was n't thinking of getting off my mind . and i do n't have enough time to get lost .
well if you insist i have to order the new dish . i 'm sure it will be too cold .
all right we can get ourselves but we only have a big breakfast !
i hope it hasn t been our fault .
i want a chemise .
oh look at these two watches are n't they lovely ?
yes we do . your company has a very good reputation in the field .
well since it 's summer and it looks like you 've had quite a bit of sun i 'd recommend our summer special . it 's especially suited for individuals with sensitive skin .
good . i will take it .
here is the latest model .
well could you put me in a nonsmoking section for me ? i m not sure .
i am afraid it 's too far to wash off .
could you give me some napkins ?
oh where is it ?
the ad says a current account that pays in the job market .
when ?
which ad would i like to have ?
it 's interesting .
we have to make sure that our prices are so good .
duh . . . and it s the point . the people in the ads are wearing what 's in . plus i can see all over the world .
i would prefer to go home myself .
yes . it seems made to me .
oh dear .
yeah . let me think about it .
but i want to start learning how to use other switches .
are you going to enjoy all your stay here ?
yes . i 'd like a cup of onion soup .
i have been using them all in stock for quite a long time . will this do ?
you 'd like a smoking or nonsmoking room ?
about 7 people who live in the area of the city sights .
but i ca n't find them one by the chinese .
okay . the time i 'm almost here . i 'd better take a look .
the style is all right but i 'm not sure about the color . let me think for a while .
have a pleasant stay .
yes i 'd like another cup of coffee .
here you are .
thank you .
mmm how much does it cost ?
as a matter of fact i have let you go .

and thanks for letting me know .
how about a little lower ?
yeah . i heard about your favorite coffee . let 's get some tea .
yes this is the best we can do .
well it looks great from the curb . let s go on inside .
i guess so .
i do n't think that 15 is our bill . maybe 20 would be plenty of fish .
good evening . my wife and i would like a room please . is there any room available ? we do n't have a reservation .
here you are . please check if you need any help .
well i would like to change our reservation .
who would you like to call me ?

yes i do . i have to work in the public office .
where is it ?
how much would you like to purchase ?
ok . i will look for a wonderful living here .
it s probably a good idea to find an expensive expensive expensive expensive expensive clothing store .
where is that ?
it 's the same in fact . we were supposed to have to work on someone .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
where is that ?
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
it 's better for both ways . if you ask me i 'm sure you 'll enjoy our stay in the world .
sure . i will send you a schedule as soon as possible .
could you please help me put my bags in the truck ?

it is convenient for me to work overtime tonight .
here you are .
thanks a lot .
yes here you are .
i 'll have a double whiskey on the rocks .
oh we have quite a variety of chinese tea and just make sure you like them .
sounds great ! we 'll take some meat .
thank you very much .
do you know when it leaves ?
you need to get off on the corner of del mar and hill .
thank you . where is the subway to ?
that 's a good idea . i always want to go to the zoo in the afternoon .
ha i 'm not really scared . what are you talking about ?

ok . well please read me in my book .
yes certainly .
oh i 'm sorry sir . i ca n't find a available one .

you get a dozen percent discount .
that 's rather too expensive . i ca n't afford it . could you give me a better price ?
if you think it 's expensive . you can look at this one .
why do you think that this would be a good move ?
certainly . do you take a tablecloth to her
have you decided what wine you would like ?
i want to tell you i 've put in my notice .
anything else sir ?
i 'd like it very much .
you missed a court appearance .
i see . i think the biggest environment problem is air pollution .
i decided to get a kick out of the city .
yes i think so . i bought it four months ago and it was still a big bargain .
that 's good ! a dozen will be always expensive .
you know how it is . i almost finished making a lot of money today .

i would like to book a ticket for this sunday .
well that 's true .
yes . i 'll give you a call from the entrance to the booth .
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
noirin noirin it 's an irish name .

thank you .
yes i 'm afraid there is .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i need to buy some flowers for my children .
probably not . doing that will probably take another three hours which i ca n't afford now .
great . here 's my visa credit card .
it 's only thirty yuan .
why do n't you send it by mail payment order ?
no problem . we offer packages .
noirin noirin it 's an irish name .

is it far ?
i think a cab is better .
oh good . that 'll be all for you .
you re welcome .
sorry . i 'm afraid that i have to buy you a pair of shoes .
can you make my hair short ?
well . cantonese food is rather light beijing food is heavy and sichuan food is usually hot and spicy .

i 'm not very particular about the design . but i 'm not sure you 'll like it .
i think you should go to a formal dance party . i 'm not sure which one do you want .
good idea ! but the fact is that many countries have high opinions of human beings .
of course . the fitting room is this way please .
thanks .
got it . to whom should i report ?
we have a lot of things .
what are the other guys ?
i did n't get it . what do you think of the bus ?
i understand . but i want you to know if i ca n't let me know .
you d better buy an article or you 'll get a good price .
well i just still like street shopping . so i can see more variety in one week .
excuse me ?
a laptop is on the desk . but you need to get an extension on your computer .
i would like to use the copy machine .
yes i do . what about this one ?
no thank you . i think the color is too bright .
well it is our office block . we have all the administrative depart <unk> there . down there are about 200 people in the world .
i don t know .
yes . the off the top . i was crying for three years .
you mean they were closed ?
because they have nothing to do with the girl .

what else is that ?
is there any other computer ?
i believe it .
i understand their phone .
sounds awful . where would you like to be ?
it sounds good . ok . i 'll take it .
am i ready for what ?
are you ready to transfer tomorrow ?
what 's wrong ?
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
do you mind if i can look at the piano ?
i 'll give you five more minutes then i 'm going on without you !
yes i did . do you want to go to a concert instead ?
ok . you can watch reruns of each player . this one is built in black . you can see supermarkets park and use drama costumes agates music while you are digital fan .

if you were on everyday let 's go to a movie .

can you come back in the morning ?
oh no ! that 's too late . i need an appointment so i must be expecting you next week .
ok i see .
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
i have a flight at four thirty .
not really . you should go see it .
i promise i will .
of course . go straight ahead and turn left at the third corner .
there is a pencil behind the playground and the tv station .
yes it does .
how far is it ?
you re welcome .
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
that d be great but could i have a cup of tea first ?
sure i ll just go put the kettle on . why don t you have a seat on the sofa and i ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .
i see . well i can help with the chores while i m here . you two could probably use my help .
that s very nice of you to offer . here s your tea . be careful it s still quite hot .
there is one at the corner of the fifth avenue .
thank you .
yes .
why do n't you try and give it up ?

it 's on your left side .
oh well . i 'll have to live with it . what else can i do ?
yes it is .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that might be going overboard a bit . how about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing .
that s even better than the real thing .
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than 100 you get a 50 voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
sure . the fitting room is right over there .
yes i 'm looking for a house .
this is kevin .

usually the problem is very expensive . but we do have a lot of expensive conditions on national newspaper . there are several possible sources of parents from hong kong and send it into us dollars .
very good ! and i 'd like to know a huge difference .
that 's something that you really need to work on .
it 's made in china .
yes i can . i m a good singer but i m very crazy about your own country .

how do they use coffee ?
are you kidding ?
no thank you . i 'd like some coffee .
yes that is why i have such a large selection .
well i guess you 're right .
of course ! i 'm going to miss you .
please give me a piece of pie first .
why do n't you try eating so much ?
just a moment and i 'll do that for you .
haha . . . what 's that ?
no problem . i ll go home .
what do you mean by that ?
you 're welcome .
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
do you know what to eat ?
how much is it ?
i 'm in the united states that 's exactly what i am interested in .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
um this steak i asked for to be medium rare .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
she 's a little nervous . what happened to her ?
how much is she ?
what did you do ?
do n't worry . you 've done a lot of good job . first of all you need to do is fill in the following blanks correctly on the card and the computer lab record .
one moment . do you want to withdraw some cash while you 're at it ?
i have read anything about the documents about your unit .
do you think it 's a good system to meet ?
this city is only half of the week .
are you scared of anything ?
would you like a hamburger and a bottle of wine ?
what are you going to do ?
you are booked on the <unk> on 1611 at <unk> pm to hong kong with cathy pacific .
so you have your own car ?
would you like anything to drink ?
i don t have it at all .
oh i see . you mean we can break the house right ?
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
you 're right . we 'll be in touch .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
if she started just sleep then you would n't have to stay home until just sleep .
about 50 miles .
that 's fine . i 'll do it in the afternoon .

would you tell me the kitchen ?
that 's good to hear . she is usually full of vein and <unk> .
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it s about an hour .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
all right .

you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .

today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .

how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
we will tell you if it has any change .
mangoes . what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
can you eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .

one thousand yuan .
okay i 'll take the red ones .

would you like some ice in your drink ?
i m happy to have the cocktail . i heard that you are a vegetarian . there is a fish counter in the neighborhood .
chinese dishes are exquisitely prepared delicious and very <unk> . they are very good in colour <unk> and taste .
let 's go to the bathroom .
well it s not you ve been a big help lately .
that 's for sure . i feel like i 'm melting .
is that our country is famous for its seafood ?
all the dishes are <unk> at the beginning of a week .
i ll get you another piece of meat .
well . ca n't you see the notes there ?
any place will be fine .
oh yes . it s just a few minutes walk .
my train will leave at 300
i 'm <unk> with family .
oh i do n't want it .
i think it s too cold .
i think train is a very crowded bus .
yes almost all the families have their own cars .
you just need a holiday .
mmm how can it be boring ? it sounds very interesting .
let s hit the whirlpool for a bit . it s too noisy . i was too nervous .
well could you pick up some sugar ?
sorry but he 's busy then too .
nobody told you what happened ?
i 'd rather not .
i think that i should take some credit cards .
i think that he might make a mountain out of a molehill . it 's only a superstition . it really does n't mean anything .
let s go shopping . i d rather get a discount on the soft sleeper though .
true . what are the odds of finding a pain ?
are you all right ?
it 's the worst time today .
why do n't you just ask the bus driver for a transfer ?
i like this company and i m a little older at home .
do you know how to use it ?
ok . i will send it by mail .
what kind of apartment are you looking for ?
i see . tell me about it .
yes it is . look over there . it says that you can t find it there .
good idea . would you like to ask me a few questions ?
where will you go sir ?
please take me to this address .
what about the international one ?
i have to be there before 17 o 'clock .
yes of course . let 's see .
400 yuan a week .
i 'll do that .
here 's twenty dollars .
well it 's about 40 .
oh i see .
please fill out this form .
yes i do .
hello madam . where are you ?
please take me to this address .
ok . here you are .
but you 'll promise not to be late for dinner .
1 500 yuan . how much do you want to pay ?
here is ten yuan .
it 's a private garden .
will you call the taxi ?
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
is there any line you would like to speak to ?
thank you very much .
hello claire . this is mick .
yes miss what is it ?
thank you . where should i send your final phone bill ?
yes i 'm .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
all right . i 'll see you in the future .
see you .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
12000 a year but you ca n't get visitors to live in .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello steven !
wow <unk> ! what a surprise !
it was almost two years ago .
i am doing ok .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
well ! it 's great news !
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
ok please . if you do n't mind i will call you when we get into the interview .
thank you very much .
do n't you hit it off ?
i began to went there last month .
i think we should be <unk> .
i have a terrific working relationship with my boss . he likes to be honest and needs totally telephone her .
what is your strongest trait ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it 's still a sad story .
he must have a lot of homework to do in language .
what happened ?
thank you .
but i am a little bit disappointed . i mean i could n't afford to pay the chance .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
i can take you on the top of the mountain and there s a big sign of the front . you should have to wait for the next right direction .
what are you doing when i am done ?
yeah ! i think that s a good idea . our marriage is almost two years old !
what should i do then ?
i ve never been a rock before ! i told you we could use some useful game !
uh i guess . sorry . i did n't know .
some of my friends play cards on the internet . so we 'll have a great time there .
there we are ! i can t help it .
i m looking for a sweater .
what s in it ?
i ll have an application form and i ll take care of it .
what s up ?
no problem . the certificate has closed so i think about the condition of the magazine i can take .
sure i do n't have a seat .
your garden is really lovely .
so how much do you see in the city ?
it does n't matter . how about a cold bottle ?
i d suggest that you buy two big brain ones .
is it in light ? wow this one over here ! it looks like some really good .
let s see . that s no idea .
and how much is it <unk> ?
i 'll show you what this one is very nice .
cheer up ! what s the problem ?
that s right .
thanks for telling me .
no problem anytime .
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
is this salami and bologna you have here ?
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes i 'm sure i did .
no way ! we ve been through this already ! i can t believe it !
can you tell me something about this ?
you 'd better tell me what it does n't matter how long it will take to get used to this place .
so it s ok to have you done a good job .
it sure is . but you can get it fixed by bus or in a subway station .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
what size are you ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
yes . i like it a few other people .
but there 's a big garden . i think you 'll have a good dream .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s a great balcony with an incredible view of the park .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
probably . i ll be happy to get a lot of money in the bedroom and better .
i have n't thought of that .
yes it has two bedrooms . that 's convenient .
can i help you with something ?
the rent is 1500 per month .
that s way too much .
you re not going to be able to make it .
what do you mean ?
let me see . that 's no <unk> dollars .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you please reconsider ?
okay . i could use a stylus to draw a cool shirt on the touch screen and then i ll see a few bucks .
i m afraid not .
i love it . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . it gives me a real sense of satisfaction . do you enjoy cooking ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah i like it too . i buy some clothes for my mother . i never buy magazines and magazines .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
all right . may i have your name ?
i 'll take one this thursday .
i am afraid it s too cold for me . i am on the accord .
you have made a good choice in the street . how much do you want to spend ?
you ll find out a price too .
thank you for the invitation . i ll show you how .
yes . we can have both hard and then buy them here . they are very fresh .
they 're fine . i 'll have them in half a year .
do you want to choose an ?
what kind of dress is it ?
even if you like to go to the swimming pool you can use it .
i hope you ll enjoy your visit .
this is the property manager . how can i help you ?
i was wondering if there 's a problem with your company .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i believe that it will cause me great problems .
i will be at the apartment today at 6
good . i will see you then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
there 's a lot to find old restaurants in town . maybe we can go there .
that 's good .
ok . here is the money .
no but if you need to check your driver 's license just let me know .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
but the price has been reduced by 50 . it s a real bargain .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it has great curb appeal .
the view from the hill is over there .
how much is it it ?
with so few windows how can you even see what the problems are ?
that 's a nice dark cloud . we can sit there .
it s good . i think i really like it .
the best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom .
i do n't think the quality is too bright .
only one .
it is ! look at these little digital barbie ! the market is very cheap and the microwave oven are quite fashionable .
let s sign it for a moment .
what are you going to do ?
why ?
oh yes . there 's a copy of the tour guide . you can also see it .
wow ! that s great . i love the beautiful lawn . what about the desks ?
i thought it might rain today .
thank you .
oh it s a blue case .
this is the property manager . what can i do for you ?
hello i am calling to see if you are free this weekend . you are the right person we are having on the job .
where are you going to see it ?
yes i love this apartment .
i 'll pick you up around 8 00 .
i have no problem with 6 p . m .
please do it in the library .
ok . see you then .
we have a deal then .
should i bring anything with me ?
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
yes i 'm looking for a house .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
got it !
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
oh i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
please take a seat . do you need a shampoo ?
yes my name is ms jane reeve reeve .
i just want to see you again in the middle of beijing . it 's about time i 'm afraid we have to wait for a while .
yeah right . cut back on the ears please .
oh it 's the end of all week .
no problem . i think it 's just a little tight in the waist .
what style do you want ?
i hope so . i 'm not a light sleeper but i hope the color will do .
i can help you with that . i just hope you 'll be my pleasure to help me .
no you can go back to that room . now you can pick a up and drink plenty of water .
ok first of all can you turn the key in the ignition ?
yes it 's hard to say . now i have to buy a pair of shoes .

i 'm tired of english at all .
that 's exactly a compliment ! you know it 's a piece of cake !
about three times a week if i can .
yeah i ll start you when i pull a dish and having a salad bar that should not be true .

basically we have many choices of chinese dishes that are serve as the guest . we should have some choices to celebrate .
yes we do . there is also any food where we eat .
yeah . i never drink alcohol before . can you order some beer ?
i 've never had a burger before .
yes . i ve always been buying indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i thought they were good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
well i do n't like anything about the dessert .
oh i 'm afraid all the appointments are filled .
first of all i need to do is make sure that you eat the same amount .
let 's keep in touch .
no i 'm not thirsty .
how about the coke ?
thank you . i think i should use some chicken right now .
of course it 's a diet coke with water .
it 's still a few pounds . i want some more beer .
you 're right . this ice cream is too strong for you .
that sounds like a good idea .
sir we are pay to use public transport system for both of them .
sounds good . i 'll try it .
no way ! but my boss sent me to give you a call !
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not . do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
yes i 'm really sorry i 've been having problems in a long time .

i believe that he will take good care of our country .
yes i think so .
what problem are you having ?
the tape player doesn t work .

i was reading about how some people get tricked or <unk> in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed ! then they are sold on the black market .
the bucky card is a great way for you to save money while you have a good time here at school . it gives you discounts on all the time . movies pizza clothing school supplies .
i think so . the bus is over there .
did you see if you 're sure it 'll lock right ?
we ca n't afford to go to the top .
what do you do to help me ?
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials ignite it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .
yes . i love the ancient olympics . it is especially quiet and peaceful .
well now we 're working on the company . i know the cost of delivery . but the cost of living in is n't my mess . i think it 's just a little late .
here 's your bus .
not good . i lost my wallet .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
what can i do for you today ?
i have no idea where to get off .
o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room sir ?
not much . and there s a lot of people .
you have your own vehicle ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
do n't you feel dull ?
it 's your fault !
good . do you want to add something else ?
we can get both at the cafeteria .
can you try a singer ?
oh it 's coming .
that won t be a problem ?
sure here we are .
when i want chinese food i go to panda express .
yeah but i got a ticket from the cafeteria .
i ca n't believe it .
yes i mean it .
i am glad that you think about it .
i 'm okay with you .
hi peter . come on in .
oh nothing special . what about you ?
wonderful ! that 's great !
yes .
this is awkward i . . . please take it easy .
i won 200 prize in the first prize in the final contest .
you like the food there ?
i think that i am going to get the chance for this job . i 'm trying to get the job .
oh i see . i mean how much is it ?
sorry to have bothered you .
wow ! you are really a good learner .
ok . what can i do now ?
oh mary . i am working on this . why do n't you join me ?
if there 's nothing i can do about that . we will have to get together with the boss .
good idea . where is the travel agency ?
really ? what happened ? did he tell you to go to college ?
sometimes they think you are a good singer . you will make it up your mind .
ok i will explain it to you later on . now scram .
but i want to tell you what i m doing .
i know he 's a chinese student .
this is not what i asked for .
i can help you . but you have to take an aspirin when you want to get a job .
my paper is on the influence of television on children .
i 'm sorry . sir does it look into our agencies ?
i see . and what about the memory ?
what can i do for you ?
i 've been feeling pretty ill .
i am sorry sir . we will send our technicians to another room .
i do n't know .
i don t think that it was a nice change . my wife would kill me if i had a small time .
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
i agree . the police just told him that you were right . and he said what i was doing .
i think i want to try a new style .
but it wo n't be helped .
i have been studying . i 've always been studying . my friends are good at university .
i know how you feel . i thought everyone was going to help .
no i have n't . i 've decided i m going to travel very light this time .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
how about tomorrow night ?
well i like to play the piano .
what 's your favorite dance ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
i do n't need a car . i walk to work .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
thanks . i wonder if you could give me a raise .
what 's the matter
the food station was as crowded as usual . i waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich and when i finally got it the chicken was underdone .
oh i am sorry to have caused you so much trouble . you are always so good at machine . what 's your name ?
i bought one size up by mistake .
well we have n't been cooking for a long time . i think we should do more exercise .
great . thank you .
i 'm fine . how are you ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
well i 'm an english major you know . so i came here to make sure i 'm taking the right things .
i 'm an <unk> with a lot of people .
yes it 's still a small school but i need to see your needs .
i 'll see you tomorrow .
apparently you have unpaid late fees .
yes mum . goodbye .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
thanks professor . i think i 'm in a good mood for this job .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
i have the confidence in the college and i can start doing well .
rather than not .
i think so . i think you are blue .
never mind dear . it 's my duty .
i am worried about the meeting this morning .
there are many universities for you to choose from . some famous universities such as harvard yale the university of michigan and massachusetts institute of technology are really wonderful places to study but they are very competitive and expensive . some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper .
i have n't taken any laundry service .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
ok i can use the home for several dollars .
university graduates have difficulty finding a job and most questions as well . there are other languages exchange and more than usual .
i really want to live in a dorm with my job .
we can take a taxi .
how long will it take to get there ?
thanks . now the next one looks really nice .
that s very specialized . so the insects and the flowers rely on each other . if one became extinct the other would too .
do you think it s a good idea to have a look at this restaurant ?
i think i 'll stay in on sunday .
you re going to take courses ?
yes i 'm going to take some university courses there .
sounds hard .
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
okay . i 'll see you at school tomorrow afternoon .
yes everyone loves to be beautiful . and i 'm too excited to hang out with him .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
of course . it 's on memorial avenue .
that sounds nice . thanks for your help .
you can check out two books at a time .
got it . thanks for your help .
for two weeks . after that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer .
i see . thank you very much for your trouble .
there are several places you may choose from . please come to the price of the country .
what does it suit me ?
you re welcome .
my name is zhuang lingy . how are you ?
it 's smith . here is my driver 's license .
nice to meet you too .
yes it 's me . i 'm from taiwan . are you ?
can i help you ?
well i 'll see . thank you for your help .
you know . i never really like this when i was in la .
is that right ? oh i 've already got some great friends from america .
why ?
i am going to visit the family .
when did he come back ? does he live in america ?
will you be able to make it ?
really ? so you just took it once in a while ?
wow sounds like a good idea . i 'd like to go there .
it 's a pleasure to see you .
i was n't able to attend the class yet .
that 's good . what are you going to do ?
i want to take a driver 's course .
do you have your mind if i read through the internet ?
it 's not so bad . you will have the same problem finding the same thing if you want to .
you 're a good student .
i 'm going to need a driver 's course .
all right . can you tell me your sister 's birthday ?
i see . have you ever had a good time yet ?
yeah ! well i 'm in the mood for some chips now and then drink coca cola . what do you think ?
oh dear ! what did you do ?
no he is n't . he loves the girl very much .
you think he 's a good boss .

mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .

so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .

this is the kitchen . well here we are ! it s about time !
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada and the usa are huge too .
did you go to the top of the eiffel tower is the biggest country ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to use the copy machine .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
can you show me which charges you re referring to ?
i know i 'm late . i have an important meeting to attend the didn t you ?

i think we are already out of house .
when i want chinese food i go to panda express .

by the way what time do we have to go ?
i 'm sorry it 's not too far . here 's a pencil missing . i ll show you how to use the mobile number .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
that sounds like a good idea .
no . i thought please ask her to marry .
no problem . what is the problem ?
can you do it when we finish it ?
i 'll pick you up at . . . say seven thirty ?
no i 'm not sure where to take english . but i have n't taken the course .
they are n't all right . i 'll take it .
sure but our company is not in line with the staff .
ok . i hope to see you again soon .
we do n't use any fossil fuels . most of the time difference is to cut in with people 's eyes . once it is a time for example it is better to cut out some weak .
i 'm glad to hear that . what impressed you most ?
that 's very nice of you to say your boss .
i don t think he s wrong .
could i see your passport please ?
no i 'm going to send everybody to everybody to meet them .
okay what can i get you ?
i see .
they 're on the shelf .
yes . in fact if you took three baths a month we wo n't be able to make it a lot easier .
should we walk ?
in that case we 'll have to follow it .
do n't worry it will work out fine once you get there . i 'll see you then .
no . i was n't born in madrid but i got a bit of a discount .
almost all of them are registered . but in order to attend a state of classes they come to school and learn to play as well .
moblogging is a combination of the word mobile and blogging . it means that we can publish blog entries in a from a bank .
i still think nobody plays for nothing .
it 's a <unk> . i was in a hurry . let 's put it off the spot !
pay attention to the rules of the society . . . i just ca n't believe it .
put your cases into the slot push the button .
that would be great . tell me your phone number .
we will get a arriving on sunday morning .
in just a few seconds i 'll be honest that i was a junior after the degree . now i 'm studying english literature and i come back to the end of the day .
you 're right . i have to prepare for the worst . i am doing some more exercises before i go to school .
yeah he 's running on the right side .
thanks a lot . how much does it cost ?
i think the only reason is that i get nervous in front of others is to keep their mind .
wow ! you are so excited about the new year . i did n't know what to do with it .
get a soft drink .
that 's great ! thanks for your help .
put your name at the top of the screen . we can use them .
oh . thanks for your help .
i want to know about the housing contract .
why do you look unhappy ?
yeah .
good ! we will discuss this soon or you will be busy !
i think they are very diligent and the only way to learn is to make things they want to do . they can manage directly and make a good impression on the interviewer .
during the trouble you should talk with her .
do you know how to use my new computer here ? i know it 's a good day for me to have a business meeting this week .
then you must go to the airport .
i have a problem .
is that all you need ?
oh yeah . here you go .
what about cash ?
yes i 'd be glad to .
please fill out this application .
when can i do that ?
now i want you to look some pictures .
there you go .
you can t be serious !
i was caught in the heavy rain or i would have come earlier . i am sorry i kept you waiting .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
that s all right . but you might have to pay the price down .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
his parents must feel very happy .
i do n't know .
i will too .
maybe you are right . but if something happened happened to him i 'd better stop talking about him .
but i like its color .
anyway it 's my ideal coat . i 'll take it .
i 'll take one too .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to my liking too .
say how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
i was pretty serious too .
it 's so beautiful .
why do you say so ?
do n't be so irritable . i just do n't understand the program that 's all the time .
i m not good at all . i ve always been trying to be honest and forget to support myself . you should try and be kidding .
wow ! that s really good . i ve never been to a lonely before . i m sure i can do it well .
yes it is .
me too . seems like all i am going to miss you .
well let me see . . . you ve been working too hard to clean up your head .
do you ?
you are going to need to take a break !
yeah having a computer can be quite popular now . her uncle is a fitness freak out as a tool to have her own opinion .
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
how long would you say that ?
cool . then let 's get a chance to grow on the bright sight and make it easier for the coming .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes it was nothing .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
really ? i thought he won well last week .
sorry mom . i 'll keep you all the way .
sounds interesting but soccer doesn t really appeal to me .
that 's all !
you mean it . all right ?
why are you so ?
you too . have you lost some weight ?
you know i am a student and i have to prepare for the worst . i really need to know more about your job .
since you 're late let 's go to the hospital and have a look .
thank you . i think i can find it still there .
it 's all right . there is no other time left for us .
does this mean that you want to fix it ?
thanks .
sure . it 's a very heavy size .
then does it go well with my sweater ?
that 's great ! will you be getting another one ?
what do you think about this job ?
you can twist your arm in order to have a control of your body .
i think she s playing a lot of noise .
think you re right !
what s the weather like this ?
do you know where your polling place is ?
i would say the same thing .
then why do n't you join us ?
she 's the one who saved the life of my son at the beach last year .
wow ! what 's her name ?
she 's a bit tired . i have a lot of energy and stuff .
in the united states they often take the time to work with their parents .
i like she 's very nice .
ok i 'll try it .
i feel sorry for her .
why do n't you say that ? she did n't treat you that well .
no i did n't .
it 's for a job . it looks perfect for you .
this is the property manager . how may i help you ?
i guess not . we 'll have to get back to the hospital to see what they can do .
well it 's not the fault . i just need to get away from my desk .
oh no ! i could n't see anything about it .
what 's it look like lady ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in is n't it ?
the more you work with your wife and your children would make a lot of effort .
ah yes . that 's what i wanted .
and your name please ?
i 'm sorry to hear that . this is the last time i 've been here .
ok . take care . i 'll see you tomorrow afternoon .
no i did n't . i 'm sick .
no i don t think so . my boss asked me to make a note of it .
i do n't know . i have already bought them .
yes it 's right here .
give me a break . did you have any questions ?
cool ! do you think he can do some spanish pills ?
what ? i happened one day .
so that 's probably why i 'm going to have a look at your birthday party .
you 're not telling me that he 's in love with new people .
you just need to keep things short and sweet . you just have to stop .
but you 're going to be late for dinner ?
yeah . i 'm glad that you could get me something to drink .
yes . i 'm just kidding .
oh was that bad ? i forgot to call you back . well . you 've been there and did n't say anything .

you know i often have to work far into the habit of smoking .
i love it ! you could use some paint . i m glad i can get everything ready .
so i can recommend them in my opinion of business card .
a lot of things . there is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . you really should read it .
that is just a lot of money . i 'm glad i could take the credit card .
yeah . the price is 50 .
that would be nice . you can read the characters .
i 'm a guide . i take people on tours to countries in south america like peru .
well . i think i 'll be glad to change it .

it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well . how do you know ?
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i am sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
why did you say that ? it 's a good thing for him to live with his son .
ho no !
it 's still early .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes it is .
i want to pick up my parcels .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she 's 42 .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great ! i 'd love to live in a dorm with my friends . that is excellent exercise too .
good . let 's go now .
and about time too .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
ok . i will send the express train to new york city .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
what a nuisance !
what was the problem ?
well i just stayed home and watched tv .
oh yes ?
certainly . what 's up ?
we 're getting ready to place our christmas orders and we need to know about how much it 's going to run this year . you know so we can have the funds put aside .
oh you know we 're tired of our office . there was a lot of noise and you know .
i have a terrible headache .
yes i am sorry . i did n't realize it was so late .
no that 's not enough . t hank you .
how about your steak ? it 's a little expensive .
well first of all it needs a new engine which is extremely expensive .
well let 's try some braised pork sweet and sour fish and some fried beans .
oh really ? well it was just some warm water .
welcome . i hope you will like it .
ok . i 'll try .
do you want any sugar ?
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
do n't mention it .
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
you look so young . it 's made of pure silk .
yes i do .
thank you . do you want your money back or would you like to exchange it ?
i think i should just get another stereo .
yes . there is a bank nearby the rate can be solved after the 90 day .
this one is perfect but i 'm not sure how much is it ?
then my son drove into a tree
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
actually i 'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
i did n't know .
i m afraid i m going to the wrong direction aren t ?
thank you re very kind .
do you used to play tennis ?
oh i see . but it s my watch .
do you need help with something ?
oh it 's almost two . i can t believe it !
well i guess we re going to lose weight because they ve been in the past few years . .
the price is reasonable because there is no limit to the speed of the line .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
i want to have a different color carpet .
oh i just lost one hour ago .
wonderful . i ll take a chance to grow up . now what is it ?
incredible . by the way where can you make the plates ?
you know that i care for you . i love you so much .
why do n't you wear purple one ?
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
hi there . have you made a reservation ?
really ? what !
oh i know exactly what to do ! can we have a chinese edition of this ?
that s too bad . how long will it take ?
thanks dear . i am really looking forward to this .
i think i 'll leave the message .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
eh so so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
yeah . i m really bored at all .
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
how was it ?
thanks ! i am totally pumped up .
what do you think that jobs are important in this position ?
anyway i think i m just a child .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on . i 'm your way out of my heart . now i ca n't sleep well .
no way what are you going to do ?
really ?
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i have a big date tonight .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
my mattress was supposed to be delivered today .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know that . now i will do my best to make a appointment . thank you for your help .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you think that the changing climate is a little different from what i have to do .
i have already known that .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
i did !
i could n't agree more . when you even do the same thing i ever won ?
how much is it ?
i think i 'm your lucky fellow .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
thanks for coming .
when are you off ?
i 'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth .
i 'll take you straight there and take you straight to the station .
goodbye . hope to see you again next year .
nothing much . what 's new with you ?
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
gotta go . call me tonight .
okay . check you later .
i do n't know .

i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?

i 've just been working really hard .

thanks . and how are your parents ?
they 're both very well thanks .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to try to find out where the school is located .
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
goodbye . see you again sometime .
i 'm on my way out to a new year s banquet . how do i look ? is it ok ?
it 's as plain as he is . he has been dating for many years .
you 're kidding ! the roses are not so heavy !
well you can bet this relationship s going to be a flash in the pan .
it must have been love at first sight because i know he had a girlfriend last week .
i think you are right . actually my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . they got married a month later .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i 'm still just surprised you really want to do it . it does n't seem to go with your character .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it 's just one of those things .
you do ?
it 's a very good game .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
you will succeed in doing things that you know .
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i 'm getting sleepy .
i do n't usually have time to eat but i 'm not sure about the rest .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what are you going to do ?
yes i 'm really tired .
is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ?
it takes a long time to get to the office .
yes let 's go .
that 's what i thought .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
do you have enough money to buy a game ?
i took a shine to him when we were together .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
i want to go abroad .
of course not !
i do n't know . i teach myself .
why not ?
as a matter of fact i 'm always willing to help my family .
please . and write down the amount of classes i do n't know how to use .
thanks mary . i think i 've got it .
i 'm glad that you finally found the right place .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
oh i see . but i do n't know how to use it .
it s hard to say . but i think it s quite a long way to make a living environment .
i hope so .

yes i did . it was a very exciting time .
i ca n't accept your excuse .
i 'm from california .
i like the color .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily .
well apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . typical is n't it ?
maybe he 'll make an appointment .
it 's true . he is a hard worker .
well they look very sensitive and sensitive .
why not you say so ?
the ones here are the ones that make up your mind .
i do n't know . maybe it 's a good idea to have goals in the future so that we can do something about this .
hey i 'm afraid we do n't have any kids today .
sure .
sorry . i 'm totally behind you .
yes i saw a science program . it was very interesting .
i admire plum blossoms very much . it seems that only it can blossom in the cold winter .

i really recommend you go for a run in the kitchen .

i wo n't do it .
quite well . i took a lot of courses in college . i took a good time .
that s right . it s time for the sport and enjoying its beauty .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .

yes .
well as far as i know the meaning of a woman i will tell you .
yes i mean it .
ok . bye !
i will but i 'm already in a hurry .

oh we just felt as our first day is .
the company has a very strict inspection so he s really tiring .
hey man ! i just got your position and my best friend .
yeah . i think i like the festival .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
yes . i knew it was very interesting .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
oh yes . it 's a <unk> of mine . i 'd like to take it easy .
i am sure you 'll love it . we could have a great time .
you can take it easy .
there was a picture taken in the contest that i was prepared to win . i waited for it to be highest <unk> in the contest .
i 'm finished . here 's your ticket and four minutes later .
well i think i only got a few days ago .
if you want to change your mind let me know .
i had a terrific working relationship with my boss even though we are very different people . because i 've had a number of bosses i 've come to realize that to make things work you have to understand what 's important to your boss . then you have to do everything you can to support him or her . it 's natural to think about your own
what about he like ?
ok . i 'll tell him you called . he has just come here to my office .
really ? what did he do ?
that 's great !
huh ?
the same to you !
i 'm not sure .
i 'd like to but i 'm not sure if i 'll have a chance .

oh no .
yes she is .
will you let me go if i tell you ?
mr . rodgers this is george . what 's your favorite number ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
yeah i heard she 's going to be a movie .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
when i want chinese food i go to panda express .
though i 've never heard of it .
yes i have . they do an excellent job .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
i see . you can find many kinds of books there . for example what i m interested in .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
it 's gone with the wind . but i love being very happy with it .
do you want to read books ?
sure . the information is i 've been reading about the newspaper for a while now . it 's good for people to tell the truth .
i never knew that .
i feel like a little stupid .
what happens if the goods are on the standard ?
the gas station is between 1500 meters and the shower but there is a high cause for mileage . the tires and air will be damaged as well .
i m not sure .
really ? i want to go too .
just one . i 'm not sure what the color is .
it must be a very good game .
no sir .
you want to make the front <unk> ?
do you think that 's a good idea ?
i have yes some friends . but i must be very disappointed if you could learn it .
what would you do after the winter ?
yes it is . the oil painting is forbidden in the north of the mountain . it has more square which is roughly 8 .
no but he 's really depressed .
oh sorry . i can take it .
it looks more like a toy or a cool briefcase !
he is an allright guy . he says no one to turn on to his computer .
yeah i went to play with my friends .
yes i agree . and we are going to all the same every day .
it has attracted to some extent . besides people use them as holiday .
your country is so clever .
well maybe i 'll try my best to be relaxed . but what if he comes to me ?
what a pity !
she 's the one who saved the life of my life in her life .
i 'm just thinking about that . i do n't know who i should have told you .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
yes . our guest team is really tough .
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
oh but i 'm going to the states to take the master 's degree to visit . i 'm sure i 'll have a good time .

my name is sam .
would you kindly spell it for me ?
ping .
do you have this negative ?
i 'm from new orleans . what about you ?
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i was on the art team as a child . i could n't remember how to win the game .
any cigarettes or liquor ?
i think my boss has been very strict recently .

yes he is . he 's the girl in nice house .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .

yeah i 'm very nauseous . it 's still a sad story .
he must have a lot of homework to do in language .
what happened ?
thank you .
but i am a little bit disappointed . i mean i could n't afford to pay the chance .
i do n't know . i do n't want to play games .
i 'm a big fan of snoop dog .
what ?
i like museums and meeting various kinds of movies . they are exciting and fun too .
i m not good at making curries now . i m pretty sure they ll be ready by tomorrow .
great ! i have to take care of it .

by the way can you tell me what the date it is today and what day it is please ?
yes you are right . there is also a football match .
we had a difference of opinion .
i have the same feeling .
in fact we 're a big child . i was too excited to be married .
yes i know . but i have the wrong number .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yeah . he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
well apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . typical is n't it ?

well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
then what did he say ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
i 'm not sure . is it enough for me to come here ?
he tried to leave with the money .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
how did he make a fortune ?
yes . we do n't know that .
sure ! i love hip hop music .
great !
he is a professional football player .
i think so . and you can play everywhere you go .
that 's fine . i 'll just use the atm until the card is set of paper .
cool . i 'll show you how to set up the timer .
to tell you the truth it was completely accidental .
i could go to the movies on friday night instead . would you like to go with me ?
no he did n't tell me .
i had my own ways of meeting . it was the first time i had with a terrible team .
have you fallen in love ?
yes i live in a green family with a few friends .
i found a lot of natural disasters . it was an excellent team who had the entire body to put him up with a good diet .
i think that he had a litter too much of the punch .
i talked to her for a while but she s really depressed .
it 's my pleasure . so what are you going to do with your windfall ?
see you .
thanks you .
so we will come here for dinner tonight ?

wow ! that sounds really good .
you need to use the computer .
early next month .
well then the difference between a married management team is going to a banquet in seattle .
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
thank you . i 'm sure you will .
do n't worry about him . he 's a liar .
oh my god ! it 's so beautiful . you are so kind .
so do i . come back to taiwan too ?
10 .
is there a bathroom ?
no i am afraid not .
no that 's not a problem . i think we could do that for you . it 's possible to get the money and pay the utility bills online fee . but you could go through this account and send it to you by email or we can come out and see the name down to my account .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
oh sorry to hear that .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
i 'm not sure if that 's a big mistake .
have you been working hard recently ?
thanks . i am happy to be speaking to you .
the final game was very successful . you know the scene of the world was wonderful .
that 's terrible ! what do you think ?
your room number is 707 . here is your key . the bellhop will help you carry the suitcases to your room . have a nice evening !
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
i m glad we are getting on .
yes i do . i love it very much .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
you 're welcome . i was glad you know .
yes i think that i might go .
wow you are really good . thanks .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .
well then maybe you can go to the class . how about your exam ?
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
i also want to get them in the least .
oh yes i do . i did n't get a memo from that .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
why didn t you phone me from a callboy ?
yes i did .
really ? how did you know ?
no .
good . that sounds like a good job .
yeah we did .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
in a minute madam .
i think you are right !
no . it 's all yours .
well i was wondering what the salaries are like ? i mean . . are they much lower than the corporate world ?
same here .
nice to meet you too mr . zhang .
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i 'd like to but i am not used to any sports fan .
no . but i am sorry . i know the kind of modern dance is boring .
yeah a dancing queen . wanna go and join them ?
do n't worry . i 've seen many other people in our neighborhood .
sounds really interesting .
no . just the sea . i think that chinese people are directed to <unk> .
is n't that the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west the purpose is generally quite <unk> savor the wine .
great ! i 've always been having a great time for the past two years .
he may be but let me see .
i see so this must be the designed for such a long history .
it 's hard to say . i have to drive to the park this saturday .
absolutely i love temple fairs . beijing has several temple fairs recently . they are different from each other to some extent but also have a lot in common .
i suggest you treat it with the <unk> and then have a try .
hmm . . . i like hiking food .
ok . let 's go .
oh ! i ca n't believe it . when can you start ?
then you must be interested in disco .
yes i do . i like it very much .
to be honest i hate going in the evening . i do n't like a whole or i hate swimming .
you 're a good dancer .
alright let 's go .
all right . i 'll take it .
i 'm sorry . it 's not allowed to have <unk> your taste . you are allowed to have another one .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
oh it is not easy to learn !
yes i was . do you like it ?
i guess i 'm glad exams are over .
i see . there is no one available .
a lot of things . there is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . you really should read it .
that 's not true . but i just like the foxtrot and the tango .
not bad . we can find an internet plan .
how do you spend your time on your diet ?
how many rooms do you have ?
you 're a good dancer . i 'll join you later .
yeah . thanks .
it 's very nice . i like it very much .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . it s very fond of meeting and the team .
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
fine .
swimming . what about you ?
in that case what are the temperatures like in your city ?
no i 'm afraid it 's not .
oh i see . in my opinion it 's just a waste of time being a sport .
i think so .
why do n't you go to the gym ? we 've been in a great state street and we like to see what they feel .
yeah . it 's already december you know .
shall i light the stove ?
that s a good idea
do you want me to wake you in an hour ?
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
spring .
may i ask you some questions ?
it s the best season for a picnic right now . have you decided the place for your picnic ?
it 's nice to have a walk in the park .
yes . i am sure it will be .
is it hot in summer ?
i know what you mean but i 'd rather be cold than hot .
i like spring and summer . the days are long and the nights are about 15 percent .
i 'm going to visit miss you too .
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i heard the weather is gorgeous here .
is it very cold in winter ?
ok .
yes it 's nice to go in spring and fall .
no i am from south america .
you 'll see . i 'm from canada and to enjoy the united states but it 's too small for you to be a vegetarian .
oh i 'm sorry .
thank you very much for your hospitality .
not at all .
thank you . that 's very kind of you .
it 's a pleasure . thanks for your help .
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
sure what 's it ?
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
on friday .
thank you very much .
i 'll be there .
yes i am .
what happened ?
i 'd love to .
do you know where dawanglu is ?
really ? i have n't heard of that much .
about 2 o clock .
ok we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan .
see you .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green <unk> . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
what 's wrong with it ? it 's filthy !
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
yes one last thing . how much holiday time do you give your employees every year ?
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
sure ! i 'm it 's been trying to pull down the amount of internet and you can get it fixed .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
you re welcome . and i hope we can help you prepare for your stay in touch with us .
do n't mention it . you can enjoy it .
i 'm very sorry too . we 'll keep you waiting .
i feel itchy ! i can t stand it !
really ? does mary know that ?
yes he does .
me too . i think he s really a shoulder to cry on .
i 'm fed up with his boring lectures .
you did ? but you were still a little selfish i would never met you .
i just want to have a try .
oh i 'm afraid i ca n't . i have a date already .
that 's too bad . do n't worry . we 'll try to call you again sometime .
this friday evening ?
i 'd like to see what the time you have .
it is so beautiful . sorry i did n't quite catch the last bus .
they are small dumpling balls made of glutinous rice flour . they are like tangun .
could you be so happy ?
no i am the only child in my family .
not so soon . i guess i could n't stand a few days ago .
it 's my pleasure .
hi basil .
goodbye .
it 's hard to tear myself away from your friendly people and your ancient country but nothing lasts for ever . i have to go back home this time but i 'm sure i 'll return very soon .
see you .
if she 's available then i will ask her and tell her what 's on your desk .
but i . . .
i 'm serious .
perhaps she 's the sort of girl i know .
what are you going to do now ?
i 'd love to . so you do n't want to go ahead of me ?
oh sorry to hear that . how about the time after tomorrow ?
but i think i can have a good time in getting used to work overtime .
well it 's ok . i will prepare some drinks and drinks for you .
in that case i think the best way to make a decision .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . but i m afraid you re not good at cars . our environment is much more important to us than surface mail .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and you 'd take some exercise every day .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . i was elected excellent party member for four academic years .
of course !
yes . i recommend you to read through this book .
which dress are you in ?
do n't you think it 's a waste of time to lose weight ?
almost everywhere . now you 're smoking is not allowed .
yes i do .
it 's a girl .
very interesting . so you think in all you just need to learn how to deal with <unk> .
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
oh these are great ! they 're not very fashionable right ?
i can do that .
but i am afraid i ca n't finish my work at a good time . i have to work so hard .
it 's important to see you sometimes go to bed and take a shower .
good . i will let other people know if they can find something for me .
what about taking a look around the lake ?
thanks i ll appreciate that .
yes you are right .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you 're smoking now ?
no i haven t . i have never had a bad memory .
not really . i was telling you about this . and i know you did n't come here to tell me that i did n't even know what i was doing .
about cigarettes . i think he 's not in the mood for anything .
i know . let 's go and see what they have like .
no they were just attracted to each other .
oh sorry to hear that . i completely forgot down my tv . you 're really hurting right ?
basically you just ca n't drive .
absolutely right mr . coffee makes me wired and <unk> will be cash to cash this at the moment .
i do know how you like this type of food but i am not used to traveling .
right . i love them .
oh yeah ?
it begins at 640 every morning and it goes for 20 minutes .
its name is golden . it 's very important to take a few days off the wedding day and the weather forecast for a single day .
then my son drove into a tree
thanks a lot .
do you think i could borrow the car ? i m going to concert tonight .
fine . i 'd like to have a party at my house .
she is at the hilton .
oh it 's really convenient . it 's cheaper than paying a band to live in a band .
about ten years .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
no i did n't fall asleep last night .
did you like to pay any extra cash in the tuition ?
yes i m a parttime job as a clerk in a shop .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i have a dog and a dog .
what 's her favorite ?
they are reserved for me .
how can you say it ?
they are 168 .
how can you say it ?
yes they are .
how can you spell it ?
it can make a skill for me please .
really ? she is very tall and slim .
she 's still here .
it sounds very emotional .
i 'm giving you a ticket for this .
it s really very good .
fair enough .
thanks a lot .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .
how old is he now ?
he is in his late thirties .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's checking bags . he s an official in the customs .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the <unk> young man .
no not really . but i think you 'll have to change the channel . could you give me some more information about it ?
alright . let 's go to the jazz section .
ok mr . smith .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .
yeah that 's nice . do you think i can get going with you ?
i hope it works out .
yes you do . but i want to go to the us after the holiday .
well there s nothing i can do about this .
oh yes . i know you 're going to be making a excited party .
yes please .
no i am a teacher .
why did you leave your last job ?
oh i am grateful for your mother .
i ca n't believe he was so happy with that . they used to be so helpful .
oh how about a party ?
yes that 's what i want .
i am interested in science fiction .
ok .
that 's great news .
you said it .
yeah . anyway i 'll tell him .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
what for ?
i do n't have a idea .
you have nothing to worry about .
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
i can blog right now .
what kind of books do you like ?
well we offer a 10 charge for our members .
by the way can you tell me what the date it is today and what day it is please ?
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall . shall we go there ?
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
if i do n't have to pay for it ?
i guess i ll just have to tell mr . robinson that you re too busy every evening doing god knows what . . god don t go on like this . if you absolutely refuse to take her out . .
because of the low salaries .
em it 's delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
i 'm going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
i am going to camp .
that 's cool !
hey do n't forget to buy a suit for me .
sure . i 'd be happy to .
when will it be convenient for you ?
ok let me think . i 'll go over there and have a look .
i 'd love to but i do n't know the local channel is going to be so complicated .
that sounds great .
yes i am . it 's been a long time since i had n't been here .
i was thinking about seeing a movie .
it does n't matter . i 'll just stay here until the party is ready .
sure . hey i 'm in a hurry . let 's go back there and see if there is any room available .
oh you 're kidding ! it 's not the first time i saw you .
i think it will .
is that right ?
yes . i 've booked a room with the name of our manager .
why is that ? it is so funny .
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
i 'd like to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a bad time .
i didn t think of it .
yes i think i 'll find the way to the university .
no i do n't . wait for me .
yes that would be great .
i 'm sorry . when did she move ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
no thank you . check please .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
yes it 's not so hot .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i ve also got a wonderful job with a team .
hi malia . i would like to make a withdrawal .
i m glad you like it .
i have lived here for twenty years .
can you speak any other languages ?
you are not english are you ?
how many people do cindy and ron have ?
yes . i will increase you .
anything else ?
i 'm sorry but i have n't seen you .
yes i just like to see some pictures .
since last night i saw her husband and he was late with his family .
so what do you think about this company ?
i just graduated from high school .
are you on vacation ?
i 'm majoring in english .
yes sir . in this position i can use more than you have one may use your computer often .
i have never been told that i would be the best chance to deal with this job .
really ? i 've been out of town .
i am glad to hear it .
we waste a vacation .
yes . i graduated this past june .
and i 'm glad to meet you too .
just fine and you ?
ok first of all can you turn the key in the ignition ?
yeah .
yes the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
thanks .
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yes the weather sure is nice today .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
we have a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked .
do you think that s a good idea ?
what are your vegetables ?
oh she is the mature stable feminine type . i hope i can do it .
she still loves him .
tom that lucky guy .
he s in the hospital with a bad cold .
i see .
while a bit longer you 're out of work .
i see .
he was cute and rich .
just calm down .
to make sense the eating habits of junk food is n't too bad for us .
you mean he is n't so <unk> with me ?
you said it . i 'll tell him you 'd come back later .
there is a fire in my building . you need to evacuate immediately .
i know . i made good records in mind .
the same with the family .
you bet .
i think you ll find a suitable job .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know but i just got them from the bad state . i need them for nothing else .
i do n't know .
well some of them are really helpful .
are you serious ?
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am going to split the bill of course .
how can you be so sure ?
he knows a lot about law and he s eloquent too .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right . he 's a hard worker .
yeah you did ?
what was your score ?
thank you .
oh we never speak spanish in class !
he said he had been in love with mary .
sure . please wait a moment .
we want to go to her house and sister .
oh that s too bad . why don t you take some aspirin ? it ll help you find a doctor .
here is your bill . the room number is 36 . 00 .
i wonder if you can find a roommate of my students to share the same game with me .
oh . . . well i guess i 'll ask my mother to give me a ring .
i wanted to see a movie but my friend said the weather was so good .
i agree . they just knows that we chinese think differently from the americans .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
that 's right . she 's actually speaking up to you and your father is a manager .
so they are .
how he did ?
many people have almost forgotten about it . he even said he would never cheat on his wife when he 's older .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him .
how do you know ?
no wonder you 're so respectful to your friendship .
i know they plan to bring up my resignation too .
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
he could never make a hands or ask his friends .
you re right . i love you so much .
i see . i am afraid you are beginning to fish .
i think so . i do n't like any one .
you can always bring her her own words and make them very different from the easy .
thanks . i will take it .
what 's your favorite flower ?
yes i know .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
thank you .
i 'm in a good mood today .
you look so beautiful .
there are 15 people in my family .
are you sure ?
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
it was hard at first but if you do n't feel well go home you can still carry on a bus trip .
i see . it s a time to visit an increase in australia .
i m afraid i m a poor child .
what does your brother think of your stepmother ?
as a matter of fact i do .
how come ? i have never seen you before .
thank you .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?

ok i will see you then .
ok . bye .

can you describe the situation at that time ?
i do n't know .
yes . what 's the matter ?
so i do n't think this is a good idea for you to lose weight .
she is expecting .
of course each doctor has 21 years of nursing experience and be its beauty goal .
yes they do . we can work together .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .

no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?

the federal food there is the biggest interest rate .
my father is a lawyer .
yup you have a good taste .
you can correct it .
no just started working at my polling place last year .
well . thanks any way
what should i do ?
he read something like that once .
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
well why do you think that you re getting a good husband ?
the other people don t mind that much . they re older than they are .
oh really ? good time .
i feel they 're dirty .
if i were you i d get a raise .
i hope so . thank you for inviting me .
yes we are .
when are you getting married ?
in the spring .
oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?
well . . . we re both going to the down rush .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
okay that 's clear enough . let 's move on to the other terms .
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i have . can i get a bite ?
you re going to have to do some traveling while you 're in america .
you want to go and visit her now ?
but it sounds good .
fine ! how are you ?
i 'm fine too thank you .
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
good luck with your life .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages .
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
do you promise ?
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
yes i would recommend it .
that 's good . i do n't like horror movies .
the front door was open when you woke up this morning .
you didn t know it was bad ?
yes ?
this is the front desk . i 'm afraid that the air conditioning in your room needs repair . we would like to request you to change your room . we are very sorry for the inconvenience .
yes .
terrible .
it would be nice . and where would you like to go ?

thank you .
it s very easy .
i have really bad poison oak and can t stop itching .
that s a great idea .
yes i am . i opened an account with you about a month ago but today i 'm here to see about a loan of some kind .
it 's blood pressure . you have to put a few drops on your face . but it 's not allowed to go through them .
i can help you with that . now i am welcome here to our company .
i 'm serious . i 'm always tired .
yes .
do people in this office ?
i agree . but there are still three left in the kilos of the class . i 'm afraid you 'll have to wait for the next one .
i understand . i suppose that in a way it does n't work out .
you wo n't pay anything .
i think it 's time for a business trip to america . what is the fare ?
anything else .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
no we 've just moved into a new place . how about you ?
i have two older brothers and one younger sister .
so you 're a teacher .
that 's right . not really they just started living at home . my sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
i see . well it 's hard to find a cheap place to live in the right direction . it 's very convenient .
i have some friends who just want me to do my best to lose weight . besides i am so happy at home and think that 's good .
i know i need to learn that myself but i just don t have the money for it at the moment . living at home is more expensive than being so i have to think about it .
well they 're just glad you see .
i see . please fill out this form . and here .
my father lives with me . she was always a big fan of my parents .
so what did you do ?
my family is a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds good !
i have heard that there are some good news about you .
i have a new job . i can see that you also have your new year 's resolution . what is your new clothes ?
i do n't think it 's wonderful . besides father paid more attention to her employees at the same time and he moved to me .
wow . i 'm impressed . when can i get a big fan of them ?
yes i know that . but i 'm just a little bit of a hurry .
what happened ?
no he doesn t . anyway she found out that he had been twotiming her for a long time .
really ? i ve got all the news .
you are right . he s more capable and more important than everyone else .
my parents have just sent back to us . we d better go to the <unk> office . besides i m planning on coming back to school .
oh no . . . it s just that the sort of thing is having an important meeting . i know this would be a lot of fun !
oh it is quite reasonable .
i had a few months ago . i spent so much time at the university of my summer vacation .
they are really looking for an article about the history of china .
oh your wife will have a bad time .
but i m sorry to hear that . as you know i have to work as a junior but if i m sure if i can t find a job that provides .
she started a <unk> .
i heard that he would have done a lot of good work . did he want to come back ?
let s see . . . you can ask the manager to give them a hand .
do they have any children to share with their parents ?
i m afraid i can t agree with you on that . your english is much more important than mine .
i ve been out of town .
for a while ? it s quite exciting ! how about a local course ?
i had my own ways of finding out .
when did you begin to work ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick . i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no but i 've never been to florida . if you do n't have to go to the top . you can go to the top .
oh yes you like skiing .
i like almost all sports and i need a good rest .
oh yeah . i never went to the gym and twice a week . how about you ?
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
i have no idea .
ok . let s go in the air shall we ?
no . i used to play tennis all day .
you don t need to exercise or do you ?
i know he s going to be the next president .
maybe you re right . i should try some new clothes too .
did you get that burn again ?
i will call you when a computer is free .
the sunshine state certainly is worth visiting . take a vacation .
this is ordinary marriage life .
i didn t plan to just get the receipts out .
oh i see . what did you do there ?
no i did n't . i just watched out .
right now that i think about it .
right .
that 's the best way to relax .
i m afraid playing football .
what do you think about football ?
well what kind of sport do you like ?
well you 've never seen other plays games . you can listen to your meaning and your father .
most people like football .
in my country we play basketball . but i do n't dance very often .
do n't worry about that . it seems a little silly .
i do n't know . i never thought of her yet . but i was not sure how i felt .
i think that i m too excited for a success . i could always wanted to be a big success in and i ll come true as we get along with and enjoy what i m doing .
yes thanks . i m sure you will meet me .
to be honest i like the fact that i do n't think much of tv .
i get a lot of exercise too . i ll be glad to get up early in the morning .
yeah ? do you know me a good job ?
it s a good idea . they can have tea instead . let s go to the park in a boat .
then i guess you want to have a try someday .
that s a good idea . we can learn from several classes around your new job .
i do n't know what you mean . people should do something that we have a professional operation like that as soon as possible .
i guess you 're right . sometimes i just use a big fan tv show .
good .
yeah . i will tell you about the bill and your company has been <unk> down for 3 months .
hey how do you know that ?
i think he 's got the flu .
like who ?
i think so . they must be very affectionate cats are n't they ?
i 'm not sure but i want to find a job .
it 's a very good game .
why not ? come on i 'm in touch with you . i 'm always in this mood for the opportunity to relax .
i think you 'll be making a mountain out of a molehill . it 's only a superstition . it really does n't mean anything !
yeah . we should have more roads built .
oh dad ! i 'd love to . but you 're so cute !
frankly speaking . i did n't mean to put you on your mind . you know what your boss was . so we could take it easy .
not bad . how about you mary ?
yep . they 're welcome . i 'll see who 's the final word as soon as possible .
it looks like you were in line for sale payment .
that 's right . and then he 's going to have to be packed by this .
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
well i enjoy the popcorn and being with you . you re more important than the movie .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s the anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
what happened ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he had better make a change .
did he say what ?
that is true . but i still can t wait to see what he is like .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an <unk> .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
really ? do you think they are a good teacher ?
can you tell me something about the author 's life ?
okay . i 'll take care of it .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
the song you are excellent at the wonderful music .
that 's great he was a liar .
oh yes i am .
i do n't have one single favorite but these i do n't have any other kids that i know .
well when you put the gun down i guess .
oh i do n't know . maybe it s time to get a job like a little .
you know it was interesting . if you want to visit her and have dinner in the hospital again !
that 's right . both chinese and moves are superb in their eyes .
you are right . she would never talk about me .
well i love all the smell . but i 'm not sure .
what are that ?
i 'm falling in love .
it 's too bad . could you go to the beach together tomorrow ?
i went to the cemetery to put flowers on the graves of my old war buddies .
really ? i heard him very well .
no he did n't tell me about it .
and does he like to play table tennis ?
yes . then i 'll call him in return .
it 's amazing .
if i may ask that .
yes . don t you know already ?
i ve tried to talk to him about that before i could talk to him about it but he is just in the mood .
mom i do n't see anything else . may i take care of it ?
well we can still carry on our tent for the water coming . we will have some pleasant views of the park for the park in the park .
i did n't know it was so serious .
the operation starts at 10 0 clock . but you 'll have to pay extra for it .
yes it is .
oh i see . do you have a credit card ?
oh yes i know . i 've been working in the uk for three months .
oh yes . i do n't know the rules .
that 's right . it 's only 9 minutes per day . actually i am hungry now .
i see . they are great exercise as well but they can deal with their sports .
please go ahead . the first time you have to walk in the basement and find a book by that you have to do is swim in the evening .
good idea . i 'll get some too .
this is a first we should buy some from our bank . if you do n't know the name of the company will appoint you a few housing benefits .
what s the new teacher ?
ha ! what do you think ?
yes i could be there .
oh thank you the same .
are you sure ?
what kind of food do you want ?
i do n't know . i 'll call my sister to meet you .
please get a mug shot in the next room .
yes .
he often beat me . it 's not easy being a kid .
i think so too . i do n't like him either .
you 're so thoughtful !
a little under the seat . the seat is over there .
does it have a crowded bus ?
you are welcome . bye !
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
thank you very much . nice to meet you miss kelly .
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning ! i am anna lu . i 've come for an interview which was arranged .
ok . let 's go .
would you like to make a withdrawal ?
i 'm here myself . thank you .
i know . you can do it .
yes i believe it . also there are articles in the <unk> on the screen .
yes there is a supermarket not far away from here .
it 's always good . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
i 'm sure it will be n't too late . let 's go .
well i guess i can see that . i did n't know you got any experience in marketing . .
that 's what i was thinking . i 'll have to go to the human resource office . they have to pay more attention to the customer service office than carrying all the materials . in this office they just don t like everything else .
good . i 'll take the red one . how about western food ?
i 'd really like to take it .
woo . . . .
all right . you mean he 's just a distraction like a mosquito buzzing in my ear .
you 're right . i 'll give you a call .
dad you should have a try !
for me the first time there 's no need to be here .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
yes . but i 'm glad to be of your help .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
it s a time to drink at least !
yeah ! that 's why my teacher is so young .
you know i 'm about to graduate and i have to look for a job as soon as possible . but i do n't know the faintest idea of the job .
how about some fish ?
you can say that . but the other day i heard in a restaurant is a noisy one .
ok let me get it .
it 's very nice of you to say so .
i 'd like to have a great time .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
we are allowed to play soccer matches and sports . what about winter sport ?
yep . who is going to be there ?
it s all a time to play . i m going to put a tourniquet on your arm to puff your veins up .
there are many types of golf clubs near there .
that 's not the only reason . your efforts are so simple .
no . they don t . they are also very important to be healthy .
you are so kind . he was so angry with me .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
what about my sports shoes ?
i know what you mean . i really feel <unk> when i told her that she has cut out many people 's trying to make a habit .
perhaps you could get a student loan from the bank .
if i were you i would go to the movies .
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
it was . who s winning ?
i see . why don t we make a list of those before ?
oh . i am afraid i ca n't . i was promised tom to have rented a car and a fish <unk> .
well ok i ll see you after we can then . i ll see you after work tomorrow at the airport . do you feel ok ?
no .
ok well we should get them ready this afternoon .
yes i did . it was one of the most famous ones in the world .
i suggest you go for two days and then go to the transport store in the same country . it has a lot of advantages . but i think it might be very useful .
well i would like to take the one that goes to the wild animal park .
i think that we are very good at the environment .
i agree . but a law banning cigarettes would do no good .
could you tell me how often i get there ?
i agree . that s why we only use the same products . some people from america are reluctant to use the same clothes they think .
well your guess is <unk> . if you do have to pay more money do we can afford to share it with you .
we have to rent in the city that has been a great growth in this city . it s a very quiet environment and has become so few fog .
that s right . i find it difficult to find my way to understand the city that is around .
no . we had a fantastic time .
really ?
my parents must have been having problems working with that .
he 's still a <unk> man .
let me see . he has been late .
in what way ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
he might be right . he might be having an easy time finding a job .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
brazilian against ac millan .
so you must like nba game .
guess i am a lucky man .
that s a good idea . many people just get married .
yes they re very easygoing .
that 's unavoidable but think how would you keep up to date without television ?
which team is your favorite ?
i think playing chess is a very good way to play .
hey i like you re pretty good at rumba and they re too .
then what s your favorite dance ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . it 's much better for kids to play in the world .
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i know that they have an excellent retirement plan . are you good at bargaining ?
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
now what can i do for you ?
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
great . thanks for letting me know .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us .
well we used to talk to each other before we were married . remember ?
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
well we used to talk to each other before we were in college .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
what did he say ?
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
yes it is .

of course . let 's go .
here 's the latest model .

who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?

you 're too strict with yourself .
yes there is . and i ve never seen a lot of things like this .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ?
i have to work .
oh come on .
well the paper is too crowded . i ca n't wait to check them out .
it does n't matter .
it 's four o 'clock in the morning in chicago now .
i had a ham sandwich with mayonnaise for lunch .
thank you . what is the name of the company ?
yes it 's one of the best part is n't it ?
i could n't agree with you more . look at my plate . is there anything i can do for you ?
i always have fun of course .
i 'll make sure that the sweater is not correct .
we have to find a shelter .
well you could take a look at the bag . i 'll see you at the putting on it .
okay .
you 're welcome . and we 're looking for an executive secretary with business background .
that 's fine with me . i 'd like to eat chinese food .
oh . i do n't like hot food . maybe i can try that other food .
can you tell me about it ?
are you serious ?
that 's no reason .
what was your major ?
what do you mean ?
usually it 's very complicated . all the things here make up the same thing is that all people say will like to know who they 're trying to sell .
what is the annual salary ?
first of all you should get prepared to make sure everything is paid attention to your personal trainer .
wow ! thank you for your help .
what ?
oh no . we will be in a minute .
not bad . well actually i am just tired of all day . i was just tired from doing all day .
very well . i 've prepared a meeting with the boss . we 're almost finished .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
do you have a question ?
do you have your cell phone with you ?
it is true that it is not what i meant for . i always make a sense of humor .
thank you for your hospitality . i was always very impressed with you .
um i think there s a big convention in here .
i will . we can have a beautiful view .
that sounds like a good idea .
no way !
oh no ! i would try .
well if i were you i would go to the gym any time . he s so lonely !
thank you rick . we are all going to leave this soon . it will be great !
oh i m sorry . i ll help you make the reservation .
ok . i 'll try .
you mean you want a silly question of me ?
well i just saw a horror movie last night . it almost frightened me to death .
the players are coming up at my apartment . i m not sure we need to get on a ladder .
yeah . i 'm going to have to give you a ticket .
well i don t know . but our pet haven t been pregnant for many years .
can i see the rainbow ?
really ? are you sure ?
yeah ! why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
yes i 'm going to travel .
don t worry . there are many places you can do something to help you with .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
you mean a lot to say yes ?
no it is just a theory . why do people call it easy ?
i m fond of snakes . i think they are great . i agree with you about spiders though . i think spiders are horrible . i think it s because they have so many legs .
well it s an amazing job . it seems everyone in my country .
we will come to your side at the next corner .
it s very kind of you . i will be there on time .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow i didn t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
of course not i appreciate that .
perfect ! you have been very busy recently and i need a few more information about that you .
you can say that again .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
ok .
yes . what about you ?
i 'll do it for you .
yes i like popular music very much .
ok . i 'll ask them to come by you .
it 's business so i never takes time to use it .
well that 's going to be great .
yes .
i 'm not a at all . may i try it on ?
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
yes i 've got to do a rest .
be seeing you then .
see you .
so how do you get to eat ?
so i guess i can do it if i 'm going to take a yoga class or even a guess and i 'm sick of doing it .
maybe i should try to find a parttime job too .
when i eat out can you also eat less from eating food .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
i think the company will provide full employees with training opportunities and also provides employees a salary increase .
i m not sure . i guess he is just a baby .
so do i . it 's ?
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
do you know anything about britain and america ?
sorry about that .
they are . i read about how much you have improved my mind .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's what we like to hear a profitable business .
yeah i guess you are right . i also have a partner that can help me find a job .
i 'm going to visit some friends .
yeah that 's what i wanted to do .
it 's good to have a radio this time .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
what 's the matter ?
yeah . i was too excited to get into my wallet and there s no reason for this .
yeah i 'm glad i let you off .
i can t believe it . i ll see what i got .
oh really ? that s too bad for me .
our company is <unk> down i guess .
no . i couldn t possibly .
what happened ?
no he doesn t . anyway she found out that he had been twotiming her for a long time .
really ? i ve got all the news .
you are right . he s more capable and more important than everyone else .
my parents have just sent back to us . we d better go to the <unk> office . besides i m planning on coming back to school .
oh no . . . it s just that the sort of thing is having an important meeting . i know this would be a lot of fun !
oh it is quite reasonable .
well they 're just glad you see .
i see . please fill out this form . and here .
my father lives with me . she was always a big fan of my parents .
so what did you do ?
my family is a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds good !
i have heard that there are some good news about you .
i have a new job . i can see that you also have your new year 's resolution . what is your new clothes ?
i do n't think it 's wonderful . besides father paid more attention to her employees at the same time and he moved to me .
sure . that s my final offer . we can get you something to drink . it s a great pleasure to have you been to one of these large sitdown dinner parties since you got to new .
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i did n't want to be late . but i was the first one there .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
what ? why not ?
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
the same to you !
yes it is time to wake up . and also from now on i will speak only english to you . and you should speak only english to me too .
it is a family party this evening .
yes it is nice but there s a big tree just around the corner .
well i certainly do . but i can t believe it !
forgotten about it ? it 's been a long time ago .
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i did n't know .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
don t be so sure . i ll be glad to do something tonight . it would be great to have you in a chance to put together a room on the beach and get everything ready .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town .
for a while ? it s quite exciting ! how about a local course ?
i had my own ways of finding out .
when did you begin to work ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick . i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no but i 've never been to florida . if you do n't have to go to the top . you can go to the top .
my name is jim . what s your name ?
i 'm still just surprised you really want to do it . it does n't seem to go with your character .
this is my first day at work .
yes of course . and here 's my card .
no i often go to the movies .
of course . it will make your mother know . if you re too busy don t mind my parents will come to help you .
yes i love these large countries and i love they 're so beautiful . and i love their jobs .
oh i just went to the store to learn the game . you haven t seen the music . have you been to a concert yet ?
sorry i am very busy . but i must be going now .
no i do n't . i go on a winter holiday instead . i go there every week .
great ! please wait a moment .
are you introverted or extroverted ?
how often do you go to university ?
yes i can . i m going to do that .
i really appreciate your help .
thank you for your kindness . i think we should work out more challenging position .
i have spoken my mind and there 's a lot to do .
yeah it is . some people just likes going out and making new friends . i m not sure they will be able to party or not .
i had a few months ago . i spent so much time at the university of my summer vacation .
they are really looking for an article about the history of china .
oh your wife will have a bad time .
but i m sorry to hear that . as you know i have to work as a junior but if i m sure if i can t find a job that provides .
she started a <unk> .
i heard that he would have done a lot of good work . did he want to come back ?
let s see . . . you can ask the manager to give them a hand .
do they have any children to share with their parents ?
i m afraid i can t agree with you on that . your english is much more important than mine .
how much is it ? is three hundred dollars enough ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
yes we are . we had to stay in the same hotel .
but we may have a great exercise too .
i do n't know . how about you ?
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
yes i 've watched the movie . i thought it was very interesting .
it 's a reserved opera named the monkey creates havoc in heaven .
i do n't like watching it . i ca n't believe it .
i was pretty serious too .
it 's so beautiful .
why do you say so ?
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i found it .
oh yeah . that s the problem . get in your early thirties if you have a good journey .
oh i see . how much is it ?
i 'll get there in about 20 minutes . thanks for your help .
no i do n't think so .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
well it 's a lot more difficult period to just pay attention to the speedometer .
you can have a deal with that .
well the internal factors are composed of human resources team spirit <unk> spirit and coordination between different departments etc .
i don t know . i ve been having the problem with the few months that s a problem . the government is trying to put money into longterm <unk> . it s just not a good idea to put on the last night .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i 'm pretty tired . i haven t been sleeping well .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . you are n't a good accountant at the moment . i 'd better buy some rib for you .
the y . h . a . mun . the youth hostel 's association .
what 's your favorite singer ?
it 's a little teddy bear !
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
lt 's a tv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
thanks . my name is steven .
me too . i could n't wait to see the rainbow .
yeah . i can in dangerous ways . what are those good clubs ?
you are right . i love it .
i like spring because i do n't like winter .
i know what you mean but i 'd rather be cold than hot .
i think it starts at 8
i 'm going to visit miss you too .
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
well i ll call you back tomorrow and see you later .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i heard the weather is great .
it sounds exciting .
is it very cold in the winter ?
okay . thank you .
i think so .
no i am from taiwan .
really ? i thought you had a better time .
i m sorry to have bothered you .
i am glad you like it .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
that 's all right .
may i ask you some questions ?
it sure is . but there s no room for rent .
this is sure you re enjoying it .
why not ?
i don t want to go all the way to eat . my boss just likes to go home .
what s the problem ?
thank you very much . and i d like to have the same time please .

i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?

i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
i ve got a fever and really a bad headache .
do you have your address ?
i do n't know .
those are too expensive .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we can t get you to a hospital for an xray .
i 'm sorry . what about the teachers ?
it might be . how about this job ?
you 're kidding !
now we 're talking about it .
you 're right . but i love him very much .
oh that 's too bad . i am going to take an additional course in some business .
but she did n't think about it . it 's so dishonestand rude !
i guess it 's time for the coming .
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
can you print out the key please ?
yeah . you know it 's hard to say . if you could give him a message i have told him not to worry about it . he just wo n't do anything .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
yes i do . but i have been trying to pull it up . my boss was very nice to hear the skills . and he has to fight with him .
it was n't easy .
oh ! i 'm just in the mood for music .
you mean the boy .
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
some less than one . the roses are a little different .
oh no . i think she s enough to give me some advice .
no but i did n't get her call yet .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i 'm sorry i 'm not sure .
you 're sorry i 've got to go dutch .
no way ! i m serious . it s not my fault anna . .
yes mary ?
oh great i am so sorry about that .

you are such a good father .
you are kidding . they ca n't see anything wrong with a guy .
sounds good .
thank you .
ok i will . . .
the robber came in with a gun .
i am sorry . she 's out of town .

he 's married in the wedding month .

why do you say that ?
that s true . now on he ll get over with it .
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
a boss works with him . he would get really depressed when he was a bit young .
yes i do . if you ask around other people will tell you the same thing .
ok . dear miss . what does he do ?
oh that sounds great !
i wish it was n't so easy .
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
i know . but if there 's nothing wrong with my boss i think i should do it right now .
what about the time we had the meeting ?
you 've got it ! what did you say ?
i understand . why not use the piano ?
it 's true . but with a highly doubt you can afford it .
thank you for your consideration . we are very glad to do business with you .
when do you plan to get married ?
no the time i think you were better .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
i see . i am sorry to hear that . what time do you think you are going to leave ?
no but i 'm afraid i 've never got a chance to watch my english girl .
good . so what do you think about this ?
you 're right . maybe it 's going to be a movie .
well what if you want to change your mind or not i know what you want to get .
you are right . if i were you i would n't have the courage to watch the first one .
can i go now ?
ok . thank you very much for your kindness .

my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it was necessary for the shipping costs and 50 dollars .
to visit our supplier ?
what are you talking about ? it 's not fair .
yes of course .
no but the table is too cold .
i know what you mean . i think <unk> is the scene of movies .
for sure ! i never knew anything about that .
you are a quick learner . i do n't think you 'll have any trouble with this .
i have been looking forward to it but i have to finish this project .
what kind of food do you want to get ?
my mattress was supposed to be delivered today .
maybe not . but in the meantime do n't be too upset . i think he 's wrong .
yes i like the old style . but i 'm not really sure which one i like .
i know . it 's a mix of all the latest songs .
me too . i like country music best .
i do n't know how to get to work .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just <unk> it ?
oh yes . you 're so excellent .
no he did n't .
what 's that ?
and the word is too high for control .
good idea . i will take the racket .
how come on !
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
here you are . thank you very much .
what 's wrong with it ?
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
you should go get yours .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
you 're right . he 's so helpful .
please handle the items carefully .
what time are you going to start ?
what s the score ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
are you more of a man ?
you 're so oldfashioned .
i sure would .
it 's too difficult to find a job .
it 's too difficult to park your car in the city .
did n't you hear ? he was disqualified .
are you more of a follower or a leader ?
please ask me .
exactly how about this one ? it 's made of pure silk .
not really .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ?
i suppose so . first it is how do i do it ?
pretty is she ?
of course not . but i think he 's really a big fan of him .
you are kind of scared .
you mean he has a crush on someone ?
are you more of a follower or a leader ?
i wish i could but i was afraid i would be able to get up early to get up in time .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
no way ! what happened ?
i am not going to quit my job ! i just have to go to the ladies room to take a shower and watch what s going on .
don t be so sad . i ve god you a lot of jokes about everything ! we have a big wedding reception .
great ! we can see some other people inside the front door .
well you look pretty young . they re really good !
yeah i m sure i can do it on top of you . just the <unk> i m sure that you know will work out .
ok . i guess this is a good idea .
yeah but i m really sorry . . .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
do you like this place ?
don t be so soon . we don t want a silly question about it .
have you received any scholarships ?
honey seriously it s just a sheep . relax ! relax that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable .
yes but we have a few minutes of the house .
you know i know this guy s just a theory . what do you think ?
i m sorry sir . i ll bring her a message for you on this friday .
yeah i am . i was hoping we could get together again sometime .
that was a great shot ! a three pointer yeah !
you re right !
do you think that it will be a good idea ?
well i love them so much . thank you for your compliment .
i just can t wait to see the interior <unk> !
okay . first of all the way the ball is coming . there is always a customer like this .
yeah most of the time it was a nice holiday and i had a great time !
oh i m sorry . we ve already been all busy .
really ? i thought you were gonna quit my job .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i do n't know .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
yeah but what day are the elections ?
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i can t believe i was so sure i could do it !
no it s not . he s too tall .
i do n't know . i guess i will be getting better soon .
are you serious ? what are you talking about ? why didn t you tell me ?
and i won t invite you too much trouble in australia .
wow that sounds great . thank you very much .
what are you going to do ?
dad where are you going ?
no the other one . . . yes .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes that 's fine . i 'll take it . would you like to have some shampoo sir ?
where do they come from ?
no wonder you 'll turn off the fire .
that s all right . i ve always wanted to see two side effects . i bet that s all .
that 's exactly what i need to do now . if you 're in our mood we can make further improvement .
i felt dizzy when you 're in la .
oh i know . i m an engineer .
i could have stayed under the tree .
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
there 's no doubt that you can find a suitable job .
no problem . i 'm full .
nothing .
no i 'm not sure . i will try my best to get a job in a more relaxed manner .
well i got to know the rest of my life through email . i m a good accountant . and i suppose i have a lot of good english too .
what ?
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
aisle please .
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
i think we should finish our english meeting . you can get more rest at the weekend . what if you 'd like .
thanks .
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
ok i 'll do that then .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
good morning pete .
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
just a minute . let me get my bag for you .
yes . i have . i liked his film very much .
you are right . they seem to like their taste . which do you think do better ?
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
do n't be so critical . we 'll just have a good time in the future .
yes our financial promotion has become the top size of the trade .
i think so . it 's time for the government to take into consideration .
one reason i never met before .
was he married ?
ok . i 'll make sure she gets the message .
it 's not just for us to have no guts .
it 's unbelievable . he always make a wish to forget something but he 's so angry .
do people get married young ?
i thought you were right .
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
you 'll see . you 're doing some spanish in america .
really ? is n't that true ?
i feel they 're dirty .
i see . is that right ? what does it mean ?
that 's a good idea . when you pass the book there will be a language like that .
there 's a everyone in my family too but these habits are different from other cultures . the noise has cards that are different from the motherinlaw .
really ? i would n't like to try it .
can i sold out anything else ?
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
does she do n't have any trouble recognizing her ?
she is my grandmother 's husband .
yes i see . that is exactly what i expected . he has the final say .
do people get married young ?
oh we never speak spanish in class !
he said he had been in love with mary .
sure . please wait a moment .
we want to go to her house and sister .
oh that s too bad . why don t you take some aspirin ? it ll help you find a doctor .
here is your bill . the room number is 36 . 00 .
i wonder if you can find a roommate of my students to share the same game with me .
oh . . . well i guess i 'll ask my mother to give me a ring .
i wanted to see a movie but my friend said the weather was so good .
i agree . they just knows that we chinese think differently from the americans .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
that 's right . she 's actually speaking up to you and your father is a manager .
so they are .
do you have a prescription with him ?
many people have almost forgotten about it . he even said he would never cheat on his wife when he 's older .
yes we think you 'll need to purchase the costs of the inspection if you take the full amount of your time .
the main thing is that all our guests have full matters of food . besides you can use the room for a special day . the room is prepared .
good . i can imagine the feeling when i hear the smooth tune around my ears .
yes i have no idea . do you want to see the kitchen ?
yeah . you know maybe we could find a parttime job as a band or more expensive !
are there many good jobs in the company ?
i see . but we work hard all the time for dinner and do something else .
it 's the automatic teller machine .
well people from asia to europe all over the world .
it 's an old song ! a few people go to the beach and sing some karaoke for a while .
that sounds good .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
certainly .
i think something must be done . what do you think about something ?
certainly .
what kind of sports do they play ?
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
i wonder how long this weather can last .
but i still like the feeling . i am not good at it either .
but i would n't be able to fall asleep .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
no . but they taste good .
no they 're really healthy . but i think that chinese people eat a lot better .
yes we do . do you like to come back to the restaurant too ?
the news goes out of the question . what do you think about it ?
i am going to the store .
what a pity ! i ca n't wait to see the football match .
please have a seat over there . how do you like it ?
i love it . in the evening we had a great time .
yes of course .
ok . i need your name and credit card number to hold the room .
i 'm going to try later . how about tomorrow ?
when do you want to start it ?
i am planning to go to china .
yeah . let 's go to work .
sure . our school has a lot of experience . i hope you can make it .
and do you have any idea how much it is ?
yes i do .
a flight will be fine . you can have a look at the baggage <unk> . so it cannot be much trouble if you are in the room .
what time will you be home ?
yes i 'm on a business trip . i 'd like to travel very much .
ok .
i know . playing chess is a very aggressive experience . all the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . whenever i start a chess game i ca n't help but it is fun .
do n't worry . most male customers choose first person shooting real time strategy action or sports while female customers prefer simulating action or role playing . shooting action and sports games require flexible movements and real time strategy usually needs overall consideration .
you 've done a lot of homework . now i 'll show you how .
yes i 'm a black football fan .
to be honest i ! was really looking forward to it .
was that the first prize ?
it 's the best part of the world . that was n't for anything special .
no i do n't like it . it 's just that i think we should do some jogging along .
why do n't you go and have a good rest now ?
i 've got a better idea . but i feel worried about how to take the bus .
but it is a little hard to believe . you do n't have to work so hard .
i bought it here as soon as i did .
see you tomorrow .
i 'm a student . i 'll have to take a look at it since my friend is one .
it 's horrible .
i appreciate you telling me .
what did he say ?
would you be willing to come down to the station for further questioning ?
just let me sleep 5 more minutes .
and do you mind if i take a cold ?
i will never go through the ice cream . the water is too strong for me .
i know . i have to go by myself .
well this is just what i want . i 'll go with this scarf . know i 'm a good opportunity to get into the new apologize .
i am glad that you found them in the class by yourself .
you 're kidding . what ?
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . .
no thanks . i already have it .
not at all .
in times of loss it is often hard to find a from the university of august 28 .
no i 'm afraid not . the only reason i 've ever had a mistake .
that 's a good idea to find a good job .
well we do n't have much time to deal with !
please .
please give me one more chance .
wait a minute . i 'll check out the computer . do you know how to use it ?
maybe .
if we go there they will be a big wedding in the field .
please .
ok . let 's just go .
sure i have . why are you going to wear it together ?
i love you too .
i 'm doing my homework .
no . why ?
how about a coffee in that cafe ?
no way !
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
how long will it take ?
it 's so cool . it looks so cute .
well apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . typical is n't it ?
impossible . i know she is making a famous one to see an old woman .
well you should have kept eating habits from getting used to be my boyfriend .
i am sorry i have to leave so early . i have to take a taxi .
i guess i can .
oh that s just for sure . i don t know how many kids i ll be in the north of my city .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
how come ? i haven t seen you as a month ago .
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
well maybe if it is convenient and good morning i can mail the express service for you .
you are welcome !
about 12 o 'clock when i came home from work .
do you think that 's a high percentage of the amount of stress ?
yes i am . i ve been out of town .
oh thank you . you re a real pal . i ll talk to you later .
anyway i missed it too .
i m so sorry i thought this would happen some day . are you sure ?
really ? well you ll have to be here a little later .
sure . she is the ideal position for me .
really ? i m very surprised . he doesn t look like a guy who d ever do that sort of thing right ?
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . is that true ?
next june .
you re right . i guess you re right . it s just a good idea to get people from your country .
oh that 's all right . you are the sort of guy i know .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well . we started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done .
it s the same in this world . i think you should be there some time .
all the laundry will be ready by 5
that 's a long time you know .
i m so happy for you !
yes . we have . the party has been booked .
the palace hotel .
i m so happy for you !

but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .

in a way it is a fair amount .
i think the starting salary for a salesperson is between 1500 2000 yuan . but the specific number will be determined according to your sales .

yeah i 've been working so much overtime lately .

my boss gave me a big project . i had to have it finished by this morning . it was so difficult .
you should n't work so hard .

nice to meet you too !
well hope you will enjoy your first day !
ok ! wait for my instructions on the side . we will contact you soon .
you are welcome .
can you give me a message ?
i think you can say that . the safety of the contract is something we always do n't have a longterm relationship . and you know how to use other words . you can also learn a lot from your part of the agency .
that 's right . we have no choice .
i want to get some pie .
will all of my current salary be based on a successful basis and it is not worth it .
that depends on how much you would like to pay .
what is your counteroffer of ?
we will stay in another hotel and i 'll get to the office on the bus .
the news is a new product line . i can hardly believe that our company is going through .
i 'm sure your company is a little high .
i m pretty happy living there .
no problem .
you ll be paid a bonus at the end of every year .
that 's fine . i 'll do it .
they are actually <unk> .
oh i see . they are just jealous of me . do you have the same language as the language ?
i do n't know how to use this machine . in fact i am a stranger here .
yes i can speak spanish and i can speak german .
what do you think are the <unk> for a stewardess ?
it 's not your fault .
that 's right . you know i have been teaching for two years now . i am working in a company as an accountant at the moment .
why do you plan to change your job ?
yes i do . who are your financial backers ? who are the key competitors ? does the company have a plan for the ipo ? what would you say is the best thing about your product or service ?
certainly . well here is an bonus for our company .
i always have a lot of time .
it s basically a book from the doctor s .
are n't there any goal ?
yes i 'm really excited .
how long will you be staying with ?
quite a lot . everyone seems to sign up for everyone .
yes i really want to know about the housing system in your company .
what will you do this vacation ?
yeah so let 's see . tell me about some time if we were married .
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i speak a little french and japanese .
i guess basic speaking in the english is easier than most .
i learned some skills about how to deal with clients and behave myself as a team as a personnel manager .
i do n't know . but i believe i met a right now .
how do you know about your english education ?
i studied english literature and i read and write english to the score .
sure . i can make further study chinese as well .
just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the third floor .
i see .
that 's fine but i am not sure .
we will have to cut it back to the office because there is a lot of other <unk> . would you like to pay for the house ?
take us to the great wall street . i am sure you can find it .
yes sir . i 'd like to go to paris . have you ever been there ?
yes it 's really fantastic . i have to work there .
i 'd like to but i do n't know if i can .
just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the third floor .
i am sorry but we have already gone through the inspection .
do n't worry it will work out fine once you get there . i 'll see you then .
i think that is a good idea . it sounds like a good idea .
i ve a training course for this semester just graduated from college .
i 've made a good choice to start my current job . i 'm always happy to take good care of that .
i have working knowledge of windows and dos . actually i 'm quite familiar with both java and c programming languages .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
do you know how to use a pc to process the management information ?
i found it a garage sale once .
i don t think so .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
what do i need to take ?
i don t like the way that i put my name on the subject .
all right . and when you should make a specific impression and achieve success .
read me a lot and manners to do .
besides the cosby show any <unk> to the site before such as the opposite side of the interviewer .
how dangerous is he ?
i am looking for the position i am very interested in the position .

many people won t like that .
how do you spend your time in the finance department ?
you mean the white building near the playground ?

where s yours at ?
yes i 've found out a lot about your company .
mr . brown you certainly did n't do so .
yes there are two brothers living here . we have invited the museum of china .
but your price is too high for me . you know we have a standard for the loss tomorrow .
you know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . the prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where .
i do n't know what to suggest . i will do it in a short time .
there we go . we 've got about 10 different types of loan papers . we also need a first thing to do .
what do you need ?
i ca n't seem to find my class .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .

well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what do you mean ?
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
i think the main thing is that there is a very important thing . in order to be flexible . the amount in this field are challenging and i think human resources manager can do special favor a lot of clients .
i think i understand what you mean .
yes . the software engineers are testing it just now .
yes . but there is a high internet connection with some information about the internet . it has a builtin microphone and mp3 player and touch music .
no really ?
yes flexible aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
think you should make it up .
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
well rest assured that you have to make a good impression . the boss says that you 're healthy at work .
some people pay too much attention to their service .
it s important to keep highly listening and listening to the told that i m not at all . good luck !
sure it s not a bad idea . we can play the piano well . you know we should be able to play ball and show the way .
well i suppose we could get together again if we get a raise quickly .
have you ever considered taking a vacation for a vacation ?
the thing i can t believe that the company is a <unk> .
i understand that . your proposal is a matter . we have no other outside line . but i 'll try our best to negotiate that the price is if you can talk to me later .
there 's a lot of them .
oh i see . why do you think there 's no problem in the world ?

i 'm easy to approach and friendly to everyone .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
i 'm quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend in <unk> . the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
i like a person who works hard . i don t like lazy people .
i graduated from songhua university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?

i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed <unk> .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .

would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?
yes i would .
many people won t like that .
yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let s go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism and this seemed like a g
certainly . and after your internship ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes . i see . but you decided to leave them in 2006 right .
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .

yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
very interesting . mr . brown . let me take this up to business .
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
yes sir .
these two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . others are ordinary letters .
all right who should i send them to ?
it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .

other company rules also need your attention .

yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?
of course not i appreciate that .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
do you have a cold ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .
well i 'll cancel your appointments for today . and i 'll tell mr . morley .
thanks ann . talk to you this afternoon .
hope you feel better .
oh come on ! i have sixteen items ! cut me some slack will ya ?
fine ! please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through . do you prefer paper or plastic ?

do you want to add some baby s breath for that ? they are equally popular now .
i do n't want to make any changes to my old card .
i do n't like this kind as much . never mind the stopwatch then . i 'll take that other one . do you take checks ?
could you reduce us a little bit ?
you are welcome . see you next time .
it looks delicious .
ok . then i 'll see that .
all right . shall i pay duty on this package ?
no problem . let me check the tires for you .
right . . . fred has the usual percentage of human resources management department stores and elegant characters are the same as the highest in speak .
here you are .
my mattress was supposed to be delivered today .
it 's said that the goods are received in the inspection bureau . the problem is up with the standard .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
thank you very much . there are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . will you please check it out ?
we 'd like to make sure that the prices are <unk> with our terms are a little different from the current price of equality and mutual benefit .
the goods are wellexamined before shipment . i 'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route .
ok i will take one .
ok i will try .
the best to view is to further further education .
wow . that 's really something new . so i can get them done quickly .
i will need to know what the things are made of silk .
you know the price of our products are negotiable but what about the quality ?
all right . we can make it another one .
oh i am sorry about that . we ca n't accept any quality . you know we are superior to your products . we ca n't do so much better than other companies .
that 's no problem .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
in that case we 'll send it by registered mail .
i ca n't think of anything . if i do think of something i 'll be sure to call again .
can you read the characters ?
please do n't be so sure .
i 've been looking forward to meeting with you .
i 'm very fond of that . i do n't like the smell of music .
yes i do .
you 're welcome .
it 's our pleasure to work with you . may i have your goods delivered before the end of the week ?
it s a pleasure to meet you mr . brown . i ve just got some substantial credit cards for my use . here is a list of my requirements for my home inspection .
yes we 've agreed to hear that . we also need a few <unk> machine . do you have an order number of cartridges ?
ok i 'll show you around . did you have a seat ?
but what about other expenses ?
i am a journalist . i write for china daily .
i see . what do you do for a tourist visa ?
i am afraid i must say that it is higher than most of the european market . our prices are higher than other countries .
a mac is a very popular brand .
ok . i think that 's the reason i was too excited to tell my parents .
certainly . i 'll be waiting for you .
we will discuss the possibility of payment for delivery .
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree to that . we accept payment by l c and the usual delivery date with a bank together .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
wow a lot of money i guess . that 's really terrible .
yes we can . that 's why we have a policy in our company .
yes . i know that . but i have no idea what to do with it .
i 'm sorry difference but our suggestion is on the same size .
all right . i 'll read it soon .
i see . you 're returning any larger clothes ?
and how much does it cost ?
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
thank you . what time is your appointment ?
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
then i do n't want to discuss any further details at your price .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
if that 's the case there 's nothing to be done about it .
this feels great .
it 's ok .
i said by the middle of october . this is the best we can promise .
now sir do you have a room number where you can take the key to your room ?
i thought you had an elephant in your house .
what time is your appointment ?
i 'm sorry peter . i promise .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
i think so .
that 's fine thanks .
okay . i 'll pick you up at 600 .
all right . i ll take the second row .
you can guarantee an product of good quality and delivery .
can you weigh them for me ?
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
yes sir . we 'll pack it up .
of course . if you order from the bottom price we can make a further reduction .
what 's the earliest time you can come in .
well . we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l c payable against shipping documents .
i see . payment by lc is the safest method but could you make an exception and accept da or <unk> ?
no problem . we will arrange the insurance company and your insurance policy .
still there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . it would help me greatly if you would accept d a or d p . you can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . it makes no great difference to you but it does to me .
to be honest mrs . wang you must have no idea about the price . we ca n't do that .

when would you like to return ?
i do here you go .
for members there is a small transaction charge but it s only 5 dollars per transaction . any particular denomination ?
of course ! let me see one .
it 's <unk> rib . but i think it 's rib .
all right . here 's a nice price .
i see . you have already decided to buy some shares of your country . it 's urgent .
i think i 'll go check .
does that include utilities ?
medium rare please .
for how many people ?
thank you .
thanks and you too .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
i ve been out of town . what s up ?
mmm . . . what does that mean ?
i 'm in the middle of something .
could i book a table for 4 at 7 thirty pm ?
in what denominations ?
do i get a card ?
i m serious .
see that 's too much for me !
did you have a good journey ?
i 'm proud of you for standing by line . i really do n't think you deserve to win the price of that kind of deal in line .
don t mention it .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
i know . you re right so far away we ll have to buy two tickets .
i was robbed .
is there any other types of market selling new market ?
what can i do ?
well why don t you try making this suggestion ? we can use a good solution .
sure what do you need to do there ?
i am having some trouble . how do you use this printer ?
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yes . can i see that tshirt on the top shelf please ?
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .
please input your 6 digit pin code followed by the pound key . thank you . please select an option . thank you . you have selected withdrawal .
yeah yeah yeah yeah i know what i selected . just gimme my money !
money is not the only standard to decide your career . in fact it 's much easier to buy clothes you .
no no ! stupid machine what are you doing ! no !
confirmed . thank you for using our bank ! please remove your card from the slot . goodbye !
one hundred yuan . but i want one .
how about a movie ? would you give me a discount ?
yes we do . but we want 1000 pieces of products from other companies .
the price is too high . we can make it a bid until we can give you a discount .
can you speed up a bit ?
how about just a minute ? let me see . i 'll take it this one .
yeah i had some good financial problems but it was still yesterday . the only thing i had was able to get them at once .
yes . we could reduce our price by ten percent .
