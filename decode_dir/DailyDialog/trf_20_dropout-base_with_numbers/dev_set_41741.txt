they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .

sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . how much do you have ?

do you like western food ?
how much is it ?
i 'm sure it 's a holiday in the united states . we get a lot of special things to do in . the only thing i do is to do so .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .

i see . thank you .
you 're welcome .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but i just want to tell you that i 've put in recently .
i am not sure . maybe we can do the same .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they 're willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
ok .

so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
i love chinese food . it s so spicy . i can really use it .
do you find it hard to get ingredients at the chinese food ?

that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
it must be interesting .
i don t know .
i hope that he will be angry .
i bet .
but i like its color .
what about this one ? it 's a lovely dress . it 's very smart .
i 'll take one too .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .

yes i think that 's the problem .
how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
i have n't even told you what it is yet !

that 's a good idea . it means a little to me .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
why ? it s been a long time since we have a bad time .
it seems that she was really all that strong .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
i apologize for the inconvenience .
i have already told you that i 'm leaving for a week .
i didn t think you would be interested .
why ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
that 's a great idea .
what 's wrong ?
wow .
you were in the right place . i just wondered what you blow . i waited for a while and your bag .
oh i see . sorry to say that 's not the whole point . we should try to improve our article .
no why ?
which one do you recommend ?
you are suspected of hiding illegal drugs so we are taking you into custody . we ve found some heroin in your house . you can hear them from one ear to another . if you believe there are no one who has the gossip columnists would you think you are in to know ?
what was the matter ?
right here . see the scratch ?
it 's all right . but i ca n't understand .
why do n't you go talk to her ?
no .
it looks like it was made just for you .
that 's really tough .
i 'll take a dozen .
i 'm telling you about that . what do you think i should do ?
you can easily get a coffee .
i do n't know .
you have to pay a fine .
how about the new teacher ?
i 'm from textile import and export corporation . i 've come to meet you . i 've got to go .
i am happy that i had a good time .

well i ve done a lot of business for my company . and now i feel like going into business for myself .
no nobody is out of service .
fine just bring it back to me tomorrow .
i 'm very sorry . but to be honest it 's been a lot worse than the bus .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . would you mind coming with me tomorrow ?
what 's that ? what 's it look like ? is it your neighbor ?
if you were hired when he was a kid there would be a job fair .
it 's not the right color . it does n't taste good . is it white gold ?
and what 's special about these shirts ?
really ? i was there a big mistake .
oh it 's no problem .
yes i 'm very positive .
yes . but it is urgent .
they 're usually busy .
yes . it 's very kind of you .
really ? have you got any photos of the company ?
truewell do you have any forwards for me to send him ?
what happened ?
oh is he ?
well there 's no point in making sure .
you know how hard it happened to me . i just lost one thing .
i 'm sorry i know that i care too .
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
yeah . i 'm dead serious .
so what did i do wrong ?
hey that is the new teacher .
it 's the most important thing to do .
yes it 's hard to get used to a traffic jam .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . i did n't know that . but i did n't think it was that they 'd be able to see you again . i hope you did n't see that they would cause us much trouble .
i 'm so sorry . i did n't know that . but i did n't think that i think that i was angry with you . i hope they did n't see her again .
what did you mean ?
yes most of them did .
great ! i 'll tell you who will be driving the van .
that 's good . we will take the next two hours .
that 's good . you 're going to be so happy .
what 's the damage ?
the four of us will be there at 700 this evening .
but we ca n't hold the subject .
yes .
really ? let me think . . . .
what 's the matter ?
just a minute . i 'll pick you up around . . .
right now you have a new car .
ok . and that 's it .
well we do the same things every weekend . we go to the same restaurants . we see the same friends . you know what i mean ?
i was n't feeling too well so i made a phone call to see you .
how much do you want ?
yes . beautiful is n't that dangerous ?
we 're going to have a party tonight .
what did you do last night ?
i think that 's the best we can do .
you 're going to throw out a sweater .
yes . we 've moved out on the honeymoon .
ok .
what was that ?
you re right . i ve tried to use the computer and i ca n't seem to have enough time to control it .
i will ! i could use some good luck !
it 's so nice of you .
it 's a job at an advertisement company .
wow ! that 's just a lot of cash i suppose . it is so hard to get a credit card .
yes .
that 's nice . can you read the characters ?
i 'll do it as soon as possible .
here you are .
yeah i 'm an excellent student too .
no thank you . i 'm full .

i 'm afraid it 's too hard to wash off the stain .
i am sorry to hear that .
it does n't matter .
what a pity !
i am really sorry .
ho no !
i 'm afraid it 's still early .
it 's already 10 minutes .
we 'll have to wait for the next bus .
ok .
it 's a well furnished eatin kitchen . the stove and the icebox are in good order and the plumbing is ok too .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .

yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .

i do n't know .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she is 17 .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but i just want to tell you that i 've put in recently .
i am not sure . maybe we can do the same .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
um . . . . i think we can go for a picnic sometime . let 's go !
good . let 's go now .
do you have any money ?
i am so sorry to hear that . i am very pleased with it .

i 'm sorry to hear that . take care of yourself .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
why not ?
i do n't know .
i ca n't .
well it 's really none of your business .
certainly not .
i 'm afraid there 's been a mistake .

so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .

ok i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
what a pity .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
is the hotel going to be finished ?
it does n't matter .
i was sick .
i 'm sorry to hear that . why do you think you 've been so tired ?
sure . what can i do for you ?
i 'm looking for a pair of shoes .
oh i know the room . well i 'm the landlord now . you know we are now having a lot of room .
i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
i 'm sorry to hear that . it was really a good friend .
no but i 'm not sure .
how would you like to pay ?
i do n't know how to explain it in english .

oh it tastes really good . what do you think ?
you 're welcome .

well i 've been looking forward to your new job .
coffee please .
what colour are you going to buy ?
yes i do .
thank you .
that s fine .
oh no . the bank is closed .
this one is perfect for me .
i 'm afraid it 's too hard to find a job .
yes it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
actually i 'm calling to complain about that . i bought a new service the cost of a week .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is wrong ?
it does n't matter . it looks like you have a different color .
do you know when it leaves ?
i 'm sorry for the damage .
i know . i am really sorry to hear that .
well . . . i guess i m not sure if it s not too much trouble .
do you have to pay to go to gym ?
that s expensive .
i think we should be more careful .
oh that 's easy .
well i hope they re not getting any money soon . i ve been working too hard to keep the company down .
what are the disadvantages of the online shopping ?
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not really . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what ? my daddy gave me this car and i have a lot of money .
well it s true that we have a lot of difficulties . we re going to have to give everyone up the new accord . then what kinds of things are going to be like .
ugh . . . so how long is the ride ?
it 's about an hour .
how am i supposed to get to the finally ?
i m a bit confused .
i m sorry i can t . i have to go to work late .
that s great . i know you ve had a lot of experience in this job .
all right . thank you .
you know that i care for you .
oh it 's the rock 11 .
it 's excellent . how about you ?
yes i do .
what are your hours ?
do n't worry about it .
oh dear ! it s only my day .
really ?
thank you .
that s a good idea .
ok . take care .
it 's very easy .
what are you talking about ? it wasn t just funny .
yeah i know ! but it 's a secret to work !
do you think you ve got a very good idea ?
no i haven t . i can always use my computer to check my email .
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems like a company .
i think that one is better than the others .
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here i will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all you do is to know how to keep your credit record .
great ! i think i 'm ready to start by doing what i need is just being able to do and how to pay for all of my stuff .
oh look there s a spot open next to the public restroom ! can you tell me where it is ?
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like you !
okay . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you think i ll take the children ? my wife told me she thinks she will be very pleased .
um . . . no . my dog s favorite . he s a big nose and he has a dog instead of swimming .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
it 's pretty short .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug and kiss ? isn t that complicated ?
i guess .
well you can t just finish the request .
oh you re so kind .
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
how come ?
merry christmas !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
don t worry about that . i ve decided that you re doing a good job .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look there s a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and forget and forget that you re in the truth .
fine . let s call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
it 's on the 11th avenue park street .
good . i ll just stay in a few minutes .
ok let s do that then !
ok let s go !
i m just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
well you can still remember the first time you had a checkup .
well you certainly have to !
what do you think is the most important thing for you to wear ?
what do you think i should do ?
you 'd better have a brain pressure like you know . you ve got a high brain surgery .
haha . . . . i 'm just <unk> . . .
so what do you think about this ? is that you are a good boss ?
but i am still wet behind you .
yes . and not expensive either .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! i need to get a little to the office .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t like the way that i don t like the color . it s too bright .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you re so kind . i don t want to see my parents like me either !
of course not . they are the type of movie i know .
i agree with you .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
that sounds kind of fun .
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'm going to do some shopping .
well you should come this weekend . i know you ve been working too hard .
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
i 'm going to send a fax to you immediately .
i know what you mean . i can show you the best . it 's the latest thing you have in a bar .
i know . i will do that .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal .
do you think that many people in your country like to be happy ?
i have n't seen you for ages .
it 's a taiwanese puppet doll .
well yes . i was very good at the end of the world .
i wish i could n't have been too much happier !
i had a chance to work with people .
i 'm always at your service .
i 'll call the taxi immediately sir .

i 'm on my way out to a new year 's banquet . how do i look ? is my makeup ok ?
but it 's the two of us .
can you believe it or not i can still hear a thing ?
well you can bet this relationship is going to be a flash in the pan .
hmm . . that 's my favorite colour . i know that must have been first .
oh i remember now . you must be joking . you ca n't believe it .
i m afraid i have t . my husband has some . so i ve forgotten about them .

when did he leave ?
what 's the matter ?

great ! how is it going to be ?
well we do n't have the best pasta for this house .

i do n't know . maybe it 's because of the fine things .
that 's great ! i know it 's a beautiful place to see the famous museum of the famous museum of modern art .
well i do n't know .
yes . take myself for example . i seldom go to cinemas but it does n't mean i no longer see films at homewatching ccds .
it 's just around the corner .
what was the score ?
it starts at 8 o 'clock .
that 's fine . we ll have to get on the contract .
i know . i 'm sorry .
could you drop me off on the airport ?
oh my god ! i forgot to buy a new car for my son .
thank you .
i 'm sorry but i think i 'll have to discuss the problem .
a tim please . thank you very much .
well . . . do you have any skirts in this color ?
i am going to miss you too .

do you eat any special food for the festival ?
that s the one .

yes . this is a new business .
what else does it come from ?
yes . with the 600 second digital memory l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .

you should just pay close attention to the safety of the company .
next month .
that 's a good idea . i 'll try it .
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
we 're welcome . hope you will come .
do n't get your mind off the internet . i 'll introduce you .

i am afraid i ca n't .
you can go to the bank if you need to .
ok . let 's go .
so what about my car ?
oh come on ! just a quick one !
what 's it ?
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
so do i . well what are the kids ? is the thing about this time ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
i do n't think so . the snowmaking may cause pollution has improved my organizing ability .
i 've heard about that but as far as i know a factory 's in london is a different town . so i 'd like to see the results .
why do you say so ?
i love you happy anniversary .
that 's the reason you 've never won .
that 's terrible ! what did you do ?
i am going to send you a check .
i do n't know .
i also feel that work efficiency here is very high . and you have to give me the chance of having a child .
i usually just have time to clean up my room .
that 's ok .
yes . and not expensive either .
it is such a nice place .
you 're welcome . i wish you a pleasant stay here .
that sounds good to me .

yes i 've got a beautiful dress in white .
pleased to meet you too .
i love rumba and waltz .
oh the music has stopped .
i like to play the piano .
no not at all . i like that one myself .
oh yes . i ca n't dance the waltz well .
what 's that ?
are you a really interested in <unk> ?
yes . the ancient teachers are supposed to be good but they are not good enough . they are not actually used to <unk> .
is that so ? i do n't like the collar that is popular with young people .
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west the purpose is generally quite <unk> savor the wine .
that 's right . i like to be an understanding of my muscle .
they 're from <unk> .
is n't the reason why they 've been making a lot of money to buy things ?
it 's very popular among all the time .
yes . i like it very much .

i really wanted to watch the star wars on the opening day but the presale tickets were sold out . how did you manage to get hold of them ?
certainly .
you know all about coffee . i need you to keep me awake .
i think it 's the problem with the security .
it 's a job at an advertisement company .
but i like the feeling of the aluminum .
yes she 's very considerate of you .
i bet you eat a lot more exercise .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
i 'll play with you .
oh yes . i heard that the song is excellent .

yes it is . but there is no wind up in the middle of summer .
do you have any other questions ?
that 's a good idea . i was thinking of it .
ok . i 'll make it .
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring .
i really like it here so far .
it s nice of you to help me . this is the best part i 've ever seen .

i could n't agree more .
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like it there .
what 's the weather like in spring ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
you can read the newspaper . i read the newspaper and get tickets now .
it 's a little cold .
good idea ! we have a good variety of gas in the park .
really ?
that 's fine . i 'll just put the dry .
i do n't think so .
yes i am .

i 'm afraid there is n't any difference in the future .

that 's fine . i 'll see you then .

yes i do . it s very interesting . what s your job ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
i ca n't log on the internet again .
how about 10 percent ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
what 's the matter ?
most people do . another problem is that they did n't stop my car for the environment .
what else is wrong with it ?
i do n't know how to explain it to you .
what are the mbps mainly used for ?
no . that s all .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
i know but i am trying to find out the way to go anyway .
i had to watch a football game instead .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
i see .
well not so good .
you are welcome .
do n't mention it .
it 's my pleasure .
i m a little tired . i feel dizzy .
does he ever talk to him about it ?
yes he is .
why do you say that ?
because i like the feeling of cooperating with others .
you didn t hear about it ? tell me about it .
ok dad .
i 'd like to .
if that 's the case i 'll give you a call .
this friday evening ?
what time does the next train leave ?

i 'll give you a call .
you 're welcome .
then she must have a parttime job .
i know . but i just don t want to give her up .
no .
what 's the difference between her and her hair ?
i think you should open an account at the bank first . after that you can make a decision . after that you can go there and have a good time .
i 'd like to buy a history of foreign country . i 'd like to go to the ladies 's collection of the world and canada .
what type of things are you interested in ?
you said it .
well the teachers teachers teachers teachers also teach us english songs and play games together . they do n't want a teachers class at night .
i believe you can make it .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . i 'd like to see that .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
do you want to go see a movie ?
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i do n't believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem .
yes . i was elected excellent party member for four academic years .
you should have kept an eye on it .
yes . and you can find a parttime job as well .
i know . but they are different .
do you think the same is a little too ?
do you know a lot about me ?
no i didn t . i like the design of the new fashion .
it 's a <unk> . it 's a clothes game .
very interesting . so it seems you are very qualified for this position .
yes . and you 're going to dust your face to a little later .
how about this one ?
i wonder if you can give us a more reduction .
but you know it 's a good opportunity to learn english .
what about taking a walk ?
ok . i will do that .
what are you talking about ? we always eat the stuff here .
just a moment please . i ll go .
yes . you know it 's so hard to believe that you will marry a fitness plan and your father is very important .
do you know if there 's anything wrong with it ?
i do n't want to be like that .
why ? you 're not a child .
yes . it 's the most important thing to do .

ok . and keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over you 'll only have to cook that side lightly . put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese .

i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
no thank you . we just need our check .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
i see .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
i do n't know .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
how many people are there in your party ?
hi paul . i am so happy that you found this man !
what do you think of the traffic today ?
i have lived here for twenty years .
do you think you 'll ever get another chance to speak before i decide ?
do you think you can give me a different color ?
how many ?
ok . i will .
all right . can i have a glass of water ?
i 've been away on a vacation .
yes it is . but it 's already been a long time .
i saw her husband 's car . he was a baby last week .
what do you think of it ?
i just opened my own business not long ago .
what are you going to major in ?
i 'm majoring in english .
in china it is the common practice for personal use .
i will think about it .

it 's my honor to be here .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . . .
yes . i graduated this past june .
i 'm honored to know you .
i 'm fine . thanks .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
oh thank you . yes i am .
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
how much is it ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
oh the weather is so warm .
that sounds good .
i know . but it 's not like the color of our city . i ca n't wait to see what the sky is like in the dark . if it 's not like it will be hot .
it seems the best in spring and the autumn is the best season for our picnic .
okay . hey i 'm so tired . i thought it was a sign of rain .
i do n't think so . you know the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
let 's just hope it does n't get cold again .
well i had a lot of work problems last week .
i m sorry to hear that . but i don t know what to do . would you like to work out another time ?
whatever . drink a lot of water .
she s pretty .
really ? i remember she said if she would remain single . is the man very rich ?
tom that lucky guy .
he s fine but busy now . we ve been busy for a couple of days .
i see . he must have been having an easy time for that .
terrible .
i think you should give her some time . it s been a long time since we have got married .
i 'm afraid he 's gone out of this town .
you 're kidding .
control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know . he 's always on the alist .
yeah . he is a hard worker .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you .
i know what you mean .
really ? i ca n't believe it !
you must have got wrong . it s been a long time since we met each other .
i do n't believe it 's that serious . it s a lot of sad people .
i would n't do that .
i 'm sorry .
i 'll see you tomorrow then .
i 'm sorry but i 've never heard of a thing .
well we can go to the movies this weekend .
i 'm afraid i 've got a wrong turn .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know . but i just don t feel sad about them . i m a real fan of him .
i do n't know . it was robbed at the moment .
thanks for inviting me . see you .
you mean the bleeding are too strict ?
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
that s terrible .
yes . and suddenly i heard someone call my name . i turned around and there was this man looking at me . i did n't recognize him at all but he obviously knew who i was .
thanks .
because she was too angry to her .
oh i do n't know . she must be my cousin .
you have to . it s sure .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
what kind of price do you want ?
i 've got a terrible headache .
i think you should do more exercise .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but now he had a fever he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i 'm working on my resume . it 's a doctor .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
i wonder what he 'll say .
i m in pretty bad shape . i ve got a really bad cold and i m tired .
what does his dad say ?
he is a worker .
i 've got them .
that 's better .
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he was my jobseeking information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
i think you should give him a try .
i know he would do a lot like me to talk to him about it .
i think he 's <unk> is an important ability to cure the ability to cure my daughter 's disease .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell him i 'm a qualified teacher .
maybe he is just being a bit shy .
no i do n't think so .
i know . it 's so nice of you to comfort me .
i like the fact that they are very friendly .
you 're right . he sure is .
really ? no i did n't know that .
really ?
thank you .
well in fact it 's a different world . but in fact it 's a different world . a young people know a lot about china . the world is often located around with others . it 's a different story .
because you are in love with someone else .
oh i see . here 's my card .
no i 'm not . i 'm just trying to take a look .
don t worry about it . i m going to get you to a doctor . you ve got to do some rest .
here is your bill . did you receive the accounts ?
i asked for leave and was at home when i was a kid . i noticed that some people might have received a list of ideas in the company .
out ? what do you mean ?
well i just wanted to say goodbye .
i mean in most cases they are of the chinese and japanese arts .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
she 's going to be sent to britain to study really ?
yeah . it s a good idea to have a look at the same problem .
you said it .
well some people use a standard set of words but a number of different opinions . they do n't want us to get along with each other and do something different .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
i apologize for the inconvenience .
i apologize for the inconvenience .
i didn t think you would be interested .
you ca n't be serious .
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell me what you 're going to do .
so you 're going to do something tonight ?
sorry . it 's too late . i 'll have to meet you at six .
i will try my best to explain them in the next few weeks .
it must be kate .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
i bet you had the right to say something like that . you two were a good team .
no i don t .
i like you to be happy with your decision .
i do n't like that kind of . i like the green one .
you can put many weight into your mouth and be confident . move your arms and your arms are pretty laid back .
i am so happy .
what do you think of the traffic ?
i think so . it s just a little cool .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
i m not sure . we still haven t met any new programs .
i 'm going to do that .
thank you .
oh hey . hey . .

my immediate family is quite small . it s just my older stepbrother my mom my mom my <unk> and me . how about you ?
how ay people are there at home ?
how old is your brother ?
yes but i do n't know that much about the work .
i see . there are a lot of people inside the same a world .
one is a little too wild . it s quite natural to the public .
what s your brother ?
yes we do .
oh i 'm sorry . but i ca n't understand that .
thank you .
no . i didn t know you were going to get a raise .
i want to go camping you know just get a way for the weekend . i 'm not sure i 'll be able to though .

maybe next week .
i 'll call you later then .
ok . i 'll pick you up at about 6 o 'clock .
i 'm sorry i could n't help you . it was very kind of you to come to work so i can always get used to it .
nothing special . what 's up ?

do you think so ?
what 's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
well i do n't mean to say that we have the same problem . there 's always the same friends .
what 's the matter ?
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . . .
she is expecting .
what 's your birth date ?
well we can do them .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
i am so happy that i found this class a new year s resolution .
yes i will be there .
around seven .
ok . i 'll be back at about seven .
no . that 's all . you have to do now .
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
oh it 's nearly half past eleven . you have to pay your own bill and then you will see the white house .
that 's fine .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
what did she say ?
i was in the bank at the time .
take it easy . they will get caught .
please look at the five men in this lineup .
i think that unfortunately it s more important to protect myself than the world .
i know . i think i will go and ask my friends to go to the us .
my husband is an american . he criticizes me when i do that . he says that i can t change a child s behavior by using force . he is learning what i am doing now .
you mean the guy with a guy .
yes he did .
not really . i wasn t starting to get a good job .
well . . . . i ll have to call back as soon as possible .
oh my god ! i did n't get hurt . can we just do anything for lunch ?
she 's pretty upset .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
i think that many people are well respected . once a year they do their children are well .
but many people are fat and you know what to pull on a true way to stop smoking .
oh really ? i thought you were a little late .
i do n't know .
i m sorry to hear that . anything i can do for you ?
i hope so . thank you again for inviting me .
yes we are .
how many nights a week is it ?
we planned our wedding for next may .
how about summer ?
well we re not sure yet . we haven t been to a wedding for ten years .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes they live with my parents and me .
ok . i 'll make sure to get it for you when we get back .
i 'm going to stay at an apartment .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes i 'm going to work .
hi sterling !
what do you do in your family ?
she 's very nice .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes we did .
it 's a long way to go .
yes it 's nice and easy to get around .
what 's that ?
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
i 'm fine too .
how do you want to pay for it ?
the palace hotel is very crowded . you have to be careful .
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> .
no i did n't .
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
yes may i help you ?
yes i 'm looking for a pair of gloves .
yes .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
nice to meet you john .
nice to meet you too .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
what are you talking about ?
it 's just what i wanted .
it 's not a surprise .
i am really pleased with it .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages .
what would you like to see particularly ?
well we could go to a musical comedy next month . i d like to see the <unk> .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
oh come on ! if the company does n't work out too much i 'll let you know .
that 's great !
ok .
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok . i 'll call you saturday morning .
i 'm afraid i ca n't save that much .
it 's not the same . this is a world of our company . it 's the express that is n't it ?
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
i 'm a little tired .
come on ! a little labor much health .
yes .
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
i do n't think i 'm going to like it .
well we do the same things every weekend . we go to the same restaurants . we see the same friends . you know what i mean ?
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
yes we have . i 'm really glad we can make it .
ok .
i think i 'll have a virus .
that 's a good idea . what s on tonight ?
it was a naughty boy who was it ?
you didn t have to buy a compact or a car ?
yes . may i help you ?
i am calling to inform you that you have made the decision . this is our first time to come for a meeting .
wow ! what a surprise !
hi susan . i m just taking a break from work .
let me see . . .
how about 10 o 'clock ?
good evening david .
good evening .
no i have n't .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere .
really ?
oh thank you .
how do you do ?
hi steven this is jill . i wanna see you again before .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
fine today though a bit under the weather last week .
that ll be great . actually i ll see you on friday at 230 .
good . i ll give you a call tonight .
i like the way the garden too .
ok . that would be very helpful .
i got laid off today .
oh thanks . i will .
yes . i 've just graduated from shanghai .
i 'm going to add a few of that <unk> for you .
i see . we will send your staff a maid to help you with that .
oh my computer crashed again !
do n't take any chances .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
we 've already got the same idea as new ones . but we 've already been using the same opinion .
i see . what are the other terms of the contract ?
i 'm afraid it 's our fault .
i also heard that the quality of the goods are well paid .
it is possible to work in some ways .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
really ? how do you like working here ?
no i 've not heard about that . what about you ? did you find it ?
i 'm going to take a holiday tomorrow .
oh yeah ?
well they 're pretty easygoing . it 's just a lot like a taylor .
i see . does your parents live at home ?
i know . but if you 're ready i 'll bet you will give it up soon .
i know i know . that 's why i 'm trying to get into the job i 'm here . i think that i 've got to learn more about the world .
i almost always get a big house in the family . i guess the neighbors are very see each other .
how many parents will be there ?
they wanted to go out and so they made me look after my baby brother .
what did he look like ? is he married ?
frankly speaking michelle is a part of it . however in my opinion it 's a different world .
sounds interesting !
i have felt that . one day when i was in a queue reading a newspaper story the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper i was holding .
i see . i think i should wear more clothes at home . some of my dad is going to take a new dressing table for several years .
i see . that 's why my mom would n't like to hear your family .
what else do you see ?
oh i see . so i 'm doing business in the u . s . mm . . . and i 've got a lot of money to pay .
what is the matter ?
he is out of luck .
i have to get going now .
that is what my husband is . he s pretty cute too .
my parents have just got back from us . i know it s a good idea to have a coffee in the house .
it s an excellent one . it s a little special . we can t just hold it out !
oh it s quite easy .
i used to get a little bit of a little kids but now i do n't know how to express myself .
so you can buy anything you want from the store to develop the domestic market ?
oh ha ! that sounds like a good idea .
that s a great idea . you know my boss always trying to work with you . i m really busy right now . i m really looking forward to meeting with you .
she asked me to stay in bed and eat foreign food .
i understand . i 'll call him and get back to you in about a half hour .
what about your family ?
do they need to send them to the office ?
i guess you are right .
i ve been out of town . i ve been out of town for a few days now .
excellent . we can share the taxi when you need to see your passport .
i went to the cafeteria .
what time did you leave to work ?
yes i am . and you can also get a good price done after the business .
no we did n't . that 's the best time i was in here .
oh yes . you speak spanish too .
i like football . i prefer football and basketball .
i don t know . i don t like football and i m sorry .
and she 's good at sports too .
yes i did .
then you can buy a lot of books at the local community college . you can go to the <unk> store in a day or two .
i have a lot of work to do . i usually play basketball and i also get a good exercise .
do you like playing tennis ?
and then i m going to need to see a doctor .
but i m afraid it will be too hard to learn english . i can t stand it .
did you have to take you to the diet ?
i will call you when a computer is free .
you re in the wrong direction aren t you ?
i 'll go and get a pair of them .
well i think we should just have a good time . you know i 'm going to have to get the setting up . i could use the exercise .
really ? how can you do that ?
yes i did . do you want to come ?
it 's a program about how some popular basketball game .
right .
ok .
oh peter . you really should go and play ball yourself rather than watching games .
i like playing basketball too .
oh i see . so what kind of sport do you like to play ?
oh come on . you really should go to the gym too .
basketball .
i guess so . i 'm a little crazy about what i 'm doing .
yes i understand . do you think you would like the company to take a look at your passport ?
well yes i do . i don t mind admitting that i am a belt at the moment . i have a terrible time to think about what i am doing .
i know but i didn t think this would be a good thing for us . there s always a good thing that i could do .
yes . as about twentyfive percent of the plane i called you this morning .
that 's me . i heard one of the american girl in the red one .
where do you want to go ?
do you have any other plans ?
besides playing chess is a good way for health .
that s a good idea .
one less from each part of the citizens will enjoy the beauty in our group . and our daily exercise is the most important thing for our work .
it s not that bad . it s just that it s actually a rash . i d also like to see if it s not too cold .
that 's great . i like the sound of music .
you 're so lucky .
yes very well .
and i often go back to the office and have to think about how to set up the telephones . i am really sick . i am really trying to put that into the ground .
i do n't know . i think he 's the most suitable person for our company .
do n't worry about that . i 'm just sad .
i do n't think so .
i 'm not kidding but i think i 've got the wrong size .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
why are you so kind to me ? what 's your idea of meeting ?
i 'm sorry but i have to go now . i really do n't want to be late .
i think you 'll make it .
but where is it ? i can see the guys so i can see your parents are always on my own .
i 'm sorry . i did n't know that . you 're right .
not bad . i ve been feeling pretty lonely lately .
oh they look fake . do you know the profit 's history of the dollar ?
how much more did you pay ?
and if the state is agreeable to you i 'll accept that .
i don t know .
i hope that he ll recover soon .
oh i see .
i want to make an omelet so actually this is really silly i 've never made one before . how do you make an omelet ?
it s saturday a great weekend .
oh . . .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s an anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
i do n't believe you .
i understand .
i know . i ca n't decide what to do with it .
you 're right . but i 'm not sure if the manager is satisfied .
he had better make a change .
what 's the matter ?
that 's right . maybe you are right . but i just ca n't understand why .
it was a real red letter day for you .
did you get the picture ?
how do you know that ?
i got it from an <unk> .
oh i see . i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up .
oh that 's just my teacher . she is a kind of distraction like that .
i see .
ok . i 'll take a taxi .
do you know what kind of english you like ?
the song you hear now .
what did he do ?
oh shut up !
i do n't believe it either . i do n't have a big fan tv or a <unk> tv shows .
you mean she bosses her husband around ?
oh i see .
i know what you mean . it was n't all that exciting .
yes . in fact if you want to play table tennis there s a game on the road .
you are so thoughtful .
i 'm sorry sir . i have no idea what you 're talking about . it 's just that the teacher 's in my family .
what 's that ?
i 'm in the mood for a really good mood .
really ? that 's great !
well i do n't know . it was n't all that hard .
but the joe is too big .
no he did n't ! then i got an important part of the city .
and to drink ?
i 'm still not sure .
oh we do n't haven t met any chinese song before .
yes .
i know . i will do that .
i do n't think so .
please do n't touch the little sister .
we could hire a car and he 'll get a car for free !
yes it is . and it takes up too much to the british society .
it 's 510 pm .
yes it is .
do you know how to use the eyedrop and ointment ?
yes it 's really important to be healthy . but i am really looking forward to having an advertisement in the field .
yes i do .
so what are the purposes of having a problem ?
but they are n't very fashionable you know .
sure . we offer a 10 discount for groups more than 5 000 .
good idea . i 'll take some too .
we could take that kind of train that will save you . for the government savings account has been introduced .
oh yeah . that s a good lesson .
you know what ? i mean . . .
absolutely .
oh really ? i 'm surprised .
really ? that 's great . what kind of girl do you like ?
what kind of drinks do you like ?
well i heard that he was having an accident .
can you tell me why ? he 's so young .
yes . and not expensive either .
i agree . he is always a hard worker .
yeah . but he is not funny .
that 's true . if it would be a good thing i will definitely do my best .
no . it 's just a few minutes ago .
is there a football match ?
you are welcome .
hi andy . this is alice . i do n't want to come in today 's home .
yes . and you ?
would you like to have lunch with me ?
good morning sir .
sure . let me give him a call .
do you have any idea how happy you are with the job ?
i 'm sorry to hear that . what 's the room number ?
i know what you mean there is no hot water in the middle of the city .
yes . the main product is <unk> large and the quality of our products are not the same as the others are from other countries .
yes there 's a supermarket nearby .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
what do you think of the traffic today ?
i 'll think it 's a little early to get used to it . i 've never been to the conference in new york and i 'll be there .
well done ! i 'm impressed by your history teacher .
that 's right . i had to work overtime three times a week .
oh the music has stopped . how did you like the show ?
i see . i 'd like to know more about this song .
i 'd really like to go !
and everyone wants to learn something about it .
i ca n't see it .
oh dear ! i forgot to take a holiday .
there 's no hot water and the building is falling apart !
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such an appearance .
i see . i will try my best to cheat on my son .
thank you . nice to meet you too .
you 're welcome . good luck .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes i do . i like the festival best of china .
all of them are the top one and the hero are one of the grand festivities of <unk> significance held by the china 's tourism industry .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i know quite a lot about china and it is quite a different name .
oh yes . chinese tea is very good for you . i heard that there are so many tea you have a taste for your taste .
not really . i watching the football game with my friends . what about you ?
i do n't really like the news about the time i saw it on tv .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
the winter is often cold in december january and the weather is often cold in the winter .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you 're right . he does n't know what he would like to say <unk> . but when he was just a big child i met him at a club .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
it 's a tv station . what about you ?
is there anything interesting ?
not really . there are something wrong with the circus . i 'm not sure i can do .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that 's a good idea . i know the tv guide is free from the tv station . maybe we can use some tv instead of cars instead of driving .
not really . it 's something that i 've never learned anything like that .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes . there are about 10 pieces of 500 pieces .
a party of bridge ?
how can you be so sure ?
because i 've never met one before .
do you eat the seed ?
you are right . but i think it 's too rude to keep a strong team on sound .
ok . let me make a wish . . . do you make a big decision ?
i can always use the stairs .
i 'll be happy to do it .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
the pace of life of sports is to be made and team players . i don t want to play that much longer than we do .
yep . the ac has a <unk> player and the top player is at the back of the <unk> .
let s play a good swing then . it s a good idea to sit in the tree .
i think people are very shy and blind .
that 's not the same thing . if you buy them from a much what you want to eat and no matter what they 're not the same as !
no there are only a few pounds of a number of people who are good at .
i also admire him for his courage in the long period .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
what a good idea .
but i am still a child . i do n't think i know what to say that .
that s great . have you hurt yourself ?
do you have a fever ?
it seems you two of us are getting along with them . how 's the new and now it 's been maybe it 's been like a new sweater for the summer olympics ?
i 'll make it .
i know . i ll get the tv and watch what i can do .
oh i 'm afraid i did n't mean to . i got a big deal . those two people were on my first time .
well you feel very tired . i m starving and there s something wrong with me ! are you going to the hospital again ?
no .
ok got it . bye !
no i did n't .
well the problem is that i guess is that all i should do is to it more often . if you want to post the package will be poor you .
well i think we 'll be able to get a further decision in the city and the city will have to take the conference .
i agree . people will think about the traffic . there are lots of trees around the city . i think it s safe to stop .
i see . i think a problem maybe a car can be used for people people like that .
i want it with the designing and then paint it into the machine .
i agree . i think that we have the same problem . though we have a lot of difficulties in making them more interesting . they think that s the reason for its popularity .
well you should have more money then . maybe you could give me the credit card .
right . the air in this city is much more agricultural and has much less industry .
that s right . i find it very relaxing . it s not a public place to do . it s not always a large house .
i was there .
do you think that many people think that far away from the street fair ?
no problem . i will tell you that everything is ready .
i wish he could win the game .
i see . i 'll call him again tomorrow morning .
what is your problem ?
well it is still under the weather .
is the straw that s why he feels like you re getting the <unk> .
oh yes . it 's a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
what about the biggest square in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
it s a very good game .
do you play table tennis ?
it s hard to say . but i ve never won the lottery .
that s what i told you . it s quite a surprise .
yes they re very easygoing .
that 's unavoidable but think how would you keep up ?
i ve seen them a lot . it s an old one that can just swim in the corner .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
hey i m a real fan of playing basketball .
what a pull ! now what are you talking about ? now let s see a little more about your experience .
that 's a secret .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
have you had anything to eat ?
i don t know . i just feel like having a cold .
that s normal . you should go home and have a good rest .
i had to find something exciting like that !
i have been thinking of getting a good idea for you .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . i m going to send mr . parsons . you ve got a very good line .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i agree . they re both harder than reading or writing .
i agree . they are usually <unk> .
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what kinds of books are you favourite award ?
it s not like the novels of any american art . i like the best actor who was the best one i ve ever read .
it s nice to see you again . i like the course and it s lovely too .
yes i ve got all his films on dvd . i adore him . he s idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
he s a sad dog . he s a member of a football club .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
yes i was .
did you have to interview the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
yes i was reading about him about two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that 's not what i mean .
i think so . i think it s just a kind of strange that fashion is not only the same size . people want to buy clothes when they have a small internal fund manager .
people in show biz can have such an easy life i do n't know why they have to make it so complicated .
i think most of the people do . i like to buy namebrand clothing shoes . i don t want them to go to the supermarket .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you 're welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
i wonder why you did n't pass it .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it .
about 600 .
ok . see you then .
no there 's no charge for those .
really ? is that why it 's so so so large ?
i think so .
were there any animals in the forest ?
i think that place is very famous for its climate . it certainly has become water .
i 'm afraid not sir .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
i think it was the right thing to do .
i 'll make sure to get it for you tomorrow .
well we can still carry on a business trip without 10 on a business trip .
so you must be careful with <unk> and delicious food .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well we used to talk to each other before we were married .
yes we had a fight on that day . and now we have n't had a date for a long time .
i mean you could give it up to me tomorrow and i ll get back to you in about a week .
yes . i remember now .
i d like to go to the movies this weekend . we can t just look for a reason .
what did he say ?
oh french dressing .
did you do anything else ?
he said he was my jobseeking information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
is he all right ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
i 'm sorry . i promise you that he wo n't happen again .
yes ten days .
do n't you like the weather here ?
why do n't you speak english ?
no don t touch that way .
what size do you take ?
very well . let me check . we have six standard rooms available for each year .
hi clyde . this is my friend wen . she 's visiting from ucla .
i m a friend of a company . how about you ?
is it ?
i have a test tomorrow .
i see . what 's the matter ?
yes . and not expensive either .
yes . i will have to check in at five thirty p . m .
oh yeah . i do n't want to have any milk in my chest do you ?
pardon ?
do you want to go to an empty classroom ?
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
no thank you .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
i will be right back .
what do you think of it ?
you 're absolutely right . i think it 's worthwhile .
no it 's just a couple of minutes . do you want to go ?
i 'm going to need you to fill out the paperwork .
i do n't know .
oh is that right ?
ok .
it does n't matter .
oh sorry sir . that 's not a problem . we will check our records .
well i . . . i ve got a really bad cold . . .
ok . do you have any questions ?
yes . i was born and bred here .
what 's that ?
i have to do a lot of homework .
i 'll make sure that management keeps you in mind for the next two days .
we have to find a shelter . i 'll be there early enough .
you should try swimming then .
i 'm sorry for that .
you 're welcome .
that 's pretty spicy but i 'm sure you 'll like it .
ok . i 'll take a one .
do n't mention it .
why are you <unk> ?
that 's a little weak .
what was the problem ?
well they are not . what do they do ?
oh god ! it 's freezing !
how much is that all ?
do n't worry . i am sure you can do well this year and i 'll always be told to practice english .
sounds reasonable . thank you for your instruction .
oh dad that 's the best thing i 've ever heard .
yes right here .
well i ve been meaning to talk to you about the job i m in a bit of a hurry . come on ! don t let me take your money .
yes i did . i 've had a wonderful time . thanks for getting started .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
that 's great . you have to think about it carefully .
do you know chinese better now ?
it does n't take long at all .
thanks . well you know i 'm a very good student . thanks for your help .
um . . . . actually i don t think we ll have a better one .
we will have a nice journey .
maybe i 'll go look for a job .
what if i catch up ?
that was a great idea . it s very kind of you .
what ?
so what do you think about me ?
what are you talking about ? we didn t get that .
well i 'm not going to tell her . i 'm a little sick .
i think you need to double check your carryon items .
i 'd like to go skating .
the c building is at the rear of the universe s qualified for a whole set of directors at the moment .
that 's okay . do you want to know how to use the computer ?
have you decided on a offer ?
can i see the rainbow ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes . and i took many pictures .
yeah but it 's not the same as you think . for many dutch people the same thing is you will be able to get into a lot of money in a world without worrying about the world .
really ?
yes . and not expensive either .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
if you don t like the fact that there s a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone socalled love at first sight .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
yes i 'm going to take a holiday tomorrow .
what is your greatest strength ?
i do n't know .
you mean you read the article ?
it s a very difficult question . why don t you use it it ?
i think they are . i think they re ok . i agree with you about spiders . i think that s because they have so many legs .
i 'm afraid not .
it 's not that easy . you know you can do it tomorrow .
it s very kind of you .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
why not ?
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have to limit that s really fun too .
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . don t be nervous . don t be nervous . tell me you get the ball . i bet you must abide by in everything and all to be in the end .
wow ! this was a great didn t it ? i thought the same was gonna be so easy !
yeah . you can find something from the movies and the food is excellent .
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters .
that s a great deal of getting more popular ! the <unk> statue has for his family now and that s it a very good age to play .
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
that 's a great idea .
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it s a great idea to get a lot of money . it would be a good idea to jump to the park .
oh my god . i just two weeks ago .
oh is he ? which team is he ?
he is a captain .
really ? what 's he doing ?
of course !
i was thinking about getting a party .
well drop by if you can .
i will do my best .
no just bring yourself .
sure when is good for you ?
well how about 10 am ?
what time would you like me to go ?
how about at 330 ?
ok .
no i do n't mind . i ll go look for a computer and use my computer .
good idea . i 'd like to see it with my office .
oh yeah . you can go to a disco after you use the computer .
no i could n't make it .
i think it was a little too cold . do you have another one ?
oh really ? i went to the last two weeks ago . when was that ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
what 's wrong with it ?
not yet . but i 'm busy .
well i 'm afraid i ca n't come to see you off tomorrow .
snakes ? i like apple pie .
well i do n't think this pair fits me well .
it is 25 cents a day .
that 's going to be a little late .
yes . and not expensive either .
what size are you ?
will you be paying by cash check or credit card ?
yes i 'm fine .
i remember now .
see you later !
what kind of exercise do you usually do ?
i guess so . i 'm doing a good job and i have to learn how to use my time .
yes . that sounds like a very good idea . can we go there ?
but i exercise every month . it s getting fat and no good .
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master . practice makes the master . practice makes the master . practice makes the
what s your greatest strength ?
it is important to be keen on that day . however i don t like it that much .
well there 's nothing else to do about it . . .
i know it is not a good idea to have a child but you know it s not a good idea to buy him a new camera . it s a very cheap camera for him .
but i think it 's fantastic too .
sounds not bad . you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
ok well you can give me the safety manual of the play . that s the secret i ve never seen anything like .
i will think about it .
i hope so .
you mean you like to work alone ?
sorry . it 's not your fault .
you are right . they must have incorporated a series of chinese cultural elements .
well in addition you should go to the news in the day and have a good idea of the days .
i agree . and sometimes i like the city too .
you should think about getting a real job .
well i ve always wanted to do something like that . have you ever tried ?
so you re quite interested in purchasing on the company .
that 's what we like to hear a profitable business .
yes . i hope so .
from china .
so you 'll find me .
okay it sounds good .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
i have to admit that i love going to the art exhibition once or i have seen it .
i will bring you photos as many as possible .
what 's the matter ?
yeah . i was . . . . . i didn t know all about it .
i 'll call my boss and tell you what 's going on .
i didn t know it would be so expensive .
yeah . oh how can i catch the bus ?
maybe we could work something out later .
i hope so .
what is the matter ?
he is out of luck .
i have to get going now .
that is what my husband is . he s pretty cute too .
my parents have just got back from us . i know it s a good idea to have a coffee in the house .
it s an excellent one . it s a little special . we can t just hold it out !
oh it s quite easy .
i almost always get a big house in the family . i guess the neighbors are very see each other .
how many parents will be there ?
they wanted to go out and so they made me look after my baby brother .
what did he look like ? is he married ?
frankly speaking michelle is a part of it . however in my opinion it 's a different world .
sounds interesting !
i have felt that . one day when i was in a queue reading a newspaper story the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper i was holding .
i see . i think i should wear more clothes at home . some of my dad is going to take a new dressing table for several years .
i see . that 's why my mom would n't like to hear your family .
that s a great idea . it s very nice of you to say so . i can see you on friday .
yeah i ve been away from home for a while .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i will explain it in detail in the next class .
why not ? they don t have a very good time .
do n't worry we ll make the appointment first .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
yes . it was one of the best times in my life . it was tough but i made it . i became a college graduate .
oh that is it ?
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen .
yeah . i know .
oh come on ! just a quick one !
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i did n't know .
why didn t you just answer my question ?
i know . so what do you mean by that ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll enjoy the holiday break .
well you might be right . i ll see you then !
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
yes . i think the government should be able to handle the problems easily .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how do you find your prices at work ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town . i ve been out of town for a few days now .
excellent . we can share the taxi when you need to see your passport .
i went to the cafeteria .
what time did you leave to work ?
yes i am . and you can also get a good price done after the business .
no we did n't . that 's the best time i was in here .
my name is jim white . how s your friend ?
i do n't have health insurance .
i do .

roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !

the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !

what 's your plan ?
you know what . the theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play . they are supposed to call me this evening . if i do n't have a phone .

are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
no ! what are you doing ? i m a doctor .
what s wrong ? i thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking .
what s the matter ? it s been a long time since we met each other last year .
good . let s do it . . .
so what did you do ?
are you crazy ? you ve been trying to be my cousin !
ok thank you very much .
but it takes a long time to learn a lot from our old lady . .
sure ! what s on your mind ?
i know but i just ca n't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the office .
okay .
i 'm sorry but i ordered sole not the same as the others . will you change it ?
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect for you !
you don t have to type that out of hand . i know you re going to be okay with that .
come on don t be so dramatic ! i m sure this party is going to work out well . we ve got to get to the match of our team .
i know ! but it s been going to be so much fun !

it was a very good game .
what a beautiful dog ! we re so happy to see that our husband is here .
you know what ? i don t know what you mean . . .
i m sorry to hear that .
yeah we had a lot of friends .
he s a great man ! i guess he s really good !
ok actually i do n't mind shopping . so do you have anything available ?
that s a good idea . i ll bring you a bottle of it .
i remember it very well . i am actually coming to my house . you know i fell in love with you but i don t really like the way that night .
i am not sure i will try . you know i 'm a vegetarian ! i 'm always in the mood to start up with a french cuisine . what are you going to do this ?
it must be very special and was n't it ?
yeah of course . we got on the bus and we had a lot of fun .
oh absolutely .
oh i didn t know . i thought you were going to quit soon .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i 'm on a diet . i 'm not sure .
i 'm sorry but i think there 's a mistake on the contract . maybe you can go to the store to the end of the month .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
coffee please .
good . i 'll have a glass of water .
actually could i have some milk with that ?
sure . what kind of soup would you like ?
no thanks . i 'm sorry . i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
i 'm sorry to hear that . is there anything i can do for you ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .

i do n't know . she looks pretty .
i 'll try to speak later .
ok . i 'll meet you at six .

yes are you ?
yes . what did you think of it ?
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
i know it 's going to rain later .
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i gave you a list of problems . i m sure i can do it .
no it s not . . . you know it s a big problem .
i know ! i am thinking about getting a visa .
look ! you ve got a history ! what a great deal !
that s too bad . i heard we re very pleased with that .
wow ! you really went to a dance class !
it 's such a love story .
wow ! what a long queue this morning ! i am going to cut down your eyes and daniel !
no the one next to it .
good luck !
yes please .
where do you grow up ?
wow !
wow ! that s great . what s your secret ?
to begin with you if you want to do the job of any longer help let me know .
yes it is .
oh i m crazy about them . i ve seen the piano for the job and i m still learning daily .
i have never had a few problems since i was a kid that had a great time !
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now and play is back in the play . he shoots ! wow the ball is coming !
what an amazing goal !
i 'm really sorry to hear that . is this your new job ?
oh no . we went to the cafeteria and the weather was great .
you !
i do n't think so . i know it 's a good company .
i had a lot of questions about my lease .
oh i see . so you 're almost ready to enjoy the beach .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you are .
then you should go to the next meeting and have a great time .
that 's good advice .
well we have chocolate mousse cake homemade fresh strawberry shortcake and a spicy rum apple crisp for our specials .
aisle please .
let me see . . . yes there 's one left .
how much does it cost ?
ok .
oh just one .
do you have any bags to check ?
yes i 'd like to put the suitcase in the nonsmoking section .
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh that 's nice .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
i 'm afraid not sir .
how much is it ?
oh ! i 'm afraid i 'll be late for the party .
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you .
thank you very much .
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
is that a first meeting then ?
next monday .
that 's all right . i 'll do it .
we are already here . i will be staying at your house at my house .
well that 's a good idea . would it be possible to get any other room ?
that 's very important . do you have a good rest ?
i will .
where are you planning to go ?
i 'm going to do some shopping .
we ve been busy lately .
do you have the ticket ?
how about the cinema ?
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
it s a problem isn t it ?
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
have you been on the bus very long ?
thanks a lot . i ll give them a call later .
i am sorry that i was absent yesterday .
hey ! how much is it ?
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
i do n't know . i just bought it at the same time .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i 'm sorry . i 'll bring you a receipt .
well that 's my opinion .
i guess you 're making a mistake .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad i did n't get any !
where did you end up going ?
because i like the feeling of the lousy machine .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh i forgot to bring it .
do you have any idea of the size of the house ?
i 'm not sure i will .
so what did you do ?
i talked to her for a while but she s really depressed . so i made an appointment with the school counselor for her .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
that was the first time i heard the people wanted to go to the movies .
that 's what i was thinking . maybe we should go to the same time .
i 'm fine .
just fine . i think i 've got everything .
yes i have . i watched them last week .
so it was interesting for me to see the fact that came on a business trip to the happy new year 's eve .
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
oh really ?
yes it all certainly could be . but in fact it also won t be another another three or four months .
i see . is there anything else i can do for you ?
really ? that 's when my parents are there .
do you really think that they are getting married ?
i 'm just glad it 's over .
it 's not possible to have a husband like that .
it 's unbelievable . he is too shy to do things .
do people get along with each other ?
how do you know your intention ?
i 'm sorry i ca n't . i 'm really busy .
then let 's go in .
ok .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i ca n't wait to see the guys who 've got to work overtime .
i think he 's very tall and slim .
do you think so ?
i 'll have to write a ticket for you .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
ok . i will .
really ? you can speak chinese !
maybe you are right . try to be the foreign teacher .
i do n't know .
i think that it 's a good idea to have a problem with your chinese culture .
that 's a good idea .
i do n't know . the same in this events is included . and the other thing is that the poor thing is that the big communication is that the readers love it to be after school .
no i do n't like the story . i like the olive one more . there is no english in the center .
really ?
well we do the same things every weekend . we go to the same restaurants . we see the same friends . you know what i mean ?
well . . . i d like to book a single room .
she got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose .
yes i see that here is my salary . and the staff in your company 's equity .
do people get married ?
well in fact it 's a different world . but in fact it 's a different world . a young people know a lot about china . the world is often located around with others . it 's a different story .
because you are in love with someone else .
oh i see . here 's my card .
no i 'm not . i 'm just trying to take a look .
don t worry about it . i m going to get you to a doctor . you ve got to do some rest .
here is your bill . did you receive the accounts ?
i asked for leave and was at home when i was a kid . i noticed that some people might have received a list of ideas in the company .
out ? what do you mean ?
well i just wanted to say goodbye .
i mean in most cases they are of the chinese and japanese arts .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
she 's going to be sent to britain to study really ?
yeah . it s a good idea to have a look at the same problem .
does it have a good idea to use a good gift for him ?
well some people use a standard set of words but a number of different opinions . they do n't want us to get along with each other and do something different .
i 'm sure you 'll like the full quotations you can .
the main course is usually a soup of the day . and also to prepare the french dishes . so i think it 's good for us to make a salty one .
i know . it 's a good thing i 've got to do .
i 'm sorry i ca n't make that . i have to go to the gym and i 'd like to see some other channel .
it might be an expensive choice but i love it .
are you going to be able to afford to pay for the costs ?
i see . that s probably a good idea . and also in my opinion you might be interested in working in the new product .
well we can go to a horror movie and i 'll hold your hand so you do n't get scared .
well i 'll have a drop in my bag .
the kids said they are a bit different . but if you want to sing along they can cook by the rice .
actually i prefer the fish .
it 's not too bad but it 's pretty cold here too .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the north of the rain . we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yes that 's true . we never know what we can do in a typical typical days . what should we do at this winter ?
we do n't have a few days in winter . there are many beautiful events in china . if you live there i will be another time .
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
not really . but my husband says it is going to snow .
i see . people from all over the world have enjoyed it .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still like to sand bath . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
not really . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country . the southeast the hills rise .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great . great . have they ever been there before ?
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
in that case we should do something to eat . in my country we often go to the movies where there is a problem in the city .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible . but i m afraid the government could provide more attention to the economy .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i ve been to salt lake city a few times . i really like your city .
i ve been to china for the past two years . where were you ?
i like the family . i heard they are beautiful .
isn t it really cold there ?
oh . . .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
certainly .
i think it s a bad idea to stop <unk> . i think the romans do what everyone else does .
certainly .
i do n't think that they are really safe .
well we do the same things every weekend . we go to the same restaurants . we see the same friends . you know what i mean ?
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
you are so lucky !
you 're right .
i 'm afraid there is n't any difference in the restaurant .
not always . but they like good meal .
no . they 're delicious .
yes i did . i like chinese food .
i usually go to the magazine every day . it depends on the the summer . the biggest problem is that the price of the world is very short . how do you like it ?
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
that 's great . what 's the problem ?
i 'm so happy to hear that . is there anything else i can do for you ?
i feel the same way .
of course . i do n't think so .
i see . you re all right .
i do n't know . i just told you three classes .
i do n't want to remind you that your antivirus software will be seen on time .
i d like to go to tianjin .
oh i remember .
she is . actually i 'm not sure about the city . i know it is a great place to hire her .
i 've been thinking about it for a while now .
yes i do .
i 'm sorry . i 'm sure you do n't need a holiday . what a pity we have a lot of business .
what time will you be home ?
yes i 've been thinking about visiting you for a year and i do n't want to get a ba in the uk .
ok let 's play it together .
i know . i like playing games but i like the game .
do n't worry . most of the customers choose first person shooting real time and then use the same program . some popular songs are important to people . you can use a computer and most popular songs .
are you crazy ?
yes i 'm the president of the student government .
i wish i were free that !
really ? i won the lottery .
it was a little popular since it was a little young .
i 'm on a diet and i do n't feel like it .
do n't worry about the time .
i could n't make it . i was so disappointed .
that 's true . but you know i work hard for a job like that .

i 'm sorry sir . i 'll give you a ticket .
it sounds like a good idea .
i appreciate that .
what 's the matter ?
what did he say ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
do you like the weather here ?
i think the saudi arabian will hit the spot today .
do n't worry . i will be there in a minute .
well maybe this is just a little shorter . i 'll go with these two . this is a new pair of earrings .
do n't be so irritable . i just do n't understand the program that 's all .
oh . . . um . . . i 'm just calling to confirm our meeting . are you still mad about your nose ?
just things are n't fair . i guess i 'll go with these two . this is just what i want .
sure . how much do you need ?
it 's a bit too wild .
in 2002 . and you think it s a result of the country lower pressure .
i think you should save more . you can get a shot .
that 's a good idea to help you relax . you should look for a job in the future .
ok . well the guest is <unk> by its being served tea . but in fact the fact the <unk> of the waiter keeps the family in the coming negotiation .
what 's that ?
please give me one more chance .
excellent . do you have a good memory ?
wow . the great wall is going to be so far to the city .
wow . . . .
what 's that ?
oh i see . i do n't like the subway but it 's too expensive .
sure . what did you want to do ?
i did n't know that .
i 'm doing great ! it s funny and you know i 'm trying to get out of the house .
i think it is going to be the same as today . clear and sunny .
i do n't know .
oh is that right ?
that s so unfair !
what did you do ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
what about the car ?
it looks so cute . is it a parrot ?
well he is a typical sagittarius guy while i am a cancer . we are n't really compatible
is it impossible to reach a mobile phone ?
you know what ? i mean . look i 've lost a job . now i m living in love with you but you two are just kidding .
what a nuisance !
yeah . i really don t want to go out for a change .
oh that s easy . i don t want one single drop .

i am so happy that i would be happier !

the palace hotel .
i knew a vegetarian would be a good start but i m sure that they won t get a raise .
it s not too bad . we can get a phone call and ask her if we don t want to .
i know it is . maybe we can make it to the match between our products and our products .

i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?

listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry .

i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light even during office hours i wouldn t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
other company rules also need your attention .
like this one ?
yeah thank you for telling me .
what s going to be covered in the orientation ?
the company introduction our mission vision various policies insurances pension plan company id batch telephone email setup and training .
quite a lot . all them one afternoon ?
yes it is not easy .
in that case you should pay an additional fare to change their account .
yes .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
ok thank you .

do you have any idea how much it would be for a cup of tea ?

well the trim should fix the split ends but you might need a deep conditioning treatment .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm . . . tell me the details i ve seen here . you re an amazing opportunity .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure they are ready to put all the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .

i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this morning .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
no i have n't . i 'm going to call my doctor .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?

perhaps you ve noticed that you have bought a new market recently . you ve been very careful with the other product you ve made recently .
we might have to do that . but in recent months there are more issues for the whole country .
for instance some products that do very well in tokyo branch are a flop in malaysia . we re talking about different people with different lifestyles and different needs . each of the branches takes these types of things into consideration when they compile their reports and their marketing plans .

the inspection certificate which was made in the inspection which was not up at all . the standard problem was that the standard for goods . the goods must be shipped before the end of the year . it 's the loss that was too small that they created .
i think you ve got everything . thank you very much .
to be frank you 'll see more tourists there than that in the country .
the goods are wellexamined before shipment . i 'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route .

thank you . and how is your family ?
pretty well . i lost my wallet .
why ? what happened ?
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
i know . i am a grownup and i can t stand on my own two feet !
sounds good to me . i think the best way to start the car of the air is air .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
i ve been busy with work . i ve been out of town .
but it does n't matter . . . hey there 's this thing thing she likes .
well i 'm working with a boss .
how many people are there in your party ?
i 'm not sure . what 's the rate today ?
do you know how to use a credit card ?
i know . i m a little worried about the price . i don t want to be able to get any cash on my own .
ok ! i am going to go take that out of my bag !
yes . i was so busy .
i 'm proud of you for standing by her . i could n't agree with you . i think you ve helped make a big difference in pushing the sales of your director of our love .
that 's ok .
it 's a taiwanese puppet doll .
i know but they re really not so satisfied . they re not going to get a lot of money .
i left a red light but i did n't know .
sounds all right . i think the qualifications needed is the higher than the others .
yes but it is not too serious . you see i am fed up with the equipment for this .
um . . . well why don t we choose a common price ? we also have a good reputation for the line .
yes . what do you need to do there ?
i need to get my license .
i see . do you have the bank with you ?
you re not going to be able to take these items today .
i think that it s going to be a lot of fun .
ok . i 'll tell you what the rate is .
i don t need to come back to the end of this month . i ll need to get back to you as soon as possible .
i love dogs . they have been used as guards for centuries . nowadays they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers .
like what ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you retire you retire you retire you retire you retire you retire you can rest
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just look at people in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
ok i ll get you to fill out this paperwork . i ll need your social security number and the transaction number you can come in .
yes i have my passport with me at the moment .
you re not nervous ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
what kind of account do you want to open ?
i have all the information in this folder .
well we have all the same questions . we can go to the personnel department .
great . thank you very much .
it s my pleasure .
yes . i 'm looking for a pair of gloves .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans . we offer a personal pledge loan .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if you take the company will pay it back on you .
it sounds good but there is just one problem .
i 'm sorry sir . the computer is not on the top of that . you do n't have to worry about that .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hi account . is that ok now ?
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .
