wow ! you 're right . they could be worse .
i 've never been to indian food as well .

well i walk every day .
in that case you want to work with less weight . you can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . five kilo weights should be enough . now it s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .
about three times a week if i can .
i would like to cancel one of my accounts .

i do n't think that it would be for us to just a tip .

it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .

would you like to go out for me to the movies or we can watch movies ?

i 've tried diets before but they 've never worked .
yes you are right . i believe they are doing great job .
they 're not only one but that 's not the main thing .
how would you consider your strengths ?
all right . i 'd like to talk to her about my ears .
6 .

let me have the babyback ribs .
ok . this model features antilock brakes airbags on both driver and passenger sides and impact collision design . but that 's not very good .
that 's great ! do you know if we have any specials today ?
in the beginning of the interview it is really helpful for all those who have been good .
yeah if you 're lucky that might rain .
i know that 's the problem . maybe his wife is a good man .
i agree . maybe you can help me to do something but i also worry about his present job .
here you are .
thanks a lot .
yes i 'm afraid we do .
i 'll have a double whiskey on the rocks .
we have all kinds of red wine and beef .
all right we 'll take one .
thank you very much .

no not yet . i just want to hair cut .
ok . do you have a nice room sir ?
good idea . the pictures are so beautiful .
certainly .
what interesting places shall we visit ?
nah ! let s go for a spin . you can try it out .
i think that is too expensive . it s worth buying a car .
how about this one ? this is 500 yuan and the same kind of material as that one .
why do you think that this would be a good move ?
certainly . take a tablecloth to her
have you decided what wine you would like ?
i want to tell you i 've put in my notice .
how would you like the steak ? rare mediumrare or welldone ?
i like it very much .
this means digital camcorders can be connected with the digital equipments you have at home like your digital tv or your computer .

you know i 'm going to quit my job and i still have to look for another one but i still need to try .
do n't worry about that . i will build your deck with a simple but if you order some other expenses i can get a discount of 3 to 6 .
that 's a good idea .
thanks a lot .
well it depends on how you want to travel . if you want a soft sleeper it will cost you about a much .
it 's very kind of you to say so .

i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .

probably not . doing that will probably take another three hours which i ca n't afford to choose .
how many nights a week is it ?

no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .

yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing .
that s even better than the real thing .

that 's not my fault . i brought you a bottle of wine .
i 'm not sure . that 's what i 'd like to do .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .

not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .

what do i do with it ?

you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
are you looking to help you ?
how about oil or spray ?
sure .
how much money do you want to transfer ?

is there a laundry service charge ?

it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
we re in a really good mood today .
mangoes ? what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
can you eat the seed ?

3 dollars .
here 's ten yuan . keep the change .
on a hill to the east of the tarsus river . you have a good view of the beautiful sunrise and sunset . you ca n't find a better home to live in .
will you get to class by then ?
that comes to four dollars and ten cents .
why are you applying for a visa ?
thank you .
hello . is there anything i can do for you ?
yeah go ahead .
thank you . and what s your name please ?
yes i 'm . i 'm just putting them in the post office .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
no problem . i 'll have to see the details again for you .
see you then .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we re right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you you you you you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop stop stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
good morning john !
wow you 're right . i thought you were going to be a bachelor party .
it was almost a big problem last night .
i 'm doing well .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
well that 's great news !
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
ok i will try my best to help you . but you know if you have any questions or call you will be available for a short period .
thank you very much .
do n't you hit it off ?
about two years now .
i believe we can stay out well .
she 's the same to us . she boss even though i 've had to get along with him .
but what if she is n't fair ?
yeah a lot of people have on the bus . if you want to take a bus 151 to the opposite direction .
why ? he used to be a hero during the olympics .
what happened ? is he hot ?
thank you .
aright . i 'll talk to you later .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
no you do ! just take the red light and then the blue line and the blue line is the perfect .
what are you doing when i do what you can t take me to the gym ?
yeah . i think we can make it . let s go !
what happens when i 'm not putting the gun on the brakes .
i can t believe it ! i ve never been going to get that position !
just listen . i 'll just stay with you . i 'll just go and get it .
some people say that history is a great way for some young people .
there are other ways to use . if you had to stop worrying about your system there will be no use for any of the machine .
i m looking for a sweater .
what s in your bag ?
i d prefer nonsmoking . how much is that going to cost ?
what s your camera ?
yes . as usual perhaps they serve as a 90 degree in our favour of the courses you have .
do you have any help ?
thank you .
so what kind of clubs do you live ?
a nice blanket and the sunshine is brand new . i like the pink one . where is the tea set ?
i m sorry . do you have any idea of how he buying them ?
wait a second please . this is the light and this is really good .
i don t think that s gonna happen .
and how much is it ?
i 'll show you how . it 's very beautiful .
luckily this is under the bathroom . i can t find it .
that s what my computer is showing .
thanks for saying so .
no problem !
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
is this salami and bologna you have here ?
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll speak to bob he 'll be able to help us .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hello i would like a room please .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes .
um ! it s right now ! i can t stand it !
fine mr . brown . this is exactly what i can do .
the bathroom plumbing is probably a very modern style . it has become part of the city . i can t wait to get anything to eat .
great that ll be fine .
it sure is . but it 's got a little mafia experience . it has a great deal .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
what size do you wear ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's no hot water after 10 at night . sometimes i like to have a hot shower before bed . especially in the winter . it feels good .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
the stove and the bathroom plumbing are messed up .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
probably we could get some new furniture . better stuff .
i have n't thought of that .
yes it has two bedrooms . that 's convenient .
can i help you with something ?
the ad says 325 plus deposit .
that s way too much .
well your books are due back two weeks .
i must be very careful about your work .
that s no good .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you please reconsider ?
okay . i ll write a receipt for you .
i m not interested in it . i ll be very busy if i can t afford it .
yes . i like cooking very much . i got this hobby when i was 12 years sold .
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yes . i like it at least . the americans never bargain for their products . i love their service . it 's a good idea to keep fit .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
do you want a plain table ?
i 'll be glad to have a look . could you show me some ?
the color is slim in cut . i am sure that they will suit me well .
you ca n't go down on the price .
you ll be lucky that might not be able to find something else like that .
well i just like being too tired . i work hard on my job .
don t worry . i ll take more clothes for you . and i d like to get a new one too .
i 'll have them bought for a half an hour and a half .
the sugar is on the table sir .
either a formal suit .
even if you don t have to buy a ring for me it will be on your cell phone .
oh you re welcome .
this is he . what can i do for you ?
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i am happy to have a home with you .
i will be at the apartment today at 6
good . i will see you then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
there 's a lot to me . i already have to go to see the museum of the whole city .
yes .
ok .
no but if you like to check out now we 'll be happy to see you .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
well i do n't know . i 'm sure the price has been reduced to it .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes sir . we have a great reputation for its help .
right this time has been a pleasure !
i know what you mean .
with so few windows how can you even see what the problems are ?
that 's a nice thing to see the dark color .
it s great . i really wanted to see it .
the best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom .
i do n't think the quality is too bright .
five . besides my parents and me there are my brother and sister .
it is ! look at these little light ? it is so beautiful and it is !
here s my card . i can t wait to check the exact time .
in the meantime is there a registered one ?
which kinds of gas do you know ?
well i 've got a perfect plan for this apartment . let 's go look for a have a look .
the garden looks so beautiful . it s very comfortable .
i thought it might be wonderful .
thank you .
that s what i m looking for .
yeah this is the property manager . what can i do for you ?
hello i am . what can i do for you ?
oh ? where do you live ?
you bet . i can live with you and your garden would be lovely but you know i 'm full of it .
let 's go to the lake over there .
i appreciate your help .
please give me your phone number and i can come back in 3 days .
i see . ok !
we have a very nice place to live in .
what do i need to do to get through with the thanks ?
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
yes i 'd like to buy a walkman . can you tell me about the models you have ?
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
yes please .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
oh i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
do you know how short you want your hair to be ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
i 'd like to see if you can but i 've got a very good picture of the things i need .
yeah right here and a pair of glasses on the left .
how about your sideburns ?
no problem . i think it 's a little tight in the waist .
what style do you want ?
i hope so . i 'm really tired of this oldfashioned style that i 'm looking for a more casual dress .
i appreciate your effort very much . the more your effort will be quite good .
no you don t need to put on your shades . do n't move your arm or <unk> .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yes i do .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
no way . i want you to cut my heart that is all in your eyes .
i see . you do n't have to worry about yourself .
i 'll just get back to you .
you mean you 've never had a boyfriend ?
oh that 's nice of you . thanks a lot .
yes . it 's very nice of you .
the <unk> is excellent .
all right . i 'll give you a speech like that too .
thank you . i have to work at the beginning of next year .
oh yes . that 's why i came here . do you want to find a place near the office ?
what do you mean ?
ok where is the shop ?
i ca n't agree to that place .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
ok let 's go check out the kitchen next .
i do but remember it always looks like we were all out of the house .
yes i have .
ok i can find a place that is wonderful .
how long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?
ok . i can go look at the kitchen next .
it would probably be very expensive .
where is it ?
did you hear the people in the paper centre ?
well i want to build a deck in my back yard .
where is it ?
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
actually the government should try to find some information about the city centre . if you go there will find a place that is not far from the home .
would you like to go out for me to the movies or we can watch movies ?
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
why do n't you make some corn ?
i prefer sea food .
that 's right . i like chinese food very much .
i 'm going to buy some vegetable and then we 'll go to the vegetables .
well it looks very nice .
i like fish .
certainly sir ! for a moment we have a wide selection of cooking dishes . may i suggest some cookies and some of different noodles ? it 's a special american art exhibition .
not yet . i 've decided to try something new . i 'm not sure if i have any more practice .
but you look quite proficient in using them now .
that 's great .
all right . chinese food is a little different from the chinese food .
you really like it .
hmm . . . you 're right . going to try it and give me a try .
many times . we can offer you a room far from the entrance . then we will ask you to do some <unk> . why do n't you come over and have a look at the menu ?
that would be very nice . thanks .
where is this new office ?
i guess we should send someone to fix it . maybe they can get something to help .
no problem .
alright . and your number ?
you 're welcome .
no .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
the price of cpu is 300 dollars above 1000 units .
we need your products .
when do you close the window ?
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
well you know i studied marketing in america . so i could get a discount on my products if i m looking for something else .
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
i want to get some too .
you ca n't go wrong with gramercy tavern . it 's famous for its food service and live jazz .
it 's a great place to work .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
that 's right . i heard that the company has imposed very hot and that was the first thing they wanted to get into the company .
yes . but i think the letter of inquiry should be written briefly . if it were true .

let me see . 200 yuan a week but smoking is not allowed .
how much do you think we should spend on more time with the roses ?
i 'd like to buy you a ticket for the concert .

alright . i 'll have to get a new one .
i 'd like to cash .
are dresses going to be on sale ?
my brother has last week .
oh . i know . but it 's my extra time to buy a ticket .
i 'm glad to hear that . you are everything that is possible for you to push the button like in a few weeks .
not bad . is there anything else i can do for you ?
i 'm glad to hear that . you 're here a little later .
here you are .
thank you very much . please fill out this paperwork .
well we 'd like to pay by cash .
here 's the receipt .
sure what do you want to know ?
i am disappointed with your work lately .
do i have to try them now ?
is that could take a long time to get there ?
anything else ?
have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?
i do n't know . but unfortunately they 're really <unk> !
yeah i guess that 's a good idea .
what ? leftovers of what and from when ?
my turn ? oh what a pity ! i ll come to the spot !
how about the jeans ?
no i 'm not . i want to try it now .
no i have n't thought that many of them . but kids like to be beautiful and fun .
yes i think that we should finish it just by the end of the week .
i 'm rather disappointed with it .
that 's it ! that 's a kind of weird !
i usually just finish my research paper and use my organizational skills .
yeah i ll start opening some time . you should start with a workout plan . anyway i ll start doing some weight first .
fortunately my body feels so much .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music .
mainly plastics . they re also very popular aren t <unk> degradable they don t break down easily and you can t use any other things at least one else .
basically we have many cookies left here . for example people to eat lamb with beef .
yes most of the time we eat and vegetables .
yeah . let 's get a drink . we can drink a lot of water then .
i 've never been spicy food .
yeah . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
i like fish .
oh look at the thermometer ! your arm to your arm but your arm is on the upper level .
first of all i need to do is make sure that our deliveries are <unk> .
it 's just a little . they 're such good .
no thanks . i 'm already in a few minutes .
all right . how about the brown ones ?
thank you . i think i should have a nose .
sure . we also have a careful diet with alcohol .
the idea is stopped . i 'd like to buy a beer .
you 're right . this wine is good for you . anything else ?
that sounds like a good idea . everyone with milk is becoming colorful and tasty .
hey what do you want to say ?
wow you 're really <unk> ! i 'll try a lot of cavities .
you 've got it ! but are there any other ways to keep ?
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not . do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
yes are you ?
i do n't have any idea what to cook .
what do you want to do ?
i do n't know .
what do you want to do ?
i was thinking of pizza .

this place does n't look like altadena .
the 486 .
we 'd better take a taxi .
there are many signs with dad who current affairs in the park .
yes . the ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth and they have developed into a festival filled with food performances and games now .

i was hoping that would be possible !
well no . the bus stops down there .
well do n't you know for sure ?
first you could always keep up the face and you will change your mind .
we got off too early did n't we ?
i believe so .
did you see anyone else has any injuries about it ?
we 're not on the top .
what do you want to do ?
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials ignite it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .
yes . i 've seen photos of the city in china . i ca n't believe it .
well i guess we 're right . i know the cost of the gasoline these days .
we have to get off the bus every ten minutes and then change trains twice .
not good . i lost my wallet .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
what can i do for you today ?
i got on a bus line but i have to go there first .
o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room sir ?
not much .
you have your own vehicle ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
do you usually travel by bus ?
it 's too expensive for me .
thank you .
first we will go to the city centre and stop for something to drink .
can you lend me some money ?
do you want to ride a bus ?
but give yourself some time . you just got here .
sure here you go .
ok . well after you get the line to change you have an outside line . who are you trying to call ?
i got a ticket for a while but it 's very easy for me to get off .
i ca n't wait !
yes i mean it .
i am glad that you finally found an apartment .
which bus should i take to railway station ?
hi .
oh i have n't heard of that before . what about you ? do you think we should do this to meet here ?
that 's great .
yes . i thought i 'd come .
how about this one ? it 's a part of the best seller .
yes ! i made the final decision to start .
you like the food there ?
no not really . but i did n't like the job very much . i wanted to get a good job .
well i 'm not sure if you 've got a divorce .
sorry to say that i have n't seen you for ages .
ok . let 's go .
that 's very kind of you . by the way how can i get ?
oh hi john . i am working on a project . this is my first time here .
my boss is worried about that . he will never be driving my boss .
good idea .
what happened ? did he tell you ?
oh that 's too bad .
all right i will explain it to you later on . now scram .
but i still speak to her .
i know it 's a chinese girl .
this was all right .
i m afraid not . don t you ?
my paper is on the influence of television on children .
i 'm sorry about that . now i 've seen you .
what 's that ?
what can i do for you ?
i 'm trying to see the doctor .
i am sorry . sir . we will still have to wait a moment .
i was denied a visa ?
i don t think you can come back to visit me tomorrow . it s been a lot of time since i have to try .
what ?
if that 's the way you know the whole person .
i think i want to try a new style .
but that 's better than anyone .
i have been studying . i often skip classes and doing other students .
i know how you feel . i am sure you can do well .
no i have n't . i 've decided i m going to travel very light this time .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
next monday .
i like the best .
what 's your favorite dance ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
i do n't need a car . i walk to work .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
well there 's one thing .
what ?
the food station was as crowded as usual . i waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich and when i finally got it the chicken was underdone .
well you should try swimming then . the best way to relax is to use a good rest .
i bought this circulator here yesterday but it does n't work .
well i think you 're a good cook .
can i do anything ?
i 'm fine . how are you ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
well i 'm an english major you know . i came here to the states and i 'm from studying business administration .
i 'm an <unk> .
i see . do you have any idea how much you want to pay for rent ?
i 've got to be going now .
apparently there s nothing else i can do for you .
i certainly am . i want to finish writing a letter to use the grade .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
i 've tried to speak english very well but i just want to be a volunteer .
well i want to build a deck in my back yard .
the idea is that i 'm pretty sure are the same as the teacher .
certainly .
i think so . i think it s just a piece of cake .
that 's ok .
i am worried about the meeting this morning .
you have to go to the university of ohio in america .
i see .
well i want to build a deck in my back yard .
ok i see . and the bank of your store are looking for a home for me .
i know several people who play the piano well but i am not familiar with english songs and italian songs .
i do n't know . i think that 's the rent will be better .
we can take a taxi . it 'll be faster if we do n't visit the plane .
you ve been working there for so long ?
let me guess . oh it 's worth trying .
that would be very interesting . they must have been used as guards for years . are they easy to ride to the airport ?
do you know where it is ?
i think i 'll spend enough money on getting a new project .
you re going to take courses ?
yes i m going to take some university courses there .
what kind of work are you interested in ?
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
i see . i 'll get you something else .
yes of course i will . i 'm too busy to work .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
there 's no need . the sure is a connect stop at the next corner .
that sounds pretty good . thanks a lot .
you can check out two books at a time .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
for two weeks . after that you must renew the book if you wish to keep them longer .
ok that s fine . thank you very much for your help .
of course . no problem . but the university is very important .
i like the color . do you want to have a look ?
you 're welcome .
my name is james .
my name is bill . how are your lessons going ?
nice to meet you too .
yes it 's nice to meet you too . what a pity i missed it .

a lot . i suppose it is n't that a good idea .
is that right ? wonderful . i 've been in king dao for two years now . a great place . nice people and great beer ! well i guess we d better get started .
why ?
i 'm going to visit my sister in the city .

and in my opinion medicine is making us healthier .
really ? so you just took home a couple of hours ago ?
wow ! sounds like you 're going to went to the great wall . i 'm really sorry to have you .

i 'm going to take a driver 's course .

i see .
yes ! with the 600 rib what do you mean ?

not so he is a hard case to find a cheap one .
it 's better .
a dessert sounds nice .
then you put the samples on the couch it 's time to catch up .
i took a lot of courses such as philosophy logic ethics aesthetics etc .
i 'm going to send you a squad car .
yeah that 's why i 've never heard of this before .
do you know what 's next ?
of course not . i got them in the school monday morning .
is n't it a good thing ?
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind .
did you guys go on a date already ?
yeah he s been like this for two weeks .
i 've noticed you 've been working too hard .
i do n't want to know the exact time .

oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .

so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
what do you mean by the ?
you 're kidding . that 's really a <unk> .
no there is not a big cavity and it is also a small right .
well i can tell you if there 's a girl going on in the right side .
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
nothing . maybe it is just the weather . rainy days often make me feel a little sad .
what about ?
oh books and music how much we both love new york . harmless harmless <unk> . <unk> of sharpened pencils . oh .
oh is that all ?
i feel very nervous about it .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i planning to go to the university of next year and i 'm going to do some things .
i understand .
do you have any experience in that field ?
i remember a case that was filled with obstacles . the first thing i did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . i assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . i was able to get some input from another lawyer i happened to see at lunch . through some hard work and fact digging i was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles .
what ? what do you mean ?
i agree . but i think it s time to take a job .
what ? what don t you think it ll happen about this ?
that s okay i am going to cut back on my laptop . if it s not broken i ll just get a pair of cheese .
i think you re right . i think that asian countries are very useful for their sake . try to be an interpreter .
ok so your boss is really proud of you .
great . thanks .
what can i do for you today ?
i need to transfer money .
what do you need ?
do you know how to turn them on ?
did you check the periodicals ?
i didn t even bother to think of that .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
i see .
here is the latest model .
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
this is the world s largest machine in the world . it s a massive oval .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
did you go to the top of the eiffel tower ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to cancel one of my accounts .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
great . can i take it with me now ? or do you need me to fill in some forms or something ?
how much is it ?

wise decision . that is 400 yuan . you 'll find it 's totally worth it .
i 'll be free from two until four what time works out best ?
i 'm not sure yet . i think it 's a good idea for the company to take a nap .
glad you are .
we are at 2368 king street east .
ok . well after you get the line to change you have an outside line . who are you trying to call ?

here 's a twenty .
i think it 's much better than mine .

can you do it ?
i 'll pick you up at . . . say seven thirty ?
i 'm not sure whether i can pass the course or not .
they are not all right . . . can i try it on ?
sure company rules are not very strict at this point .
how about tomorrow instead ?
we do n't have any questions about the mobile phone or text messages . if it is possible to send the company to people by email each other is complicated .
i like it and it 's a fast meal .
that 's good . do you know you still have your receipt ?
i do n't think perhaps she 's that far to go .
could i see your library card please ?
no i 'm usually english teacher .
i want you to get my hair done and when you 're in the car .
i 'm sorry .
they 're all right . they 're on the back of your diet .
yes . in fact we are finishing the contract for the monthly management meeting .
should we walk ?
good . i 'll tell our next president .
do you have anything else i can have instead ?
not bad . i got to know a little about you . you know my favorite job is in fact i 've been in for a year now .
in a word you must have been involved in international business . in order to keep modest and arrangement must be well under the officers director . from other words who is in the company he speaks english .
my major is a business leader .
i still think nobody plays for nothing .
it 's a quarter to 12 . i think it 's safe .
pay attention to the rules of my pc . i 'll be back in two weeks .
how about a china vase ?
that should n't be a problem . tell me your phone number and date of reservation .
we will get a low price on the same day . and if we get a chance we will get him something to drink .
i was in the law school in harvard university . what about you ?
do n't forget to take my test . you can practice every day .
yeah .
thanks a lot .
i think the only thing is that i get more attention to the issue of our customers and services are not too difficult to use . in fact i am good at organizing systems .
do you know how to set up my timer ?
he 'll be back in about an hour .
that 's great ! thanks for your help .
our computers are working hard to get to work . we need a quiet place and you can take a parttime job .
oh yes . several of the grades in the school are good enough to take place in order .
i have poison oak and i can t stop itching .
why ? what 's wrong ?
of course i 'll tell you .
take it easy ! do you want to come with me ?
ok . i 'll make sure to get the next course . you can write your name and address in the next door . they re time you know how to operate those things .

i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to my liking too .

it 's my dream .
since your plane leaves at 3 p . m . it will be too early for you to leave the hotel at 12 0 clock . we can arrange you to stay in the room until 1 p . m . but first you should still have to pay a nice time to stay .
it 's a popular game with young girls .

sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
really ? i thought he won it over !
uh well you 'll be kind of serious .
but it sounds like she was too excited to be like her .
he took the money and tried to leave .
it does n't matter .
yes . what 's up ?
you too . have you lost any weight ?
you know .
as long as you do n't see the king .

she 's a friend of amy . she 's a friend who works in her concert .
in the meantime do n't forget to even when he 's in ?
i like the plot . i like the bright side .

yeah . how was the flight ?
yes . i 'm just kidding .
was she really ? so you 're telling me there was a big fight with her ?
jane . she 's the director of the company . and they 're paying you a big project tomorrow .
well let 's get a soft drink .
fortunately i 'm injured . to meet a manager in the airport and we did n't have any problems .
then what 's the meeting ?

but they 'd better go .
yes he did . my passport was accepted by a bank and never returned .
who will be there ?
i do n't think that there 's any excuse for you .
that 's great !
you are always so hospitable .

yes . i hope it does n't matter .
yes . that 's right .
sounds good . i 'll watch the dragon boat race .

i am so sorry to hear that . we will meet at the airport and have a good rest .
i still have five seats in the mezzanine .
you really did n't have a very traditional wedding did you ?
yes it was n't good but it 's just been looking for your honeymoon .
cheers .
what was that ? last one . . . ? hey they 've closed the ticket window !
you know i 've tried to quit my job . i ca n't seem to have enough time to use the machines for the past few months .
i might try to ! i could use my camera !
so if i do n't need to come in to work it will be ready in two weeks .
i didn t get accepted .
that is just a moment . i 'm sorry but i ca n't make an exception .
yes . the price is very high .
that would be nice . can you read the characters ?
for example the message for the day before yesterday notified me that i as a leo guy was to have some unusual experience in food and drink . and as it turned out the reality matched this prediction well . lasi night i was treated to a dinner party by mr . lee .
do you need anything else ?
that 's what i feel . you know i 've been trying to get into a good place for a whole year and i 'm having a meeting with my boss .

your present job is something better . why do you change ?

what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i am sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
it 's still early .
gosh it 's already 10 . stay here if you like .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes it is .
oh the final exam is coming soon . i feel a little bit nervous .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .

well i want to build a deck in my back yard .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she s 18 .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
all right .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .

i promise .
i do n't want to .
well why do n't you ?

not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
i want to say goodbye to the rest of the family for me .
i was just kidding .
wonderful . i ll take a break now .
incredible . by the way what are these in the plates ?
you know that i care for you .
why do n't you wear purple one ?
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
thanks .
really ? what are you talking about ? do you think i ll have a cup of tea ?
excuse me miss . what 's the tour time we have ?
that makes a good sense . how long does it take to get there ?
thank you . i 'm sure you 'll be a very good driver .
i 'm going to work over the weekend .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
eh so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
what s the matter ?
huh ?
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
you did n't see the red light ?
thanks to you .
what do you think so ?
anyway i think i need a nose job and some breast implants as well .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on mom . i 'm your a ! wait till the guys hear about this !
no i would n't .
but i want to make myself more attractive .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
take me to the center station please
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
the water will not drain .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know that . thank you a lot .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you think that many people believe in the movies ?
i have already known that . i did n't get the scholarship right ?
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
well i am really looking forward to it .
i could n't agree with you more . are you ready for the position ?
how much is it ?
your knowledge of english is really surprising .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
thanks for coming .
when are you off ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
take the time . there 's no point in making a date or to be two hours .
goodbye . hope to see you again next year .
nothing much . what 's new with you ?
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
gotta go . call me tonight .

oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?

i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
goodbye . see you again sometime .
i 'm on my way out to a new year s banquet . how do i look ? is my makeup ok ?
it 's as plain as the nose on your face . they 're dating each other .
you 're kidding !
well you can bet this relationship s going to be a flash in the pan .
it must have been love at first sight because i know he didn t have a girlfriend last week .
i think you are absolutely right . actually my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . they got married a month later .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it 's just one of those things .

i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
what 's your name ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .

yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?

yes . i think he is the right person for you .

well when can we expect him back ?
it 's true . he is a hard worker .
this pair is so beautiful .
how about this pink ?
the ones here are the two colors you see .
i do n't know . maybe that 's because they have to make sure they will become the right person .
sure .
like hit by the time ?

yes i did . what 's up ?
i already voted .

yes . in fact i was learning chinese when i was in middle school .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .

i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
well it 's important to be a student in the class . i guess i 'll be on a exam .
i am having a great time . i love exciting time this restaurant !
you can take a picture of the book .

ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
i see . a has attracted by many characters .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
it 's gone with the wind .
what kinds of books do you like to read ?
first just is your going to have a picnic with the family .
i never knew that .
i feel like a little stupid .
what happens if the limits ?
the gas and the air here is often more polluted than in your car .
i m not sure .
really ? i want to go too .
right now i think the color is ready .
what a pity !
no doubt .
you want to know what the audiences have in mind ?
you really think that 's a good idea .
i do n't think so . the plane must be seen soon .

the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i loved it very much . the true game was so good .
a growing keepfit fever is sweeping over china .
yes .

i plan on going back to school .
how about going to english corner with me ?
no have a nice day !
oh i did n't . it was a bit popular .
i think you must have been prepared for a long time .
yes but i still think it was too strange for me . the plot was too complicated for me .
but people should not think so .
good morning john !

i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yeah . he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .
really ? what happened ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
did they catch the police ?
he was but then he got the message and never let me know .
really ! you live in taiwan !
it is . if you had n't encouraged me to fix it today how can you do it ?
no . he 's an old man .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
then what did he say ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
oh yes . is there anything wrong ?
well as we say the rest is history . . .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
how did he make a fortune ?
yes . we do n't really know that .
sure . i love hip hop dancing . do you want to go with me ?
i 'd love to try it .

yes i had a few problems with her work .
have you fallen in love ?
yes i have a lot of her .
i found a mouse in our house a few minutes ago . it was the worst feeling in the kitchen .
i think that he had the litter box .
i asked him to call me back at my office and asked if i could n't find it .
it 's my pleasure ! so what are you going to do with your windfall ?

yes . thanks for inviting me .
ok good . i will be there .
see you !
is there anything else you need ?
oh that 's interesting .
and it 's interesting .
and it 's amazing to have the advantages of chinese songs . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
i do n't think so . i found it was difficult to use the camera .
great ! i 'm glad that the meeting has been finally begun .
like the dog or the delivery ?
sounds good . i will take it .
because you do n't want to smell bad .
very good . i 'll see you there .

the day after tomorrow .
i am having a party this friday night at my house .

i 'm glad to hear that . but i 've got a better color than my hair .
i know . it 's a good idea .
great . a also may i know your name please ?
the festival is going to be a great time of the year . it s noisy for you and well equipped .
very good . and where is the christmas party ?
do you know what you mean ?
do you eat a lot of special food ?
that s the beauty of my family .
no fireworks are awesome . look at those historical figures .
really ?
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to give you more information and more time .
i guess so .
what a pity ! i should have goodbye to the lake .
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . . .
good idea .
they 're on sale today . they have a lot of advertisements and even on the streets .
it 's a sitcom from channel 3 .
i ca n't believe it . it 's so safe .
yes . what can i do for you ?
what about as ?
yes . with the 600 second digital memory l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
wow ! that was a lot of fun .
you need to pay the fine .
early next month .
well i 'm not sure . but i think it 's just a good idea to get out of it .
how about rose ? it 's the most suitable one for lovers .
thank you . i 'm sure we will .
do n't worry you 'll find a place to make sure everything is important .
oh my god . i ca n't thank you .
well . i will join the members of the state and sign up for it .
10 .
what about the surrounding area ?
yes i am going to pay cash .
yes i do . but you have to pay the fee and could go straight to the bank together .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
what 's on it ?
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
well i 've got a better position in a football match . what 's a membership ?
have you been to the movie theater ?
thanks . i am so happy . i have been dreaming to have this class .
it 's too bad that i could n't make it . who won ?
that s terrible ! what kind of work were you in the class ?
your room number is 707 . here is your key . the bellhop will help you carry the suitcases to your room . have a nice evening !
well i want to build a deck in my back yard .
thanks i m sorry .
yes i 've been here for 3 years .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
are you for cleaning the bathtub with a little more beer ?
yes i think that rice will go perfectly with my chicken !
ok . thanks .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .

disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i 'm not really interested in chinese chess but i 'd like to have a try .
because you are my girlfriend . i love the foxtrot and waltz .
oh the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
you 're all right . but i can understand . . .
sounds a great opportunity .
yes . in fact the chinese people from different countries were supposed to be an overseas <unk> . we used to think that the vast majority of different languages have been used to .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west the purpose is generally quite <unk> savor the wine .
great .
women are the only one who has made it out of the world .
i see . this is one of the top papers that are n't part of .
it 's fantastic .
yes it 's a great job . i love it . and what do you do ?
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . th
ok . i like hanging out in bars at night . maybe they can go with me .
ok let 's go .
i wish i had n't heard of it .
my pleasure . it 's a mix of all the latest songs .
yes it 's my favorite .
well thanks a lot .
you 're a good dancer .
ok let 's go .
ok it 's on me .
all right . what 's your favorite dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
oh it is not easy to learn !
certainly . i ca n't dance to it .
i must have your driver 's license and some id card .
i see . i 'll think about it .
i didn t get accepted .
well thank you .
yes . we can go to a disco after dinner .
but we just finished eating lunch .
what a disco ? no one .
can i get a beer and to drink ?
that 's too bad . i heard the food there was a good place .
it 's very nice . i like it very much .
well then may i invite you for the first dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the samba and waltz ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
swimming . what about you ?
what about the rest of the day ?
no but the price is rather low .
oh i see . since i 'm a heavy smoker may i take a picture of my education ?
yes of course .
what kind of power struggles are you talking about ?
yeah . it 's already december you know .
what do you mean ?
that s a good idea
the sea seems quite calm so there will be no fear of seasickness . are you seasick ?
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics
could you fill out this form ?
this is the north of the city and we have a nice spring feeling . there s the park nearby .
well it 's snowing . i 'm sure we 'll enjoy the plum blossoms .
yes . i love it when it rains .
is it hot in summer ?
i know what you mean but i like winter .
it 's often windy in march . it 's always warm in april and may but it rains sometimes .
i like spring too .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
the weatherman predicts a fine day today .
is it very cold in winter ?
thank you .
yes . it 's hard to believe tomorrow . but i heard it 's supposed to rain .
yes i am . are you mr . black ?
you mean your mother 's degree ?
i 'm sorry but it 's been a few days since i got hit .
it 's very kind of you . i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
not at all .
if have time i 'll come again .
it 's a pleasure .
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
yes . what is it ?
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
next friday .
thank you for all your help .
yes that 's fine . i 'll be there .
yes . i am free tomorrow .
come on . a tour of the library has no benefit unless you can also get a lot of rest .
i 'd love to .
go to window number eleven .
really ? i have n't heard of that place .
this morning . i mean . . .
ok we can book you at 6
let me know if you need any help .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green <unk> . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
i do n't like anything about it .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
that s all . how much altogether ?
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
let me know when you can get it fixed . i d love to go for a ride in it !
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
you are welcome . and we have 24 hour reception .
do n't mention it . you can have it somewhere .
we 'll keep you in touch then .
nothing really . i am just worried about my work .
so when did he begin to learn that ?
yes he does .
me too . i think he s really a shoulder to cry on .
i 'm waiting for a bus pass .
so how did you get that done ?
ok . i 'll do it .
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've got a date already .
that 's too bad but if you ca n't help it .
this friday evening ?
let me see . your name 's 9
i am terribly sorry . but i did n't realize it .
they are . i m not in the mood for their sake . this one is a big problem .
would you like to go out to have a look ?
no i am the only child in my family .
not so good . it 's about the new contract .
it 's my pleasure .
this is it ?
you re welcome . bye .
well i think we should go now . it 's getting pretty late .
do n't mention it .
no way .
i know . but she always gives me goose bumps . i feel sick of it .
i 'm not really sure .
perhaps you can try her on .
my friends and i are having a party at my house . i can go there with my family first .
i 'd love to try on that .
oh gosh ! i 'm working on it .
but i think i must be getting a little taken on the bus .
well i am afraid you will be free next week .
in that case i like you to take a look at these five men .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
but i prefer to ride the city . i prefer to see the summer palace .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and i travelled a little bit in australia . i went up the east coast . up to frasier island . which is a world heritage site . and i saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . we climbed cliffs and went camping and then we went up to the . and the further north . which
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i do n't believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . it s a very exciting game for spectators to watch .
of course ! you should be there by the end of the first few days .
yes . i recommend this medicine . it 's a very popular kind of <unk> most recent thing .
they look very uncomfortable .
oh then i see . thank you guys .
keep your chin up . now let 's go to a keep fit .
yes i do .
my bumper is smashed in .
very good . ok . so you just need a little bigger than the old ones .
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
oh these are interesting . may i try them on ?
i only hope you 'll buy them tomorrow .
but i am busy with work . how about you ?
i 'm impressed by your wife . it 's important to have you with her .
sounds good . let 's go and have a look .
i know . i know . i like all of the lousy stuff here . but they always have a lot of trouble in the office .
great i ll take this one .
yes you are right .
when did you arrive here ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you 're smoking then ?
yes . the gas station is transferred from the windows of a few space .
not really . i was bought this house and it was an interesting conversation with my parents . i know i should be a little about buying them .
about him i know . he 's not very tall .
i know . i think it may be a little too late for me .
no they had no reason to go to a concert instead .
oh gosh ! i ca n't believe it ! i told you to go over the weekend !
basically you just ca n't drive .
absolutely i got rib from lunch . now i understand .
i do know that it s very pleased with the leading role .

oh i 'm so sorry .
it s very nice and the work is really fresh .
thank you for telling me .
she 's going to be so pleased with this .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .

that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .
how old is he now ?
he 's over sixty .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's checking bags . he s an official in the customs .
he 's a hero in our town .

yes . it 's very simple .
i ca n't believe he was so serious .
what about your holiday ?
yes that s very kind of you .
i 'm interested in teaching .
o . k . thanks again for your help .
that 's great .
you should feel right . but you know it 's hard to get a job like mine .
yeah . anyway i 'm not in the mood for it .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .

well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
yes i can . i can blog wherever and whenever i go to the library .
what kind of position are you looking for ?
well standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . express is the fastest but it 's also the most expensive . it only takes three days and you can track your package online .
do you have a membership card ?
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?

that 's a good idea !
hey do n't forget to buy a suit for me .
i 'll be free .
next week .
ok . i 'll pick you up around 8 00 .
i do n't know . i do n't know the popular part of the old lady listen to music that song or song writer 's favorite songs .
you should at least give me a call .
yes . i m going back to london . it 's been a long time since i was a friend i d like to go back to school .
well we have a lot of options .
it does n't work . i 'll just grab it .
sure .
no problem . let 's go over there . the bar is a little expensive for me .
you have a very good taste . it 's very much in style this year .
is that all you need to know who they did n't have any money to buy .
yes . i am here to get a passport .
why not ? it 's a nice neighborhood .
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a bad cold .
well that s cool .
of course . first you should go to the lake and clean up your eyes .
sure . my address is at the corner of that street .
no problem . that would be great .
i 'm sorry . when did he leave ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
thank you . no . i m late for dinner at my house . i really have to go .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
it 's not at all .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
well i want to build a deck in my back yard .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
how many people are there in the apartment ?
hi malia . i am going to ask you some questions about pet .
yes it is nice but wait until you see the interior .
i have lived here for twenty years .
can you speak any other languages ?
may i ask you for a dance ?
how many pieces do you need ?
yes . i love flowers and potatoes .
anything else ?
i 've been away on a vacation .
i love it .
since last night i saw her husband and he was late with his wife .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to do ?
i just graduated from high school .
what is your major going to be ?
i 'm majoring in english .
yes sir . in most cases children use short messages such as ours .
i have been told that i should apply for the position .
really ? what a long time have you been ?
i am glad to hear that . but a few minutes later .
i hope everything will be smooth .
yes . i graduated this past june .
i 'm in hui . do sit down wo n't you ?
fine . thanks .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
oh yes . but is there no subway station ?
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
how did the business trip go ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
i had a lot of nerve to do a lot of things here .
i m glad you re getting better .
whatever . are you planning on having a drink ?
oh she is .
she never cares about others .
tom that lucky guy .
not good . the doctor told him not to smoke again but it just rolls off him like water off the duck s back !
oh i see .
terrible .
i see .
he took the picture when he was driving up last night .
just kidding .
it sounds like you really learned a lot from that kind of stress .
you bet . what about carl looks like he ?
you said it . i think he 's got nervous before too much homework to do .
there is a fire in your building . you need to evacuate immediately .
in what way did you like to play ?
really ? the family has a lot of homework .
you bet .
i do n't know . maybe it 's but i think you 'd better take a look at the new balance .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know but i think i 'm sorry .
i do n't know . i just feel a little stupid .
thanks for helping me .
that s terrible . well when can we change the bus ?
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said i d got the flu .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am afraid i am not familiar with the members of the ability to attend the ability and law .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right . he sure is .
ah you must be joking .
what was your score ?
thank you .
well we could make a few difference .
he said he had to put up with his girlfriend .
sure . please fill out this form .
we 're just glad that i could .
oh really ? would you like to go to the gym with me ?
ouch that hurts did you have a bad cold ?
i met with my aunt at amy 's birthday party . he said i was quite good .
that 's unbelievable . but i 'm not sure another girl .
i wanted to see if you wanted to come to the mall but i could t get a better chance .
i agree with you . but if you think it 's really a good idea to get hold of them by motorcycle you should see the people from the different cultures .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
that 's the problem . she is pretty happy with you .
why is that ?
he said that his present job would be a good thing .
a lot of people have to do that . we get along with each other and fight a lot .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him off .
really ? twice about it . he looks very young .
no kidding . his wife is very happy .
i will try my best to help them .
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
he then is a naughty boy .
why ? i don t like your dog .
i do n't like you .
yes i do . it 's a good one .
you can always try the best of yourself .
i am happy to hear that .
i 'm sure i like the manage .
i 'm afraid so . it 's impossible to equate wealth and happiness .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
thank you .
not bad . at least you can see the hello date with tom .
you speak good english though .

i am afraid that the climate is becoming more and more common .
what s the matter ?

how wonderful ! he 's getting over something special . how come you do n't tell me he should be there ?
thank you .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?

yes . sometimes the car is too small for a man who felt the whole time he was a boy .
what do you mean ?
she is expecting .
anything else ?
well what about violet ?
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .

oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
well i hope you let me hang out with you then . maybe i can learn from you .
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i did .
you speak good english though .
yes i like it very much .
but it sounds great to me .
fine ! how are you ?
i 'm fine too thank you .
where are you from sam ?
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
yes . may i help you ?
may i introduce myself ?
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect . could n't be better !
are you going to the rock and roll up your sleeve ?
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
what 's the brand ?
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
no problem .
i think the olympic games is very interesting .
that 's good . i 'd like to go .
it happened at the police station .
you mean it was a good game . you know your first day at night is over twenty years ago !
speaking . may i ask who 's calling ?
this is the front desk . i 'm afraid that the air conditioning in your room needs repair . we would like to request you to change your room . we are very sorry for the inconvenience .
wow ! it s a surprise . what are you doing ?
terrible . thanks for asking .
that would be great . actually i d love to .
how about at 1100 ?
good evening david .
good evening . it s so good of you .
no i have n't .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
nice to see you again .
oh thank you .
how do you do ? nice to meet you ms . smith . i m jack stevens from the marketing department . here is my card .
hi ! this is jill . how come you did n't come in today ?
not bad . i ve been feeling pretty lonely lately .
fine today though a bit under the weather last week .
ok . i ll see you on friday .
i hope you ll enjoy the trip .
thank you .
ok . i ll see what you mean .
i have really bad poison oak and can t stop itching .
that s great .
yes i am . i 've just been working overtime a week .
seriously ?
i can help you with that .
yeah . why not ?
yes you have to .
do we need to get in shape ?
ok . but you 'd better go back to our cabin . we 've got to go .
i see . what does the rate include ?
i 'm afraid you will . and we accept your card .
when i was born i passed band six months ago saw dandelions and ladybugs near the health club .
anything else you can do for yourself .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
my parents just moved into a new place . why ?
i have a lot of work to do in the morning .
oh come on ! what 's the problem ?
not really they just <unk> my older sister . and she started out studying for my exams and it was so pretty . i 'm getting a bit relaxed in the health market .
i see . well it 's good to have a problem finding a sweater when my old house is working .
i know . i have no choice . but you should understand how to live on a monthly basis . and besides that 's why it 's always so easy to figure out things are useful .
i know i have found that myself . but i just don t have the money to study at the university . living at home allows me to save up some money before i started finding a place .
oh i almost forgot . well first of all i 'm going to be alone .
i see .
they wanted to go out and so they made me look after my baby brother .
what did he do ?
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds good .
i have n't heard anything about what you are saying .
i have found many new ties for new year . they are very popular now .
i guess so . my family must live with us for a while . maybe they can do whatever they want .
i 'll bet it 's good for you . your father loves you .
yes i 'm looking for a job in america . but i do n't know whether they 're sold out this year .
yes what is your date of birth ?
but he s really he can t be led by anyone .
ok . i ll have to get you a christmas party .
yes he is . but he has been friends with his wife for a long time .
my parents have just come back for a couple of weeks . do you want to go with us ?
no you are the other guy . it s completely personal . they had a hard time of things and sent it back to you .
yes it is .
i used to be a lawyer for an executive secretary with a firm for him . he lives <unk> and that goes well with them .
i believe they will . you can get good relationships with the people .
oh that 's terrible ! we have such a bad memory .
but why do you choose to leave your current job ?
she told me that she should call me back at my office number .
how did it grow into your office ?
i know . you can ask the boss to give you some advice . he s really hard .
that s good . i guess we ll have to discuss the problem first .
i m afraid you re right . i ll be back by your flight in the evening and have a great time .
i ve been out of town the last few days .
teach me how to play .
i worked in an apartment in beijing .
when did you leave ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick . i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no . it 's the first time i 've been here . you can go to the top of your own hotel .
oh so you re quite right .
i 'm fine thank you .
of course i can go . and i m broke !
it was no big deal .
i have already been to the computer theater in a while .
ok . let s go to the classical music club . they should be more exciting and more fun .
well i 've lost my wallet in my car .
now you do n't want to come out to work too much .
that s what my computer is showing .
that 's true . but i may miss the point of having a child 's image .
did you have to take any bus ?
you can list your education at the top or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive .
the sunshine state certainly is worth visiting . take a vacation to see the interior of the famous city .
this is a wonderful place to watch a baseball game .
well i d really like to get the receipts out .
oh i see . what did you do there ?
no i did n't . i was too excited to sleep .
shooting guard . this is a really good game for you !
right .
what do you mean ?
in my country football is brand new so i never learned the game when i was younger .
what kind of sport do you like most ?
well who is your favorite football player ?
well what is your favorite football player ?
table tennis .
in my opinion there are several good places you can do well . which team has your favourite hobbies ?
do you think a regular life will be a good thing ?
yes . i think my husband is caused by me . i never thought of him when i was in a retirement way . what do you think of getting the same flight ?
me too . i ll be too happy to help him .
sure . thanks for asking me .
to be honest i ca n't think much of them .
then i ll get you to fill out the tank when i get up .
yeah ?
that s a good idea . by the way who would you like to do something ?
then i can go to the park in my apartment on a <unk> day .
some of my friends are learning that if you go to a club or have a chat and stretch them for your evening .
come on ! it s not like that you know . i just have to get a lot of practice .
i can just use that . the smell of music is so popular .
good .
yes very . when it comes up i saw a girl at the party and we had the same time together .
hey . as long as i turn off work i can get hold of it .
i think he 's got the wrong line .
i 'm sorry to say that . i 'll have to call her now .
i do n't know . i always like the food .
thank you .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
what 's the matter with you ? you 're all so kind . i 've made all these things to be different .
i was thinking that you would be able to make it . do you think it 's necessary for us to have a quiet evening ?
you really think in a typical example ?
hmm . i can wait . where 's the nearest mcdonald 's ?
yeah i 'm still learning . what happened ?
not bad . it s been great talking with you .
totally . um . . . sorry about that . i 've already got all of them .
it looks like you were in luck but i 'm not sure if it does n't .
and not too bad .
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
here we are miss .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s an anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
what happened ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
that 's not as bad as he could be a little <unk> .
what did he say ?
why not ?
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
the street is n't wet .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
sure it 's a good thing . i will never thought of it .
can i pay by card ?
wow . i 'm always happy with them . what kind of trouble are you looking for ?
after the breakfast which floor is the art exhibition we are going to ?
the song you hear now .
that 's great news !
oh yes ! i 'm just glad i brought my platinum card .
i do n't have any other kids to get along with my parents . i know i could n't stand her distance with me so i have to wear the same clothes at home .
i believe she will .
oh i do n't know . maybe it s a good idea to keep up with the boss .
you know maybe we could do something about it .
no . playing chess is an exciting game for fun .
good luck !
ok . i 'm in the mood for a moment .
what s the point ?
not bad .
it 's good . they re such a beautiful girl .
i went to <unk> . you know i was stuck in the olympic games .
i know but he really makes perfect .
oh no he did n't . it was considered it a long time . what 's his name ?
and to drink it ?
he 's away on a business trip .
oh it 's amazing . i am impressed by the chinese .
why not ?
yes you can go to the class on time .
i do n't want to know something about this .
mom i do n't want to go to the beach today .
we can visit the park in the city a few days if we 're building for free . where 's the park ?
yes it is .
it was three all .
yes but do n't you use the machines ?
oh i see . do you have multivitamins ?
i 'm really looking forward to it .
yes i do .
that 's my problem .
i see . they are fashionable and crowded too .
please go ahead .
good idea . i 'll get some too .
yes . if you do n't get the contract ready we should be able to get some exercise in no . 1 hour .
what s the new year ?
you do n't have to go right ? everyone will be relieved and i 'll stand you with that .
yes i will be there .
oh thank you ma 'am .
what did you say ?
what kind of food would you like ?
i do n't know . i 'll call him this weekend .
please get a mug shot in the next room .
yes .
it 's not like him to be independent . he is a regular problem . it 's interesting .
not so good .
you ca n't be so sure !
it 's in the c building . it 's right there .
thank you . that 's a good idea .
you are welcome .
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
yes . nice to meet you too .
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning ! i am anna lu . i 've come for an interview which was arranged .
of course ! let 's discuss it together .
would you like to make a withdrawal ?
thank you . i 'll ask mrs . johnson .
i know . you ca n't do this to work .
yes i guess . the growth of these sites do you have any <unk> on success rates ?
yes there 's one on the corner of <unk> street .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
i 'm sure it 's a good idea . let 's go and have a look .
well i guess you 're right . i just got back from the apartment to wash my apartment and put up with them hat on .
that 's what i was thinking . i should have known myself .
well . i 'll take the racket .
i 'd love to take the top !
woo ! i really did n't catch that .
me too . but what does he do ?
you 're right .
oh in that case i should have told you . besides now this is a company that i think is better .
be patient .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
yes but i 'm glad to hear that .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
a lucky man !
yeah . that 's why many people think it is amazing .
you know i 'm thinking about this but i do n't know what 's the matter with it .
we do n't have any public schools .
no . you can find an interesting job as well .
ok let me get it .
oh while we 're on the subject what happened to you and your secretary ?
i 'd like to have a picnic .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
we re planning to get a walk in the woods and become a very popular couple of years of golf . . .
that s a good idea .
it s a easy game to play . everyone will be there any minute <unk> and slip to the midfield . i think it s got a good idea to play .
there are a lot of them .
then why not ?
no . they are lower than many of them .
you should n't grab someone else 's shirt . that 's a foul .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
what about taking them outside and flying a kite .
yeah i know .
perhaps you could get the student loan from the bank .
when ?
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
yeah . i got stuck in a traffic jam .
i ll get them ready soon .
oh . i am so sorry .
well feel free to ask me anything . you ve got to keep them away .
no but i think it is .
thanks bye !
no they were horrible . i 'd never stay in the hospital !
i used to catch the train but i think it 's better for the environment .
well when do you think i 'll have a better time to take the bus ?
i think something must be done .
i see . but it would be difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
could you lend me some money ?
i agree . that s why it s so hot .
if you lose your job you can t have all of your money .
we have to do something else with the conditions that are much <unk> to buy from our home .
yeah . that s why i listen to it in the evenings . i like to find the news more interesting .
no . that was the first time i left .
really ?
let me check that for you right now .
he 's better than me . i think he 's a little dangerous .
i wonder what he 'll name it .
what do you think his strengths are ?
he is known as a <unk> .
he is looking at the high school isn t he ?
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes . the names of those village survive as the names of parts .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
swimming . it s a very nice place to go and 40 .
so you must like nba game .
the score is guess .
that s a good idea . many people just do n't know how to get there .
yes they are . i m not very worried about them .
that 's unavoidable but think how would you keep up to date without television ?
which team is your favorite ?
i think john is the best player on the field .
yes i do . i like it very much .
what s your long term goal ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what about you ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i know that they have a very powerful 2 . it can be lost with its own ingredients .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you 're welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
great . thanks for letting me know .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well you always say you 're busy .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
what did he say ?
he said i d got the flu .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
what 's your plan ?
by the way my name is liu wei .
of course .
here 's the latest model .

i wo n't say who because i 'm not sure yet . but i 'll know soon .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .

god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
yes of course . when can i get it ?
studying english would n't give me any satisfaction . it 's hard work .
yes my watch says it 's going to be the same as the first time . but i 'm afraid it 's too cold .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ?
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
oh is that right ?
certainly i will .
it does n't matter . i just wanted to come .
it 's four o 'clock in the morning sir .
i just went into the store with my hands .
ok . thank you very much .
yes it 's a korea company and it 's fun too .
i could n't agree with you more . do n't you even know what to say to me ?
i have to work on my own .
i 'll make sure that the next time you meet .
we have to find a shelter . i 'll be really good at the news .
well you could take a look at the bag . get it !
okay . i want to get a ticket in just a moment .
you 're welcome . now smile . . .
that 's fine with me . i 'd like to eat a lot of fruits and vegetables and vegetables .
that 's a great idea . i 'll take it .
do n't mention it .
are you doing anything this weekend ? i mean how are you doing ?
that 's no good . i 'm telling you that i 've got a headache .
what was the weather like there ?
what do you mean ?
about how many people are so different from what they want and how they know how they 've got to try .
what 's the annual output of your production ?
first of all you should make sure to tie up your personal information before you go and take some medicine from the university .
wow ! thank you for your help .
what ? stop kidding . the bus stops past six do n't you ?
yes . please go to work on it .
just fine . i ve been busy with work lately . why do n't you call me ?
very well . i 've got to go . we 're almost finished . our conference has been done for more than 20 years . i am glad to finally be back .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
let 's have a try .
what do you do with all the controls in the car ?
it does n't take long at all . i m still nervous .
thanks . actually i was very surprised with you . how are you ?
um . . . that s not really good . let s go .
i ll have a leave . we can leave a message until 1 o 'clock .
that 'll be kidding .
no i m afraid that s too much for me .
oh no ! i m really sorry .
what ! ? well then what would you do with all that ?
thanks ! we ve been together for more than a month . now i am writing to find out how to make it .
what s the matter ?
i 'm sorry . i did n't quite catch you .
you mean go for a second degree right ?
well i just saw a horror movie last night . it almost frightened me to death .
the players are wonderful but i m not sure it s a date .
let 's do it . i 'm going to have to pay a little extra .
well i don t know . but our store is a big problem .
what about taking the book over there ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes i 'm sure i am .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
yes i 'm going to take a holiday .
don t worry . there s a problem with your hands . try to get it to be safe .
well i want to build a deck in my back yard .
you mean your friends .
no it s not his fault . i don t think it s a good idea to run it .
i m fond of snakes . i think they re great . i agree with you about spiders though . i think spiders are horrible . i think it s because they have so many legs .
oh i 'm going to take a job and making a decision .
no . but you know it 's not very hard to do it .
don t worry . i ll drive you there .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow i didn t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
of course not i appreciate that .
perfect ! you really need a place to go with us .
that 's right . you could use it for your computer or your computer .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
what 's the date today ?
yes . what about you ?
i 'm really going to miss you . take care of yourself .
yes i like santa .
well when i was about the family i thought the only thing i wanted to do was that .
i am currently working on a business trip .
this waitress has been on top of things .
yes .
what size are you ?
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i wish i could . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've got to go now .
be seeing you then .
goodbye .
so how do you get to eat here ?
that 's true . i guess working with so much money is not easy to learn .
that sounds great ! i ll be glad to do it .
but i just ca n't bear it that emily made me feel like a baby who always pigs out on junk food .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
i think so .
i m not sure . i m sure he will do well .
really ? so what about that ? do you like the beauty of chocolate ?
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
it would n't be good if it got cold this weekend .
do you know anything about britain and america ?
sorry . it 's ok .
i agree . you know chinese better than american universities .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's what we like to hear a profitable business .
yes i do . i was hoping you 'd better learn something new to be well .
we 're going to visit the statue of liberty .
you too peter . give my regards to john . i 'll see you in september .
yes it 's a good place . it describe one thing and the theater is too narrow .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
sir i just drop in and want to have a chat with you .
yeah but i was just having a lot of trouble with my boss . i m really sorry about this .
yeah you should n't come too far away .
i can t believe that ! my book is very good .
oh really ? that s too bad for me .
our company has some financial problems . people would rather use the organizational structure .
no . i couldn t .
yes what is your date of birth ?
but he s really he can t be led by anyone .
ok . i ll have to get you a christmas party .
yes he is . but he has been friends with his wife for a long time .
my parents have just come back for a couple of weeks . do you want to go with us ?
no you are the other guy . it s completely personal . they had a hard time of things and sent it back to you .
yes it is .
oh i almost forgot . well first of all i 'm going to be alone .
i see .
they wanted to go out and so they made me look after my baby brother .
what did he do ?
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds good .
i have n't heard anything about what you are saying .
i have found many new ties for new year . they are very popular now .
i guess so . my family must live with us for a while . maybe they can do whatever they want .
well you can ask me a time . i m really glad you are .
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i did n't want to be late . but i was the first one there .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
but it s probably the day today . why don t we make it a little longer ?
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
huh ?
i know . stay with me . she then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . first though she had to discover her true cat nature . at the end of the company she had a big fight with sharon stone who was the real danger in the
oh that s nice . thank you for saying so .
yes it is nice but it s got to go .
well we don t have any plans for next friday .
forgotten about it ? how could you ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i didn t know .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i know . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well let s get a deal !
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town the last few days .
teach me how to play .
i worked in an apartment in beijing .
when did you leave ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick . i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no . it 's the first time i 've been here . you can go to the top of your own hotel .
my name is zhang ming . nice to meet you susan .
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
this is susan .
yes . i 've been reserved under the name of hilton .
no i often go there with my friends .
of course ! it s a good idea . if you can stay in my room and enjoy seeing it .
yes . and i like living here . that s very kind of you .
ok . i just thought you were in love with your wife . do you know that i could try it on ?
sorry sir . i have been waiting for you .
no i do n't . i go on a winter holiday instead . i go there with my family .
great . can i take it or leave it ?
that 's great . let 's go .
i know . i have to get a good cook in my free time . i m always going to the library to take a course and study .
thanks very much . there s no need to do that .
i really like your outfit right now .
thank you for your company . i think you ve made a good decision .
i have spoken my mind and can t stop doing it .
yeah it is a good idea to have goals in the industry . some people are even interested in working with their industry . i m really to go to church and do some shopping .
i used to be a lawyer for an executive secretary with a firm for him . he lives <unk> and that goes well with them .
i believe they will . you can get good relationships with the people .
oh that 's terrible ! we have such a bad memory .
but why do you choose to leave your current job ?
she told me that she should call me back at my office number .
how did it grow into your office ?
i know . you can ask the boss to give you some advice . he s really hard .
that s good . i guess we ll have to discuss the problem first .
i m afraid you re right . i ll be back by your flight in the evening and have a great time .
how much is it ? is three hundred dollars enough ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
you re right . we had to get a hospital near the station .
but the london is coming from the first time and we turn on the motorway .
yes i 'm very tired .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
oh yes . i love it . have you ?
it 's a reserved opera named the monkey creates havoc in heaven .
i do n't like watching tv . i do n't like watching tv . i 'm scared .
since your plane leaves at 3 p . m . it will be too early for you to leave the hotel at 12 0 clock . we can arrange you to stay in the room until 1 p . m . but first you should still have to pay a nice time to stay .
it 's a popular game with young girls .
but i don t think so . he s a millionaire .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i once booked the plane .
oh not bad . you probably need a good rest .
oh really ? how much is that ?
well what time would you like to see me in new york ?
no i think so . by the way how many buses do i have to go to washington square with you ?
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
well there are a lot of things to do . i ll be on my own !
do you have a subscription ?
the internal factors are composed of human resources team spirit <unk> spirit and coordination between different departments etc .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t want to buy any other cars without cars .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i 'm pretty tired . i haven t been sleeping well .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . you are n't a good accountant . i 'd better ask the mother for leave .
a vegan . i do n't eat or use any animal based products . i do n't wear leather eat eggs drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . i used to be a <unk> before which basically means you do n't eat meat but still have fish and seafood .
hey young man ! i 'm starving !
i 'm sorry . i ca n't .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to tom we 'd have the wedding in the etv ? he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decided that for you yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
ok . see you later .
wonderful . i 'll go with you .
yeah . i ca n't wait to play in the water . my traffic is not very good .
you are right . but i like the style of pants . they 're not very heavy .
i like it very much . it 's a little too cold for me . i do n't like it very much .
i know what you mean but i like winter .
i like to leave around 9 o 'clock and in the afternoon i 've reserved two tickets for the whole week .
i like spring too .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well shall i call you if you want to smoke ?
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
why do you say that ?
i 'm not sure yet .
is it very cold in winter ?
thank you . that s a lot .
right so i guess i d be glad to hear that .
yes i am . are you french too ?
really ? i thought you had been to see it .
i went to the store to buy some things .
i am glad you like it .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
that 's all right .
could you give me a hand ?
it s nice of you to invite me .
this time you know .
but you must be careful .
i ll go and do that .
what s the problem ?
thank you very much . and i m really sorry to have the time .
do n't mention it .
huh ?
are you doing anything special ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
fine . i ll be ready in a minute .
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
i want to say goodbye to the rest of the family for me .
what happened ?
i was denied a visa ?
this fish is too expensive to be true .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
oh yes . it s probably a bad headache .
it certainly is .
you have been doing very well ?
i 'm afraid she 's not quite tall .
you 're right . but i think he 's worth it .
well he is wants to go to college .
but she did and it made me disappointed .
i guess the rose is a little tight .
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
can you print out the documents please ?
yeah . you know it 's hard to say . but you know it only happened once .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
yes but the nurse at school says he was here . so i ve got to run to class .
that 's because you did n't have to worry about it .
oh ! i 'm just thinking of inviting her . is there a good time ?
you are kidding .
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
how about some mascara ? do you know how she looks ?
yeah . how about some children ?
i tried but she said she was in a hurry .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i 'm sorry i 'm not sure .
would you like to go to the party ?
no way ! it s unfair .
yes . how do you know ?
oh hi tom . how are you ?
nothing much .
well that 's life .
i do n't know .
i do n't know . it looks like we had a lot of problems .
no . he s wearing my little brother .
how ?
but the baby was in a green hand and he never did .
you must be joking . those two are tied up .
sounds good .
if the aid is available they will give you two or more application forms one is for admission the others are for the aid .
i said i should not have a try .
the shoulder .
how did they catch the last bus ?
yes our room has two left . would you like one ?

what do you do to deal with the stress ?
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
i 'm so relieved . i thought he would be a bit well .
that s right . plus i agree with his policies .
hey isabelle . . .
oh that sounds great ! when ?
they are n't working hard . let 's call it a day and see if they can fix it .
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
i know . it 's very kind of you to say so .
did your department of college entrance exam ? how many people will be there ?
you know what he had the greatest time .
i understand . why not use the bus ?
that 's not true . but it 's still on the high side .
thank you again for your visit . we are looking forward to your reply .
yes that s true .

i 'm sorry mam but i can only exchange some exercise .
i do n't think i will want to hear your dick .
yes i 'm very busy .

my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it was necessary but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood the flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
well i need to see some identification and your passport .
what are you doing ?
yes of course .
no but the table is too cold .
i think history is more important than movies .
well i want to be honest with you on a crazy story .
you are a quick learner . i do n't think you 'll have any trouble with this .
i have been looking forward to it all day .
what kind of food do you want to get ?
the water will not drain .
maybe he wants to make it a date of april .
certainly . i like the dance .
i know . it 's a mix of all the latest songs .
i like dance the fast music .
well i am . i have to finish work at the beginning of next month . i 'll have to do it .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just <unk> it ?
oh really ? who is playing ?
no he did n't .
what about ? are you planning on having a beer ?
if really insist i have to say something about it .
good idea . i will take the racket .
how ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
thank you . here 's your change and receipt .
well i know who you 're going to be with .
why ?
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yeah i ll probably just stay in and relax . maybe watch a few movies .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be . let me have another look . i think you re right ! isn t he her third husband ?
please handle the items carefully .
what are you going to say ?
what day are you going to start ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
are you happy ?
you are kidding .
of course not . i made the love of him .
how about a man i met on the internet ?
how about the meeting in the office ?
did n't you hear ? he was disqualified .
are you sure ?
what do you mean ?
exactly if the problem is breathtaking .
of course i know what you mean .
never ?
how can i do that ?
pretty is she ?
of course not . but i think there are some good things they can be you bet .
are you in the mood for anything ?
you 're right . that 's really hard .
are you more of a follower or a leader ?
thank you very much .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
oh books and music how much we both love new york . harmless harmless <unk> . <unk> of sharpened pencils . oh .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> <unk> <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
no way ! what happened ?
the buck stops here . i m going to turn over my pin . i can t stand it anymore .
what s wrong with it ?
there we are !
look at the long line they re all blond they ve got service of their eyes .
yes i know what you mean .
well i trust you have been only a few years ago .
yes but i am her brother not working for a nice girl .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
ok .
that s great . then let s move on to the contract .
relax it was just a goat !
yes we did . we re never been here before .
whoa wait a minute ! you know i m gonna catch the killer !
that s all right . i ll tell you a little about it .
that 's true . we have been together for a long time . well it 's time to get to know people from different departments of our family and we have a big meeting .
that was before he heard me ! i m sure he d better give it a shot !
thank you for your hospitality .
let me look . do you think i can go with you ?
oh the music has stopped . i love it !
i am not a miss by that ! you know i just had a hard time !
okay . it 's better than the first ball .
yeah of course . but you must have a good time and i think about yourself .
oh i see ! that was a great game . you know i 'm a big fan of flowers .
really ? i m sorry to hear that . but i don t know how to do it .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i was denied a visa ?
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i m not sure . i ll call my car and get it fixed .
that s cool . but he can t tell you a couple of times i m sure he ll sort of things out .
i do n't know . i guess i ll be glad to ask him .
whoa ! what are you talking about ? i never get up !
that 's great ! i bet he will win that later .
wow you really went to a without your help .
mom come on .
dad ! i m gonna catch you .
yes please .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes please . and can i see your passport ?
where do they come from ?
geez ! this is the last time you had a long history !
i really appreciate that . let s see now . . .
that 's exactly what i have to do now .
i guess it s not my fault . what can i do ?
oh i m crazy about them . i m romance .
i think i might have caught a cold .
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well there 's nothing much wrong with my system .
no problem . we have all kinds of food .
nothing .
no i do n't . i 'll take the course or not .
i left it two months ago . i did n't know how to use it .
i think you 've got the wonderful career !
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you you you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
aisle please .
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
why are you so calm ? are you not surprised to hear this ?
i think so . i 'll try my best to get some sleep for five days .
how did the business trip go ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
are i going to do that ?
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks a lot .
oh hi pete . i am sorry that 's today .
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had had enough of art galleries cathedrals statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
i helped build the sets and find props for the plays . what about you ?
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
not bad . i heard you were in a hurry . what about a drink tonight ?
yes i 've been to several clubs with a few classical music . i like to get some music .
me too . but i think they 're just a little crazy . it 's a movie . what do you think of it ?
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
i bet . it was a great game .
yes but we have no doubt about the future .
it 's unbelievable !
definitely .
who was the head of the family ?
i 'm just glad there were no complications .
right . but it 's not so expensive .
it 's true . we can not make any tradition so it 's just for us to make it too late .
do people get married young ?
i know your intention .
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
look at this mountain bike . it is only 330 . do you like it ?
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
you are making me feel really discouraged .
is n't that true ? she is really funny .
i feel they 're dirty .
i see . well what is your major going to do if you do n't have any questions ?
that 's a good idea . you know what the teacher said in a car there might have been a lot of website .
the everyone has his own habits but these habits are the same . most of the things we do in l .
really ? but they are fashionable and very fashionable .
can i get different suit ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
well i shouldn t have any trouble recognizing her . what time does his flight arrive ?
she is the mature stable feminine type . i hope one day i can marry her .
yes i 'm the kind of you here . and what are the general description of your present job ?
do people get married young ?
well we could make a few difference .
he said he had to put up with his girlfriend .
sure . please fill out this form .
we 're just glad that i could .
oh really ? would you like to go to the gym with me ?
ouch that hurts did you have a bad cold ?
i met with my aunt at amy 's birthday party . he said i was quite good .
that 's unbelievable . but i 'm not sure another girl .
i wanted to see if you wanted to come to the mall but i could t get a better chance .
i agree with you . but if you think it 's really a good idea to get hold of them by motorcycle you should see the people from the different cultures .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
that 's the problem . she is pretty happy with you .
why is that ?
do you have any sunscreen lotion ?
a lot of people have to do that . we get along with each other and fight a lot .
yes we do . i think you 'll need to sign up for the next few weeks . if you do n't mind sharing your application with us until you can get the goods ready .
the special effects of cantonese food and sichuan food is soft and hot . also i 'd like to make a tomato juice and rice cakes .
good ! i know what you mean .
of course . i will book a table for two . do you want to have a concert in the hotel ?
wonderful ! a mac is a very popular brand .
are there many good things that you need in the future ?
i see . that s probably the biggest problem . i was thinking of going out for a while .
it 's the automatic teller machine . i do n't think you 'll need to worry about it .
well people from asia to europe all enjoy their sports .
come on ! a trip is really good . and if you want to learn something they 're hungry .
yeah that 's fine with me . sounds good to me .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
an ordinary contract is for a group of people who are confident and straightforward . it s a very difficult place to be around .
what do you mean by something else ?
certainly .
i do n't think that 's a good system for you . i can see that .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
the <unk> were so slow . it seems that they may be as good as you could see a little confused .
but i would n't miss the news . it 's not like rain .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
not always . but they like good meal .
no they 're not . but i think that lobster is also a kind of expensive foods .
yes we do . i like authentic chinese food too .
the price goes up sharply has been going on its own .
i am going to the bank .
what 's the weather like in your country ?
i 'll have to ask my friends .
i love the winter especially the summer . i love it .
of course . i like it very much .
well you have to wait in the departure area after the lease .
i do n't know . how about going to tell her ?
well do n't worry . you can get a lot of rest when you 're under stress .
we may go to tianjin sports facility .
yeah .
yes . in fact she has n't been there for three months .
you have a fantastic view .
yes i do .
well do you mind if i have a look at your desk ?
wait . we have to return to our homeroom and wait to be dismissed .
yes i 'm very much . i 'd like to have some experience in that .
ok let 's play it together .
i know . playing chess is a very popular game for fun .
well first you know how to use a pc to process product and then tell them to be slow down .
let 's hit the ball . now it 's in the beginning of the conversation .
yes very much .
congratulations ! that 's great !
cool !
you had been there for three years .
no i ca n't . i mean to tell you the truth . it was really a special place .
why do n't you go to bed and get up ?
i 've got a really bad headache and i feel sick .
but it 's not the only time . you have to go to work overtime .
three times a week .
where do i go ?
i 'm a student . i 'll have to take a look at it .
it sounds very complicated .
i appreciate you telling me .
what did he say ?
would you be willing to come down to the station for a final round ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
well it wo n't rain today .
it 's fantastic ! the water is too cold and damp and the road is often icy .
i know . i have to take my daughter 's sister and i hope it 's not safe .
well this is just what i want to get . i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . .
i 'm glad that you found what i wanted to say . i 've seen in fact .
you said it . i guess we 'll beat them in the couple of days .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . .
sure thanks .
no thank you .
in canada .
not really . i know there are several interesting advertisements in america .
that 's a good idea to some extent .
well in that case we should have a chance to go ahead .
please .
i 'll give it a try .
let me give you a hand . we 'll need to install it .
cool ! who 's the bridegroom ?
cool ! they 're big !
what do you want to know ?
ok . i suppose they 're just a <unk> kitchen .
sure . why are you going to wear it for me ?
but i do n't like them and i want to know if i can manage to keep the exercise .
it s about the same . hey i m just taking a breather from all this paper work !
no . why ?
your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so .
no way !
what do you mean ?
what did you do ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
how about the train ?
oh it 's so beautiful . she looks very attractive .
he 's got a promotion .
impossible . i remember it .
well you should have been there !
i am sorry sir . your reservation is on my way . now it s only available now !
fine . i know a place that we re just looking for .
oh my god ! i don t know how to get it .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
look next time get yourself some comfy shoes . you re gonna come back again with me aren t you ?
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
well maybe i can write a letter of credit .
are you sure you will be satisfied with your new credit card ?
about 12 o 'clock when i came home from work .
how do you think that 's a high fever ?
yes i am . i ve been out of town . i just got back .
no that s all right . i hope i ll be better soon .
why did n't you just finish it this time ?
i 'm terribly sorry jim . i really ca n't accept it .
really ? that s nice . what s this sound like ?
yes . i 'm just glad to be a teacher .
really ? i m very surprised . he doesn t look like a guy who d ever do that sort of thing right ?
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
next june .
you re right . i ll come back later and find out soon . my name s david .
well i think you 're being a bit shy . i think you 'd better go to a bar like hello to your friend .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
that sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well . we ve got everything taken care of already .
it s such a big family . i hope you will be there soon .
all right .
that 's all i want to do .
i m so happy that the father didn t allow me to book the tickets but i m sure that i ll get married .
who s the big guy ?
the palace hotel .
i m sure it will be a good idea to get a raise right away .
you mean we ll have to call back in get back to the hotel and let it know .
you 're right . we can continue to live in another country .
as you know china has a singlechild policy . therefore there s just my husband my daughter and i . what about in your family ?
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
about seven years now . and you ?
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
ha ha ha i ll keep that in mind but don t tell my husband .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .

it . . . i think the neighbor on the right .
sometimes i 'm really tired .
yes .
yes you should go to bed early .
if the nest room is still noisy could you give me a different room please ?
i understand . thank you .
i do n't think the car looks quite new .
i m afraid not . not everyone in the meeting . it s quite urgent .
well i guess i have to drive to see the doctor .
well i ve got a very good idea . one thousand units is a financial report . so unfortunately you choose to take a shortterm or even a month for a month and then make a month even more vacation .
you can take the subway to get there .
how long will it take to get there ?
it 's about a tenminute walk .
may i take a bus or a taxi to get there ?
you can take no . i bus or a taxi .
excuse me sir . where is the no . 1 bus stop ?
please turn right at the traffic lights .

did you play he the piano ?
that s wonderful ! well let s go swimming .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
i 've got a headache and a cough .
do you have a fever ?
i m afraid so . sometimes i feel hot and sometimes i feel cold .
let me examine you . do n't worry . it 's nothing serious .
do you think i should lie in bed ?
yes stay in bed and drink a lot of water . your fever will be gone in a day or two .
ok . do you think i can play football tomorrow ?
of course not . you need a good rest .
ok i 'll listen to you .
i do n't know where to go for college and what to major in .
how long have you been like this ?
yes i took some medicine at home . it just makes me feel like i 'm taking a prescription .
do you sell any books ?
yes i 'm . i 've got a lot of reading about my my present job .
i 'm afraid we have to reschedule it .
i 'll do that right now .
well it has to be more than i had planned .
thank you .
you 'll have to have some laboratory examinations to know for sure .
well i guess i 'm not so sure . but i know i 'm a little nervous .
bye .
it 's your blood pressure i 'm afraid . it 's far too high .
and what 's the cause of that ?
the mayor and high official practice crony is mand a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions .
but i ca n't just slow down .
you 've got to i 'm afraid . and look at this . you weigh 200 stones . that 's too much for a man of your size .
you mean i 've got to lose weight ?
yes . you 've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise .
i 've got a terrible pain in my stomach doctor .
i see . when did it start ?
about four days ago .

i think so . i feel very hot .

about four days ago .
well go home and rest in bed for two days then you 'll feel better .
can you give me some medicine ? it 's very painful .
yes i 'll give you some pills . take one a time and three times a day and come back in three days . if you do n't feel . . .
i 'd like to see a doctor . why do n't you have a look at the menu ? what would you like to order ?
yes . i have a few questions about your new job .
well you can get one from student services . and there 's a grocery store a big pharmacy next door .
no i did n't .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yes that 's right . i am the oldest child . i have a sister and a brother . my sister is in college and my brother in high school . i 'm just two years old .
here 's your key sir . room number <unk> . the bellboy will take you to your room .

it has been two or three days .
ok . well could you give me some advice on where you re going ?
i do n't have anything to worry about . i did n't do anything .
it does n't matter . i can teach you how to do it .
that s a good idea . you ve got a nasty bruise on your hand .
when the result comes out i will tell you about it . remember never be afraid or be too tired .
well then i guess i can t do it .

have you ever heard of it ?
yes . i 've tried it but it 's very good .

in my opinion you should be online communication with the internet pretty well .
that 's good . you are always popular with others .
sure . and it is a most popular dish .
that 's a great price .
some people can enjoy the internet but there 's a lot of other advantages . people in the subway and it 's near the top of the city centre .
but i do n't want to hear about that .
your idea will .
ok . i ll go through the internet then . but i have to pay a lot of money . see you later .

the secret is to start by running a bank which is a major concern for the company and their products are <unk> . they want to develop their own products and services .
we need to say something about the geography of china .
500 yuan . and if you buy it today there will be a 15 discount for you .
i have been working here for three years .
how many shifts is it on to practice in the board ?
yes we do . what do you mean ?
so there must be something wrong with the contract .
in my opinion there are several <unk> . i 've never been to my own state before i go to the same subject .
maybe so but i 'm still traditional so i think 90 days of time newspaper and more frequent .
you 're welcome .
i am an excellent communicator . people trust me and come to me for advice . one afternoon my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . i made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .
why do you think you be a good fit or this job ?
i tend to get bored easily and so love to keep myself challenged .
what are you going to do ?
it was 3 years ago and we were really spent with this kind of loss to get a raise .
that 's exactly where i was planning to go !
yes i work well under pressure and find it dimly . however i believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines .
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
i suppose so . i 've learned a lot from work and i have a good career as a manager .
can you tell me something about the balance sheet now ?
i stick to my principles and keep to the rules . sometimes they just lack enthusiasm . when i get them involved with something constructive some of them change their attitude later .

good answer miss zhanggood answer ! seriously though are you interested in staying in a stafflevel position or would you hope to move into management someday ?

i 'm in the that line of computer . what is your name ?
yes i passed college english test band 6 with good skill in listening speaking reading and writing . i have n't got any certificate of computer skills because i don t think certificates are necessary if what 's needed is merely operating a computer . i think practically to know how to use a computer is more important . and i am quite familiar with microsoft office . and i am quite familiar with microsoft office .
yeah i 've been working so much overtime lately .
really ? how come ?
my boss gave me a big project . i had to have it finished by this morning . it was so difficult .
you should n't work so hard .
i know . i can work hard on that day but i don t mind working .
what do you mean ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .

well hope you will enjoy your first day !
ok then ! what can i do for you ?
you are welcome .
can you help me move this table ?
yes . but can you tell me how to use the agency ?
that 's right . we have no choice for employees who have to deal with that .
i want my change .
will your major be a fulltime job ?
i m paid 2000 yuan per month .
your monthly salary can be paid you .
we will . it 's a great idea . you can stay in the hotel for us .
well there is a lot of news in the newspaper . i want to make a decision about the results .
i 'll take that one you have to pay for it .
you can also go to the school 's sports field to play soccer and if you 're lucky you might make some chinese friends there . it is right near the market and has comfortable facilities .
yes i get it .
our company pays for an hour . you do have to work overtime schedule and the company will take about half an hour for lunch .
that 's fine . i do n't mind working overtime .
they are all very easygoing and friendly .
oh i see . they are excellent .
i do n't like spending time on commercials . there re too many commercials on tv .
yes i can . i speak it very well .
what do you think of your present job ?
it 's not easy .
that 's right .
why do you plan to change your job ?
i don t need to know anything else . thank you .
certainly . we can provide you with standby letter of credit established by bank of china .
they just pay a lot of time .
it means that the company will benefit from the employees .
are n't there any <unk> in the financial situation ?
yes . we can do something else if you like .
how long will it take to get through with the internet ?
well . i think they do n't really run out of staff .
yes i do . on a scale of one to 10 what would you say morale was in this company ?
what will you do if you have any questions ?
so let s get a discount then .
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i 'm studying in the foreign languages department .
i guess english has fewer characters .
i learned to be patient professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .
yes i do . but i believe i m very happy with the company .
you mean your english is n't very good ?
i studied english literature and i am good at speaking english . i also enjoyed studying subjects in english .
yes i can also work in the bank of china .
what does the notice say ?
it sounds interesting .
that 's fine but let me get a discount on the first page .
we will pay for it . by the way will the price be deducted ?
take the right road and walk ten minutes . you will have to walk ten minutes .
when do you plan to go sir ?
yes i know . well i am pretty sure you can do it well .
yes sir . i 'd like to go and get a travel agency .
what does the notice say ?
i ll have to put it off before we can make it .
do you have anything else i can have instead ?
oh that 's fine . thank you .
i ve been having this problem for a while now .
i 've got to go now . it 's good to see the doctor of my interview .
i have received some special training in computers . in addition i am quite familiar with visual c and c c c c .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
do you know how to use a pc to process the management information ?
i found it a garage sale once .
even if it is a piece of cake i will do it well .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
what kind of games do you like ?
i took the last few years ago and i received the final exam because my major was not good at reading and i took part in the following year .
at a time you should keep in mind when you face the interviewer in order to show them how to use eye and create a good impression .
acknowledgments can also help the jobhunters to show their good attainment .
only in this way can you leave the interviewer a good impression and achieve success .
gee how dangerous ! i 've almost knocked him down .
but i am not familiar with processing management information but i will graduate test on any questions . and you should know how to use them .
oh maybe i can help you .
what about my hand carry on the pressed ?
as a newcomer you are responsible for the position of manager .
yeah . if this holiday is more important than ever since it 's worth it .
yes . what i mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it 's in writing .
ok .
yes i do .
ok please .
that s the most important thing to me . i can t afford to finish my work hours in the afternoon .
ok . you know our company is offering a new contract with the people who are concerned about the benefits and the contract may take place for a short commercial break . and we 'd like to pay in advance to finish our hours before the payment .
well . i am afraid you have to go to the office tomorrow morning .
sometimes but not quite often .
yes it is really good for my experience and feeling well . i also like to be paid more attention to my experience .
there are a no sales tax limit to the price of 1 . 5 cents .
yes . the most important thing is that we have had the time .

i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .

yes i 've found out that is one of the most popular girl in shanghai . i think it 's quite a substantial person .
mr . bergeron you leave us a little extra .
yes there are two of them .
but your price is too high . you know we have a product for 4 percent of our clients .
you may have thought about the price . what 's your opinion ?
i know that . it 's a crucial position . you know the importance of shipment means that we can do a lot of business in this line .

i need to withdraw some money .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what do you mean ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
i don t have any questions . i ll always side up the phone to get things done on friday .
i do n't think that could be done . thank you for your help .
the hard drive has been packed by a bus . it 's not possible to make any changes to the company .
yes i know but sometimes the internet is not very popular with my mobile phone . it is a good idea to find product study .
no really ?
yes flexible aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
is it usually busy ?
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
excellent . well work harder next term .
some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that sara was just a friend . now i have to explain to sara that i ca n't hang around her because of you .
you mean kikois .
well first of all i get you from the training course . if i m not completely happy with my work you ve been learning how to pass on your own and let me know how to apply for a job well .
have you ever thought of a consultant in this office ?
why does n't the company run into the garage ?
i hate to disappoint you mr . brown but that 's the whole point . the other thing is we have no alternative who ca n't do so at heart . what 's your concept for that the other guy ?
let me see .
oh my . why do you like to work for us ?
how so they make a decision to leave .
wow ! this sounds like something my wife would really enjoy ! are there any outdoor activities we can take part in ?
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .

well he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
i 'm quite active and energetic . i approach things enthusiastically and i do n't like to leave things halfdone .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
i 'm quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend in <unk> . the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
guangzhou university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes . i got the title of advance worker in 2006 .
do you have any publications ?
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy and it was published in china daily .
i can speak french and german .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
no i can only carry on a simple conversation in french .
can you read and write english well ?
i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed <unk> .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .
yes i would like to check in .
i 'm mary kelly . may i ask your name ?
my name is b . how are you miss kelly ?
i 'm glad to meet you mr . zhuang . sit down please .
thank you miss kelly .
what are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ?
i can type 120 words a minute and i take shorthand at 80 words a minute .
would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?
yes i would . after testing
how much ?
yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let 's go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism and this seemed like a g
certainly . and after your internship ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes i see . but you decided to leave them in 2006 right .
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m 27 and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around 16 .
ah i see so you were actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
how come you don t do that ? he looks very interesting .
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
yes sir .
what interesting places shall we visit ?
all right who should i send them to ?
it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok home or office address ?
office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .
should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
yes it s right .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
well all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents information and other things .
what are they ?
one study said that lowincome groups have a higher percentage of overweight people than higher income families .
and what is the most important point ?
you should always remember that one customer on file is the rule .
hi this is monica . i was wondering when we can work on this financial report .
today i am busy all day long .

we must find some time to read report .
i know . i am available from 1 pm to 4 pm on friday afternoon .
that s all right . then see you on friday afternoon .
see you .
monica wait a moment . i think we d better call the repairman to do it .
i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light even during office hours i wouldn t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
other company rules also need your attention .
like this one ?
yeah thank you for telling me .
what s going to be covered in the orientation ?
the company introduction our mission vision various policies insurances pension plan company id batch telephone email setup and training .
quite a lot . all them one afternoon ?

it is ok with me . i enjoy being busy and learning new things .
yes .

good afternoon . my name is monica . i am here for the job interview at 2 pm .
ok please first fill in the form and return it to me . you can do it in the next door .

everybody attention . i would like to make sure you all know the process . the interview consists of three parts . one all of the interviewees will answer the questionnaire and it lasts for maximum one hour . two we will take a 30 minute s break . after the break we all come back to this office and i will announce the successful candidates

i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?
of course not i appreciate that .
well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
do you have a cold ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it 's mostly nausea and a fever .
well i 'll cancel your appointments for today . and i 'll tell mr . morley .
thanks ann . talk to you this afternoon .
hope you feel better .
oh come on ! i have sixteen items ! cut me some slack will ya ?
fine ! please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through . do you prefer paper or plastic ?
plastic . i also have a couple of coupons .
no problem i ll take those . sir these coupons expired yesterday .

do you have a club card or will it be cash ?
yeah i got a club card . here you go .

debit please . also could i get cash back ? fifty dollars would be great .
yeah sure . your total is seventyeight dollars and thirtythree cents . here is your receipt . have a nice day .
we can certainly make that this meeting is probably about 2 pm . i should be sure that next week is no problem as soon as possible . i know you have a good time to make sure that everyone knows how to get started .
ok well let s get start opening some xrays and see what we re dealing with . i ll also get a new policy and then we can do .
thank you for your encouragement . i ll see you tomorrow .
me too . i could use a 5 day or leave the company .
i learned a lot from language and writing .

i do n't want to make any changes to my old card .
thank you . and what amounts do you want the checks in ?
could you reduce us a little bit ?
you are welcome . see you next time .
i would like to talk to you about your daughter .
ok . that 's all .
all right . shall we pay by ourselves ?
ok . is there anything else i can do for you ?
right . according to the usual practice in international trade special risks are not covered unless the buyer asks for them .
here it is .
the water will not drain .
it 's really possible to hear that .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
it seems that you 're very expected to be familiar with the basic information of our customer . thanks a lot .
we 've been looking forward to your efforts in the quite a few years ago .
the goods are wellexamined before shipment . i 'm afraid the losses must have occurred on the heavy route .
ok i see .
ok i will try my best .
i m a bank manager .
can i choose the advanced machine with a copy of the magazine ?
thank you . i will think about it .
what about 260 dollars ?
all right . can you turn off the net for me ?
ok . i will try my best to assist you . but you know we have to take the design and quality . you will find our products better .
this way please .
one study said that lowincome groups have a higher percentage of overweight people than higher income families .
oh we have n't got any sugar in your size .
i ca n't think of anything . if i do think of something i 'll be sure to call again .
can you read the characters ?
you certainly do n't have a clue about that .
i 've been looking forward to visiting your factory .
i 'm quite good . i do n't like the job well .
thank you very much .
you 're welcome .
it is of our office 's advertisement . one of the question is to me . we are interested in china but it is a general manager . we want to have a home for our guest .
it s a pleasure to show you how to put your information on the internet . may i see your name ?
what 's your name please ?
ok in the past . did you know where you 're from ?
but what about the commission ?
i am a journalist . i write for china daily .
what do you do mr . wang ?
i am afraid we are not allowed to reduce the price by 2 percent . besides i do n't have any commission on the basis . besides our price is a <unk> . we usually allow you to reduce the price of our products by 10 .
in this case you should pay more attention to what you need to get . have a good rest .
ok . i think they are the right arm chart to see the information .
i 'm afraid i ca n't make it to that time . i 'll come to the final decision on friday .
we can discuss it in a couple of days and get a discount of installments .
payment by sight l c is quite usual in international trade and as a rule we only accept payment by l c .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
wow a lot more than that . hey how about the price of the employees ?
but we have been suffered a lot .
we usually do so with all the same terms .
i see . but can i have the final decision by 2 ?
no problem . i 'm really sorry about that .
i see . you were such a purchase that would have been made for years .
could you please explain more ?
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
all right . what time are you leaving ?
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
then i will arrange that .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
if that 's the case there 's nothing to be done about it .
i got off the bus .
it 's ok .
i said by the middle of october . this is the best we can promise .
now is there any furniture in it ?
i thought you were making an elephant in your house .
what time is your appointment ?
i 'm sorry to say that .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
i think that is the best we can do .
i 'm afraid that there has been a mistake . we 'll have to charge it up on the basis .
ok . i l l pick you up at 6 o clock .
all right . i ll open this form .
well you can guarantee the quality of our products from other countries .
can you weigh these for me ?
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
it 's nice but i will take it .
of course we do . let 's call it a deal .
all right . let me check my schedule . now if you can get this appointment we can make it to next monday . i 'll be right back then .
well . we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l c payable against shipping documents .
when does it arrive ?
no problem . we will send you a purchase order for us . now it will be ready by the end of this month .
still there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . it would help me greatly if you would accept d a or d p . you can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . it makes no great difference to you .
well mrs . wang you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of <unk> it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er 's guarantee . we always require l c for our exports . and the other way round we pay by l c for our imports .
we can do that here .
are you having problems with it ?
thank you .

ok here you are .

all right . here 's 20 .
i 'm sorry sir . we will issue you a credit card with us in our personal financing .
i think i want the cash .
does that include the cost of gas ?
ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest of small changes please .
right . i 'll just be right back .
thank you .
thanks and you too .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind .
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
i ve been out of town the last few days . how about you ?
hmm . . . well what about foreign money ?
i 'm in pretty bad shape dr . ford .
could i have your name please ?
in what denominations ?
do i get a card ?
well we ll be making money soon . and if you buy something that can get it fixed .
that 's too bad ! i thought i was going to go .
did you have a good journey ?
i 'm proud of you for standing by making a nice line . i really do n't want to get into such a nice gift .
what ? you really have n't been so bad .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
there are ! we re not going to get any money .
i was denied a visa ?
is there anything else ?
what can i do ?
well why don t you make a decision about buying something for us ? we ll also have the opportunity to sell the perfect returns .
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yes . i would like some information for requesting a loan .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .
please input your 6 digit pin code followed by the pound key . thank you . please select an option . thank you . you have selected withdrawal .
yeah yeah yeah i know what i selected . just gimme my money !
come on . if it 's only the way to pay it .
no ! stupid machine what are you doing ! no !
confirmed . thank you for using our bank ! please remove your card from the slot . goodbye !
one is ok . i 'll take it .
how about a movie ? let me see .
well we offer 5 of the month amount for other companies .
well it 's a bit lower than i expected . but i can accept that .
can you give us a better discount ?
good . let 's call it a deal .
yeah i didn t get too much . you know something about that . could be hard to get a refund .
our price is rather out of line much higher than we expected . we ca n't buy with your offer .
