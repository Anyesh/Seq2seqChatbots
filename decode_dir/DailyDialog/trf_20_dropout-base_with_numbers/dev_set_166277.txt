thank you .
i would like to speak to you an appetizer . .
thank you very much .
please get it at the entrance .
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
the operation starts at about eight and we ate an hour ago .
please .
i want to get a ticket for this evening .
hi .
certainly sir . what size were you looking for ?

first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . i 'll take a look .
i know but the apartment will be returned to you at the moment .
ok .
no you can t . it s only 15 yuan per month .
what s the problem ?
yes i 'm afraid there is .
i m sorry . david is out to lunch right now .

probably not . doing that will probably take another three hours which i ca n't afford to choose any more .
how many nights a week is it ?
it s going to be 25 .
why do n't you send it by mail payment order ?
ok . this one is already ten . you can get the student pass at 5 .
the operation starts at about eight and we ate an hour ago .

i understand . but i want to know the size of the products .
keep working hard and then you will get another chance of promotion someday .
thank you so much . i 'll just buy a dozen of them .

i believe you have a look at them . they are open from the box and they can look for your store .
i would like to buy two exquisite watches for me and my girlfriend .

i believe it s going to ms . wilson s office .
well i suppose i should have it .
sounds awful . would you mind moving with me straight ?
it sounds good . ok on this one .
yes .
are you ready to transfer tomorrow ?
what 's wrong with it ?
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
that 's wonderful .
i 'll give you five more minutes then i 'm going on without you !
yes . but i bought it a couple of times .

if you 're any further information please do n't hesitate to ask me .
your boss gave me a good deal . i really do n't want to move my car .
but we still need to go back to the office .
i got it . maybe i could just get the car through it .
that is easy .
you 'll find it by the oatmeal and breakfast bars .

thank you .
i suppose so .

i 'm afraid she 's out .

how about some chinese food ?
yes a medium coke .
he is wearing a heavy raining suit .

you forgot ? you . . .
i 'll do my best .
about twelve hours . i have no idea how many hours of the day is .
can you go to see the doctor ?
no problem . i 'll see you tomorrow afternoon .
i appreciate your understanding .
well how can i put this ? france is a terrible team .
that same morning .

i promise i 'll do it .
of course . go straight ahead till you come to the traffic lights turn left at the first corner .
i see . do you know the person i am looking for ?
it 's only a few minutes walk .
how far is it ?
you 're welcome .
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
that d be great but could i have a cup of tea first ?
sure i ll just go put the kettle on . why don t you have a seat on the sofa and i ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .
i see . well i can help with the chores while i m here . you two could probably use my help .
that s very nice of you to offer . here s your tea . be careful it s still quite hot .
it 's just around the corner . turn left at the second light and then go straight for two blocks .
is the library open on the right or on the left ?
yes .
how long ago ?
no . it 's only a <unk> walk . you ca n't miss it .
thank you very much .
you 're welcome .

yes of course . let 's go straight down this road and turn left at the second corner .
oh well . i 'll have to live with it . what else can i do ?
yes it is .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that might be going on over three weeks for that .
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . ok i 'll take it .
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing .
that s even better than the real thing .
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than 100 you get a 50 voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
sure . the fitting room is right over there .
yes i m looking for a pair of trousers .
this is kevin .
no . i 'm not a religious person .
could you be more specific ?
would you like to go now or later ?

absolutely . that s why we need to hire a person . we can get a lot of information on the internet .
really ? i have heard of that before .
that 's something that you really need to work on .
well it 's kind of strange that we have a lot of gifts here .
of course ! i m a good singer !
they just said that the presents they are on sale for .
i want to try on this pair .
the round shape pair ?
what sports do you like best ?
well you have fun .
i agree how much ?
you just said that the presents you wanted to get ?

so how about an aperitif ?
it sounds good . i 'd like to start with a compare .
stirred or shaken ?
stirred will be fine .
here you are .
thank you .
sure . all of our mixed drinks are excellent . you can also try a delicious nonalcoholic cocktail .
can you recommend one ?
try a singer . it has lime juice and grenadine over ice .
it sounds interesting . i 'll take one .
here we go .
it tastes great .
enjoy yourself .
yeah .
i think that it 's a bit difficult to handle .
what a lot of choices are you talking about ?
it 's a kind of rice ball that is made in malaysia . what about you ?
i do n't know . i want a chocolate one ?
how do they make it ?
are you kidding ?
they do n't like anything else .
i prefer the western tea .
i 'm not going to put a little weight into the fat .
are you sure about the food that you 're having ?
please give me a piece of pie first .
i never thought about it that way .
just a moment sir . you can pay quite a deposit of 200 and you can get the rolls of the original rate of the original rate .
blah . . . what 's that ?
no problem .
what do you mean by that ?
you 're welcome .
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
do you know where you 're going to get it ?
how much is it ?
the other day i 'd like to try some new food on the menu .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
um this steak i asked for to be medium rare .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
so she is n't causing you any problems ?
is she chubby ?
what did you do ?
have you ever been listening to any of your cv ?
one moment . do you want to withdraw some cash while you 're at it ?
well i have got your name and phone number .
what do you think about it ?
tell me what you 'd like to do .
are you scared of anything ?
would you mind waiting a moment ? i will check the supplies out .
what are you going to do ?
may i know what you do ?
how much do you want to spend ?
would you like anything else ?
i don t have any cash on me .
oh i see . you mean we can t do it .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
you 're right . we 'll be late for dinner .
goodbye randy . take care .
really ? why ?
about 200 .
that 's very kind of you . i want to make a guaranteed reservation for my wife .
yeah i know . why do n't we go ?
yes . that s right .
thank you . i know what the result of your performance is .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
oh and i 'm going to take all the dishes in the dining room .
there 's quite a long list actually ! you can use if for business trip expenses medical expenses any internal payments .
that sounds like a good idea . it will make your mother look for you .
would you like to have a look at the menu ?
that 's good to hear . i 'll bet she is .
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's about a tenminute walk .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
all right .
hello this is smith from 1308 can you add something to my room ?
is it on the usual floor ?
the machine says your card was declined .
yeah it 's really unforgettable . thank you for making me happy all these years .
it 's much better than i wanted to be . but i have to stay in bed and talk to you later .
yes . i am sure this pair of earrings are all bills .

you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
are you looking to help you ?
are you interested in today 's special ?
yes please .
how much money do you want to transfer ?

it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
we are in a really good mood today .
mangoes ? what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .

why are you applying for a visa ?

hi . it s tony calling from the dentist s office . is lily there ?

thank you . and what is your son's name ?
yes i 'm . i 've just come from the states yesterday .
i m sorry . david is out to lunch right now .
all right . i 'll see you tomorrow .
see you .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we re right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello paul !
wow you 're going to be a great wedding !
it was almost an hour ago .
i 'm fine thanks .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
well that 's great ! it 's almost the same as keeping you at home .
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
ok i will . but if you do n't mind you 'll be fired .
thank you very much .
do n't you hit it off ?
i have been working here for three years .
i think we should take a few weeks to get there .
i get to know about it but it 's interesting . he always talked with me .
but what if she is right ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it 's mostly nausea and a fever .
maybe he was n't a good singer but i think he must be directed a president of the famous singer in the olympics .
what happened ?
thank you .
but i m not sure how to get there . i know how to use it . i can only take it .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
no you do n't ! just make a promise !
what are you doing when i do ?
yeah ! i think that s all right . don t be so nice ! are you going or catch up ?
what 's the fire control ?
ok ! i ve got a few cousins on the face and my face . .
uh let 's see . i 'm just gonna get it finished . we 'll see it soon .
some of my friends play cards on the internet .
i know but they are really bad . i m not gonna quit my job .
i m looking for a sweater .
what computer are you looking for ?
i would prefer a dozen . i also need a few single ones .
what s wrong with that ?
no problem . the magazine has a history for more than a decade .
do you have a list of all the latest edition ?
thank you .
so how much do you see in the city ?
you too ! a sun blanket and the bed is really nice . i 'll come down for a while .
i m sorry . there s no idea about that . what else did you buy ?
wait a second please . . . you can get free refills with your coke .
i can do that .
and it 's a good company to look at your air conditioners . the model is good and the model is very much more beautiful in the city centre . i can hardly stand it in the city center .
come here . say cheese .
well it looks like you have a lot of gifts to get into the house .
that s right .
thanks for telling me .
no problem !
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
there 's quite a long list actually ! you can use if for business trip expenses medical expenses any internal payments .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll speak to bob he 'll be able to help us .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes .
no way ! i m gonna catch up my breath !
can you put something in this report ?
this song is beautiful but it has a great sense of humor . it will make you happy .
great news !
it would be a little more expensive sir . but there are many advantages than the second page . first it s in a perfect world . it s actually more expensive than the public transport .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
what size do you wear ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's no hot water after 10 at night . sometimes i like to have a hot shower before bed . especially in the winter . it feels good .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s a great balcony with an incredible view of the park .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
mm maybe . i could get a big carpet and i ll get some new furniture .
i have n't thought of that .
yes it has two bedrooms . that 's convenient .
it s very kind of you . i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
the ad says 325 plus deposit .
that s way too much .
well you re not going to be able to make it a lot cheaper .
what do you mean ?
that s no good .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you please reconsider ?
in my opinion you re a horrible driver .
i m not sure if i can .
yes . i like cooking very much . i got this hobby when i was 12 years sold .
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
really ? i buy namebrand items that are whenever i was a child . it was so popular .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
all right . may i have your name please ?
i 'll be glad to have a look .
the color i use now is natural beige . how much do you want it for ?
you ca n't go down much more recently .
it s a pity that i can t afford it .
oh it s just the same as usual . i ve been thinking of all these days .
oh yes . they look nice in that drawer .
they 're fine . can i have a picture of the latest ones ? i 'm not sure .
what else do you want ?
well the bigger one is ok .
they re really running you like a heavy smoker .
oh ! do you charge any extra change for the power plant ?
hold on please .
i was wondering if there was any thing i could ask you to go with me .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i am looking for a onebedroom apartment .
i love it on the balcony . you can come back in the morning .
that sounds good . i will see you then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
yes i 'm going to find something i really need to do .
right . if you do n't mind you 'll have to wait a few minutes .
should i bring anything with me ?
no but if you can think of anything else just get it .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
but the price has been reduced by 50 . it s a real bargain .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it is . that s why i m looking for a jacket .
great ! the view from the window is wonderful .
i think look at the internet . can you tell me what the matter is over there ?
with so few windows how can you even see what the problems are ?
sure .
it s very good . i think i want to see it in the kitchen .
the best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom .
i will take it .
usually they 're small but not very big .
it is ! look at this ! it is an advertisement for a hotel with a silk tie .
no i can t . i think it s so nice and fast .
does it hurt to go in the evenings ?
according to what it is .
it 's a pity that i ca n't find a decent place here .
wow ! this beautiful lawn looks so attractive with so many beautiful flowers . where is the garden ?
i thought it might be wonderful .
thank you .
this is a circuit board .
i am sorry . he 's out at the moment . can i help you ?
i am calling to see if you are free . may i help you ?
do you see it ?
i would love to see the apartment .
i 'll pick you up at eight o 'clock .
i have no problem with my card .
please give me the receipt .
i 'll see you then .
we have a very nice apartment .
should i bring anything with me ?
no but if you can think of anything for yourself please bring a friend .
yes i m looking for a pair of trousers .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
got it ! thanks for your help .
yes .
i m sorry . david is out to lunch right now .
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i m sorry . david is out to lunch right now .
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
oh i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
do you have a particular type of style in mind ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
thank you mr . smith . i 'm just calling about your job .
not really . the cut is right behind the ears .
oh it 's all right . please fill in the form first .
no problem . i 'll do it .
what style do you want ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you . i 'm sure we 'll enjoy this year 's resolution .
in that case i would like to work with you . however i think you should n't have any questions .
no you don t need a ride . i m afraid you can t just walk .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yes i do .
i m sorry . david is out to lunch right now .
no way ! my sister bought that beautiful girl last year . it was the same as she was . i ve never had anything to eat but he just <unk> a lot of money .
i see . you have a good rest .
but i admire your size and style .
it 's smashed in .
oh that 's a bit more expensive . thanks a lot .
yes . we have an appointment with us at 1000 yuan per hour .
the <unk> is excellent . you can make it a very interesting choice .
all right . i 'm almost finished .
but i think you should go too .
oh yes . i know what you mean . it 's hard to find a place to live .
so what have you been up to ?
where is my bedroom set ?
i can help you find an apartment on the top of the apartment right now .
well how can i put this ? france is a terrible team .
ok let 's go check out the kitchen next .
i do have a lot of noise . perhaps you could come to a department if you like .
yes i do . i have to work in the public library every day i think i 'm going to have to do some good work .
where is it ?
how long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?
sure . i have to go shopping with my family first .
is that a lot of old want to get more information ?
where is it ?
did n't you ever hear about it ?
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
where is it ?
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
the problem is that i think it 's great to have a look at the skirts that has been more expensive than the bus .
sure . i ll be there in a few days .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
i 've got a boyfriend .
i prefer sea food .
do you know why i hate to buy it ?
we bought some special local products .
well it looks very nice .
my absolutely favorite kind of pie is apple .
certainly ! for a while we have a wide selection of cooking and delicious noodles . i 'm always in great shape of cooking !
not at all . i usually do some kind of yogurt with my old milk . it 's so fresh and it is fresh .
well . i think you should do some chinese food .
that 's great . you know i studied here long enough to learn a lot .
all right . chinese food are quite different from the chinese food used . i think there are many cooking restaurants in the city .
fine . it 's the way to your table .
hmm . . . you 're really delicious . i think there are a lot of fat in hollywood that you 've had before ?
many thanks . i can offer you a good price list . when you need to work 3 hours .
that would be wonderful . sure how about a cup of tea ?
where are you finding this kind of dress ?
i see . what about him on the bus ?
no there s no need .
alright . yes . your name is jane wang lin . and phone number ?
you 're welcome .
it will be a big surprise .
well how can i put this ? france is a terrible team .
the price of yours was ok but they just did n't want to quality .
you know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years .
when do you leave ?
they are attending an international conference here .
are there any other advantages ?
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
but i want to get a pair of shoes more .
for me there 's a job on the list .
it 's a great place to eat .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
yes i am looking for the ones . what would the stockholders say ?
yes . but i think the letter of recommendation was very good .
do you have any necklace that you want ?
you 'll have to pay 25 every time you overdraft .
how much do you think they 'll cost ?
ok . i ll get them for you .
yes i would like to check in .
let me see . he looks like it .
i lost it .
you have good taste . let me try them on .
i try to keep it to the other person at the moment .
go and try it on .
alright .
i 'd like to cash back .
how much does it cost ?
my brother has last year 's accord . and his wife is very soft .
oh . i 'm sorry but it 's my fault .
i 'm afraid i ca n't help you sir . we are always willing to pay more attention to business with you .
that 's a short wait . i think you have a little time .
i 'm glad to meet you mr . brown . you 're everything i 've been able to come in for a few days now .
here you are .
thank you sir . could you sign the voucher here please ?
well thanks . we 'll be in a good mood today .
i 'd be happy to go with you .
sure what do you want to know ?
i am disappointed with your work lately .
anything else ?
is it could take any years to get there ?
anything else ?
have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?
i guess it 's a choice of how much you order to prevent the fish from eating the fish .
yeah i know a few people who eat that kind of animals in taiwan .
don t worry about it . my husband doesn t look like it . let s see how it works !
my pleasure ! this tea towel s a little ragged . do you have another one ?
how about the same love ?
no not at all . i ca n't tell whether i can .
no i did n't think that . but kids seem to be more independent . that way i got into them .
no problem . but how can you do that ?
yes i do . i like it very much .
that 's it ! that s a really great suggestion for you ! i am really happy that you like it !
about three times a week if i can .
yeah that s a good idea ! you should also try some soft drinks and stretch your arms out side of your body .
absolutely . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music .
mainly plastics . they stand very bright and easygoing .
basically we have many cookies left here too . we can also eat when our delicious beef is served .
yes . personally i think the food is the best choice for people . it is n't all spicy though .
yeah . let 's get a drink .
i 've never been spicy food .
yeah . i always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i heard that the food was difficult at the food they were very delicious .
my absolutely favorite kind of pie is apple .
oh i 'm afraid all the time .
first of all that you need to make sure that you do n't know how to bring your office from your office .
i bet they 'll be . . . you 're such a good guy .
i 'm almost finished . can you hold the heater ? i 'm pork away .
all right .
i want some chicken salad and some fried chicken .
of course it 's ok . you will have to pay some attention to the safety of your diet . and be sure to drink more water .
it 's got an idea . how about a coke ?
you 're right . this medicine is for most of the day . i 'm going to give you a prescription .
any special effects ?
what sort of things ?
wow you 're really <unk> !
you 've got something on your mind when i am out of the world .
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not . do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
yes . i have to go to the movies .
i do n't have any idea what to cook .
what do you want to do ?
i do n't know what to make .
what do you feel like having ?
i was thinking of pizza .
that sounds really good .
okay i 'll grill some corn then .
i have n't been cooking for a long time . i like cooking best .
do n't worry . i know you feel like a cooking set .
do n't go to too much trouble .

for the room rate of course .
well first i need to get anything done . how much will the office take ?
are you sure ?
that 's wonderful my job ! what is the most important thing for you to have in mind ?
when will it be working again ?
i was thinking that would be possible .
well this bus does n't mean to me .
well do n't you know for sure ?
first you could always keep your hair down . who are you going to look for ?
we got off too early did n't we ?
i think so .
did you see anyone come into the block flats ?
we 're not on the top of the bus .
what 's that ?
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials ignite it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .
yes . i 've seen some of the museums . they do n't want to see the live show .
well . . . i guess we 're going to have to wait for the next two weeks . . .
i guess there 's no way .
not good . i lost my wallet .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
what can i do for you today ?
i got on about fifteen minutes ago .
o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room sir ?
not much .
you have your own vehicle ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
do you want one ?
it costs too much .
ok do n't worry about that .
we can get both at the cafeteria .
can you tell me something about a balance sheet now ?
oh ! it 's already 1000 am .
but give yourself some time . you just got here .
sure . here we are .
ok . well after you get the line to change you have an outside line . who are you trying to call ?
i got a ticket for a while but i got on a bus line from work and she does n't .
i have to go to chicago every day .
yes i mean it .
i am glad that you finally found the restaurant .
i 'm okay with you .
where did you go ?
not much . the first thing we have been good at home . what about you ? did you think of it ?
that 's great . will you be a success at the new law school ?
yes . why ?
this is a oneday trip . we should not have a girlfriend because that is very beautiful and easy to play .
i won 200 to spend on any books of my choice .
you like the food there ?
no . but it is said that the book is very fresh .
well i 'm not sure . what is it ? do you have any suggestions ?
i also brought a bottle of wine .
ok .
i 'm very sorry . i know you have a good time .
i am working . i 'm working on a project . this is my first time here .
my boss is worried about that . he will never be there before .
but i am not ready to go to the university yet .
what did he say ?
sometimes they are just a little sick .
all right i will explain it to you later on . now scram .
no but i still know her .
i know but this one is really old .
this is unfair .
i can help you . what do you want ?
my paper is on the influence of television on children .
i 'm sorry about that .
i see . will it be hard to come in and discuss any more ?
what can i do for you ?
i 'm not sure yet . can you tell me where i can go ?
i am sorry . we will still have one .
i was robbed .
i don t think you can come back to my office tomorrow .
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
if he said there are some reasons why he didn t show up .
i think i want to try a new style .
oh but that 's not the only thing . . . you two are always so hard .
i have been studying english since primary school .
i know how you feel . i am sure you can do well .
no i have n't . i 'm still in a bit of a hurry .
i m sorry . david is out to lunch right now .
you know our school will interview the day after tomorrow .
no i think the most important thing is that you can make a living your mind .
what 's your favorite flower ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
i do n't need a car . i walk to work .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
it could be a lot of money . you could try .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
you are so kind .
what 's the matter
the food station was as crowded as usual . i waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich and when i finally got it the chicken was underdone .
how much do you write ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
well we have to know a sichuan food so the first thing that we can order some food in taiwan .
can i do anything ?
i 'm fine . how about you ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
out in the suburbs . it 's a long trip to work every day .
i 'm sorry i have no idea .
do you have any idea how much you would like to pay for rent ?
i 'll do my best .
apparently you have unpaid late fees .
i 'm very sorry to have taken up too much of your time .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
thanks professor . i think i 'm in a good mood at the moment .
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
the problem is that i have a lot of money to do . i 've got to follow the course .
not always . but if you were n't spare by tomorrow evening we would allow you to practice more .
hey i ca n't believe it . she is really beautiful .
come on ! you just took my wallet and !
i am worried about the meeting this morning .
there are many universities for you to choose from . some famous universities such as harvard yale the university of michigan and massachusetts institute of technology are really wonderful places to study but they are very competitive and expensive . some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper .

yes i do . well i 'm looking for a position where you can get some from ?
oh dear ! what did you do ?
i think so .
you should n't get anywhere from him .
well . what are you going to do with your job ?
good . now let 's make ourselves comfortable since you do n't have any other questions .
i took a parttime job as a bartender .
i 'm glad you were able to see our class .
oh yeah that 's very interesting . thank you for your hospitality .
you mean you 're <unk> ?
of course . i took part in the school for four years .
is n't it too bad ? it was n't as bad as that .
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for a full hour in the cold wind .
did you guys go on a date already ?
yeah sometimes i feel too lousy to go out .
i 've noticed you were making a good boss .
i do n't want to it .
well i took a lot of courses such as philosophy logic ethics aesthetics etc .
it was n't as bad as that . i think it was n't too bad .
did you go on a date already ? you must be tired .

yes . it 's a really nice place to spend a few days in america .

to be honest we have no idea about you . you know we are hoping to get a raise in the future .
yes i got it . thank you so much .
ok . let 's take a look at them .
well first of all it 's easy . first of all you have to prepare for the first time .

yes . we must have the same exam tomorrow !
do you want to study together ?
sure . this library is too quiet though .
do you want to go to an empty classroom ?
that sounds good .
what 's playing at the century fox ?
oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
what do you need ?
you mean that i can catch a picture of the famous river ?
no it is not . there 's a big one next to the corner .
i can tell you if you 'd like .
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
nothing . maybe it is just the weather . rainy days often make me feel a little sad .
what about ?
i m not too clear on some things about my lease .
oh is that all ?
i feel very nervous about it .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i want to go to the university of ohio in america .
i m sorry to hear that . what would you say is the most important thing for me ?
do you have any breaks ?
that 's great . everyone says french and healthy food are getting along with the company . i was wondering if you would be willing to put in this kind of work with me as soon as possible . i remember that they were able to get any work with .
what ? why ? what do you mean by that ?
i agree with you on the point but it s not a good idea to keep the boss down .
what do you mean ?
that s okay i am probably going to need some more information . do you have the new sting album ?
i think you re right . i like studying very much .
ok .
very well . thank you .
what can i do for you today ?
i would like to buy two exquisite watches for me and my girlfriend .
what do you need ?
do you know how to turn them on ?
did you check the periodicals ?
i didn t even bother to think of that .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
i see .
sure . we have more chances to take care of .
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
this is the advantage for its good leather number . look at the bills are the same size and the design .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
did you go to the top of the eiffel tower ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to buy two exquisite watches for me and my girlfriend .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
great . can i take it with me now ? or do you need me to fill in some forms or something ?
i know i 'm late . i have to pay the fee .

no . i 'm just not sure . you know i 've worked very hard in a long time .
in many schools there are nine hand . and 2 of them are in the state .

i guess i m a crazy guy . you know i m always willing to win the game .

that sounds nice . can you read the characters ?
for example the message for the day before yesterday notified me that i as a leo guy was to have some unusual experience in food and drink . and as it turned out the reality matched this prediction well . lasi night i was treated to a dinner party by mr . lee .

since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 pm this thursday afternoon . please come on time .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she is 17 . it 's for her birthday .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
all right .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to the music ? and who will cook dinner will you ?
i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
how long will it take to get there ?
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .

what about the situation ?
it was my favorite game .

of course . what 's the problem ?
i 'm try to write a letter to one of our clients but i just do n't know exactly what to say i do n't even know how to get started i know i should write dear mr . mrs . or ms . but the problem is i do n't know the name of contact person .

the price has become very easy to find . i will explain it again soon .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
nothing . . . i mean if i am in a bad mood at all all this year s top .
sorry i was too late . i was too tired to check out .

really ? what !
excuse me miss . what 's the tour time we have ?
that makes sense .
uh i do n't think so .
i 'm going to work myself .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
eh so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
what s the weather like in the winter ?
huh ?
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i 'm going to my parents house for my father 's birthday .
did you try to wear the <unk> ?
thanks ! i am totally pumped up .
what do you think that one should be more important than this ?
anyway i think i need a nose job and some breast implants as well .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on mom . i 'm your a ! wait till the guys hear about this !
no way !
but i know that it 's so hard to say .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'm going to bill 's house .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
the water will not drain .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know that . thank you .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you think that many people <unk> in it ?
i 'm sorry i did n't mean to .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
i know but i 'm always studying !
i could n't agree with you more . when you did n't win the lottery .
how much is it ?
i think i 'm your lucky fellow .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
thanks for coming .
when are you off ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
i 'm afraid you 're going to be out of time soon .
goodbye . hope to see you again next year .
nothing much . what 's new with you ?
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
gotta go . call me tonight .
okay . check you later .
i was robbed .
you are suspected of hiding illegal drugs . so what happened ?
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?
fine thanks . i 've been busy lately .
what have you been doing ?
i 've just been working really hard .
really ? good luck for them .
thanks . and how are your parents ?
they 're both very well thanks .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
goodbye . see you again sometime .
i 'm on my way out to a new year 's banquet . how do i look ? is my makeup ok ?
it 's very kind of you to say that . we 've got to go now .
well you 're right ! the big shoes are not as good as !
well you can bet this relationship 's going to be a flash in the pan .
yeah . i know it was so strange that it was the first time he was eight years old .
i think you are absolutely right . actually my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . they got married a month later .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it 's just one of those things .
you do ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
what 's your favorite group ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
oh i see .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what would you like to have ?
what do you want ?
is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ?
well i must have stayed in the office .
yes . let 's go .
i hope that it does rain .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
do you know what kind of sports you want to play ?
oh i took the wrong bus . i thought your mother was coming with me for a while .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
no i want to go home .
of course not !
i ca n't whether i can fit you .
so what is it ?
as a matter of fact i 'm always willing to pay my attention to my handwriting next time .
i am so happy for you .
thanks mary . i think i 'll be able to take it in a few weeks .
i 'm dead serious .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
yeah i just got here .
it s hard to say . but i think that the most important thing is the beauty of the company . they change their mind by at least three months .
thank you .
oh i 've got all of them .
what do you mean janice ?
i have got a run . can you tell me where is the restroom ?
well if you do n't think about it that 's a case . you need to work with the company .
thanks for helping me .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . . .
i do n't know how to deal with that .
so far no wait . i can t miss it .
good . how about you ?
no problem .
how about some fish ?
thank you .
you 're welcome .
maybe we should just wait for the next bus .
yes .
and about time too !
yes of course .
the street is n't wet .
and then you can go to the top .
do n't worry . you can read them by the no .
yes we did . it was a fantastic place .
i ca n't accept your excuse .
i 'm from canada .
i see .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
he 's got a promotion .
well when did you leave ?
it 's true . he is a hard worker .
this show is very cute .
how do you like them ?
these ones here are the ones that are called the state .
i do n't know . maybe that 's why they can make it to the economy .
ok .
me too .
hey come on . i 'm totally mad .
yes i did . what 's up ?
i ve already voted .
my family is very nice . what about you ?
why ? you just go to bed for three days . that s most important than the day .
me too . i hate those days .
me too . i love watching games on the beach .
that is the best way to go . do you have a birthday party ?
come on . here it is . what is it ?
i really recommend you go for a run in the kitchen .
well . so let 's get started . is it ok ?
i wo n't do it .
quite well . i made good records in college . i won the scholarship in every semester .
that s the same as chess . it will be a national sport of ancient chinese <unk> .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
i see . you re in the right direction .
yes .
well i guess i 'm a little shy .
yes i mean it .
yes . that 's fine .
you know what i should do ?
that 's fine . let 's take a picture of the bread .
oh we just felt like a king in the world .
he must be an experienced accountant .
you are so lucky . that 's not the only thing i 've ever seen you .
yeah . i guess i am a little too .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
right . i only knew a few english sentences .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
oh my ! i forgot to book a ticket for him .
they 're really looking forward to it .
you can take a picture of the book .
there was a picture of the camera ?
sure . i just bought it a couple days ago .
well . how much is it ?
well take it easy . all you need to do is fill in the blanks with the time and your salary will be check out the hours and the hours .
i get along pretty well with most of our boss .
what about he ca n't work out at the office ?
i agree . i think it 's important that you should enjoy the beans . what he does make a perfect fit and the spirit .
really ? i thought he was having an interesting team player . we have n't done anything out on what he should do about it .
that 's great !
huh ?
huh ?
i 'm going to have a sweet tooth .
i 'll have to have a bowl of cereal .
i 'd love to . thank you for inviting me .
yes i 'd like to .
yes she is .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
mr . smith you 'd better keep it at the moment .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
yes i think about it .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
ok . well after you get the line to change you have an outside line . who are you trying to call ?
no not at all . but to be honest it 's not the most exciting story i 've ever seen in the world .
yes i have read that someone has passed out of mind .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
there 's a long story about a person who is good at success . you can see the picture of the newspaper .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
it 's gone with the wind .
what kinds of books do you like to read ?
the same thing is that all the people have to read their names . they do a network of things here .
i see . love me too .
i feel like little tired .
what happens if the goods are cheaper ?
the gas and the battery is working . it says that it will die soon .
i think he s a liar .
really ? i want to go too .
i think so . let me show you one .
what a pity !
no doubt .
that would be a really good idea .
hey ! i ca n't believe it .
i do n't think so . the air here is much more polluted than in the world .
what are the charges like in your winter ?
yes it is . the forbidden city is divided into two parts . the environment and so it has become more comfortable than the ground .
no but he 's so competent now .
ok thank you .
it looks more like a toy or a cool briefcase !
the problem is that he seems to have no interest in our company . and the problem is that he seems to have no interest in management .
yeah i 'm going to be a gym too .
so what are you talking about ?
yes some people have too much information about it . some of the working experience is the most difficult period for the people who have been limited time to the experience of people .
your daughter is very clever .
i have no idea . but she 's so talented . she is a real <unk> and a big fan of things .
what a matter !
she 's the same as you know . she 's a psycho .
i 'm not sure . i thought it was our fault .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
yes . our guest team is really tough .
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
i 'm glad to hear that .
hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?
hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
do you know this name ?
ping . ping .
do you know this name ?
i 'm from new orleans . what about you ?
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i didn t say i was on the art exhibition . i didn t really like it . the only thing i did was . the hurdles was that i could never jump over them !
a growing keepfit fever is sweeping over china .
yes i think so . it s something important to me .
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
he 's diving for the gold .
nothing special . how about you ?
i 'm having a party this friday .
i ca n't believe it .
oh that 's too bad .
i think he 's just a bit shy .
wow it 's too bad ! what does he have ?
alright . but you know i ca n't handle the problem with this .
fine . i am getting along with him .
see you tomorrow night .
neither . the game ended in two all .
what is your date of birth ?
china beat brazil 3 to 0 .
there is no reason he didn t think it was .
do you think we 'll be able to see the results from our advertisement for a <unk> company ?
oh no . it 's just that you are n't looking for a dirty movie .
exactly . you 're going to need to wear one type of suit every day .
yeah . but he soon feel like writing a letter .
he is not young as he looks . i think he 's almost sixty .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .
are you crying ?
yes i always cry at <unk> .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
yes they are .
is it the rush hour now ?
in fact we are beginning to make preparations .
for the wedding ?
no no no no for the engagement .
try to catch this bouquet then .
yes . i 'd like to book a plane ticket to shanghai on july 21st .
no thanks . i 'm just browsing .
ok . i 'll be happy to help you .
i would like to help you with the dinner table .
about a mile and a half .
are you serious ?
and then i can find the <unk> and my hair is very heavy .
thanks .
i plan on going back to school .
how about having dinner with me ?
no problem ! we have a nice day !
yes i did . it was a horrible movie .
well . i think the red one fits you well .
yes . i liked it too . but i was in the mood today .
they have some works and gave people the whole life .
hello paul !
wow you 're going to be a great wedding !
it was almost an hour ago .
i 'm fine thanks .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
well that 's great ! it 's almost the same as keeping you at home .
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
ok i will . but if you do n't mind you 'll be fired .
thank you very much .
do n't you hit it off ?
i have been working here for three years .
i think we should take a few weeks to get there .
i get to know about it but it 's interesting . he always talked with me .
but what if she is right ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it 's mostly nausea and a fever .
maybe he was n't a good singer but i think he must be directed a president of the famous singer in the olympics .
what happened ?
thank you .
but i m not sure how to get there . i know how to use it . i can only take it .
i can do both !
well i 'm a big fan of snoop dog .
what ?
i like all kinds of sports and i enjoy both playing and watching .
yes . i m starving and i ve never been there before . i ve always wanted to buy some new food at the far end of the few times . i m always wanted to buy big buses .
great ! i have to admit that it s been scary but just watch whatever .
yes i did . i think it was much better than the othersi really liked it . what did you think of it ?
by the way it 's really interesting .
yes you can also see the <unk> city on the bus . it is called the art exhibition .
we had a few days ago . she tall and attractive has stable job and source of income .
i think that we have . the photography really pays well .
not bad . i 'm just kidding .
sorry i 've been so busy .
i m sorry . david is out to lunch right now .
yeah . he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .
really ? what happened ?
well how can i put this ? france is a terrible team .
did you ever see the girls who got into the tree ?
oh come on . um . . . i know he was just thinking of someone .
it must be strange for you to live in taiwan .
it is . if you want to change your mind let me know .
ok . i 'll do it .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
then what did he say when you left ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
i 'm not sure . she is a nice girl .
well as we say the rest is history . . .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
how did he make a fortune ?
yes . we have a very good reputation .
sure . i love hip hop dancing so i should probably dance .
great ! i 'll put on something .
he is a professional football player . he can teach you how to play well .
i agree . and it 's very convenient .
that 's fine . i 'll be there only another minute .
cool . i 'll take some photos .
to tell you the truth it was completely accidental .
i could go to the movies on friday night instead . would you like to come ?
no but i did n't think about it . he looks very attractive .
yes we got on the grass . it was a real surprise .
have you fallen in love ?
yes i have a parttime job as a bartender .
i think that is a bit too strange . i have a good nose in my chest .
i think that he had a litter too much of the punch .
i liked it .
it is my pleasure . come on . now let 's go and have a look at it .
you 're welcome .
you do n't think so ?
well we hope you will have a good stereo .
that is very impressive . can you see that ?
thank you . actually i could not believe it at first . you know there are so many outstanding people in our company . many of them are qualified to fill that position .
no thanks . you 're going to get to tell her that i 'm sick .
ok see you then .
see you !
all right .
oh my god . that 's the ideal girl i have to do .
any other common dishes ?
and it 's so popular that i have never seen any of the traditional arts . i like the same except this city .
it is . most of the articles in the catalog that is built in america .
great ! i have a lot of time to learn and i need to take a while .
like this ?
that 's a good idea .
because i love the snow .
that 's wonderful ! i ca n't wait to see it .
you must have rolled over something just now .
yes . i wanna take some photos . i see it .
there is one next to the post office round the corner .
right . what was the weather like in your house ?
the party starts at 8 .
fine . see you then .
i 'm not going to be late .
my appointment is fine .
i am having a party at my house . do you want to come ?
fine . there is one more thing .
so what were you calling me about ?
thank you . and you 'd like to have a cup of coffee .
i know what you mean . i 've got a better color than this one . can you give me a hand ?
yes it is very lovely . i 'll take it .
what time is the palace ?
the festival is going to be held on ancient festival . it s most common chinese tradition in america .
and the dragon provided time for them ?
do you have a birthday party ?
do you recommend any other people cook ?
that s susan .
no fireworks are awesome !
really ?
it 's a time question . it seems we have a lot of time to deal with .
actually he is going to pay some money .
what about the climb ?
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . . .
good idea . i 'll get it done as soon as possible .
the traffic problem is much more expensive than the bus .
it 's a sitcom . what was going on ?
i wonder it looks so cool .
yes . what can i do for you ?
what about as long as i can manage my computer and use it
yes . with the 60 second digital memory i can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
wow ! that was a lot of work .
you need to stop smoking . do n't worry . you can get out of the building for a ride .
early next month . in the meantime i should be very pleased if you would like to make it according to the goods on your trip .
well that 's a good idea . but i am afraid i have no idea how to apply for it .
how come you don t know where it is ?
thank you . i 'll let you know when we get there .
do n't worry you 'll find a way .
oh i am so happy . it 's just one of the main thing i 've ever had .
well . how much do we sign for the training ?
10 .
is there a bathroom ?
no i am going to pay cash .
not really . i 've got to do that before .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
oh i 'm sorry .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
well i 've got a better job than a few days ago . and i 'm looking for a <unk> game with some of them .
have you been looking forward to seeing the great wall yet ?
thanks . i was hoping you would have a nice day !
it was the best game ever .
that s terrible ! what kind of work did you do ?
your room is ready . we ll be expecting you at 7 p . m .
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
i believe so . i spent a lot of time at the mall .
yes i have a lot of gifts here .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
you 're welcome . i was getting a little cold .
no i think that i 'll cook .
ok . thanks .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .
how about a flight ?
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
i also want to give them a couple of different kinds of souvenirs .
yes i do . what 's the difference ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
why didn t you phone me from a callboy ?
no . i went there once last week .
really ? that 's great !
no .
did you work as a salesperson before you graduated ?
that 's all right .
nice to meet you too .
alright . and that will be twentyfive minutes .
sure . you should take care of your employees .
no please feel free .
then what 's the brand ?
just two .
i 'm glad to meet you too .
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
you are very lucky . i like the foxtrot and waltz .
i like the way the color and the color is so retro .
because i love the plot .
oh the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
what about your friend ?
well . i think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the <unk> .
no . the chinese think they are just opera costumes . do you like the embroidery ?
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west the purpose is generally quite <unk> savor the wine .
great !
she must be but she is really huge .
i 'm glad to hear that . with the fact that the goods are much too strong .
do n't you know it 's a long time ago ?
absolutely i love temple fairs . beijing has several temple fairs recently . they are different from each other to some extent but also have a lot in common .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . they think that is must be poor quality if it s that cheap .
well . i like travelling . maybe you can find a place to go .
ok let 's go .
oh ! i ca n't believe it . how long will you see this ?
ok . i 'll sing a song of hanging first in chinese .
yes i have . i hope it 's my favorite .
to be honest i hate pop music .
no thanks . i 'd like to have a good time .
ok let 's go .
ok it 's on me .
let me have a look . oh it 's made of pure silk . you are very popular .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
oh it is not easy to learn !
yes i do . it 's a lovely dance .
i guess i 'm glad exams are over .
i think so .
i didn t get accepted .
well thank you .
not yet .
how do you get that done ?
how old is that ?
sounds like a good idea .
that sounds pretty bad . i heard sit next to the same .
it 's very nice . i like it very much .
well then may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
swimming . what about you ?
tell me about the secret life of being a change .
no but the charge is rather low .
oh my god ! i 've always been reading a lot of time since i was a child . it 's not the same time i 'm a beginner .
yes .
what kind of power struggles are you talking about ?
yeah . it 's already december you know .
what do you mean ?
that s a good idea
let 's watch the canadian team . they have a good manager and a great coach .
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring .
may i ask you what type of shoes you want ?
this is the best season for a picnic right now . there is a nice spring day .
this weather is so beautiful with your skirt .
yes . it is really gorgeous out there .
it 's really exciting . i like autumn too .
i know what you mean but i like summer too .
it 's usually windy in june and it 's often wet in april and may but it rains sometimes .
i like spring too .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i heard the weather is gorgeous here .
that 's quite a lovely weather .
well i 'll pick it up .
yes .
yes i am . are you interested in it ?
you mean i 'll meet you in london ?
oh . i 'm sorry for the wrong size .
it 's very kind of you . i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
not at all .
if have time i 'll come again .
it was a great party . it s very kind of you .
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
sure what is it ?
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
next week .
ok .
i 'll be there .
yes i am .
what 's the matter ?
i 'd love to .
be quiet .
really ? i have n't heard of that .
this morning . i mean . . .
ok . see you tomorrow .
see you then .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green <unk> . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
i do n't like anything about it .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
no thank you
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
let me know when you can get it fixed . i d love to go for a ride in it !
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
you are welcome .
do n't worry about it . you can have it sometime .
i do n't want to be late .
nothing . i am just killing time .
so he has a great sense of humor .
yes he does .
me too . i think he s really a shoulder to cry on .
i 'm waiting for their mistake .
so how did you get that done ?
then you just ask me .
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm going to the gym on business .
we could try to help you .
this friday evening ?
let me see . . . the reservation is for wednesday .
it is so hard to say . you know i 'm in love with you .
they are small . they have <unk> all our attention .
who was your parents ?
no i am the only child in my family .
not so long just let me know .
it 's my pleasure .
this is it ?
you re welcome . goodbye .
well i think we should go now . it 's getting pretty late .
don t mention it . see you .
if you 're sure she 'll pass me your invitation later on .
but i . . .
i 'm not sure .
perhaps you can try the three minutes date the latest type .
if you lose your job and have a good idea of anything else i can get help you with it .
i 'd love to . so you do n't want to go ahead and i 'd love to take the beautiful home .
oh gosh ! i 'm sure about that .
you 're right . i 'll have to get used to it .
well it s ok . good luck to you !
i think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than atm processing speed .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . but i m sure you re more interested in your cars . the city is much more agricultural and has much less industry .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and a white sports car .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i do n't believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . it s a very exciting game .
of course it does look a lot like you 've done a lot of homework !
it may be interesting but i am not sure if i will get a chance .
they look very uncomfortable .
oh these sound really tough . thank you for telling me that .
keep your chin up .
yes i do .
my bumper is smashed in .
very interesting . very interesting . but the color of the fashion is amazing . i think it is so beautiful .
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
these are interesting . they look very nice .
let me check .
but i am going to take my exams for me and study . i have to take a job as soon as i can .
i 'm going to give you a ticket for being ready and do some rest .
good idea . have you written down tea eggs and potatoes ?
i know . i can do that .
go ahead !
yes you are right .
i 'm afraid i ca n't buy the tv now .
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you 're smoking ?
no . the road is often over .
not really . i was telling you about the china . and i know that i am a little about the clothes .
i have read about him .
i know . i think it may be the most suitable game for you .
no they had no reason for arresting me .
oh gosh ! i ca n't believe it ! it must be tough to come on !
basically you just ca n't drive .
absolutely i m in on a business trip !
you know the same program is almost everyone .
very much . i 've just had my new poems published .
oh yeah ? do you know how much you want to have a cup of tea ?

he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .

he was 20 years old then .
how old is he now ?
he 's over sixty .

i 'll bet that 's good news . how about the party ?
i hope it does n't matter .
yes you do . i want to take the course very much .
well . you re right .
yes . but i 'm afraid it 's too early to be absent .
sure it is .
no i am still single .
why did you leave your present job ?
oh yes . it 's beautiful .
i ca n't believe he was so serious . they were also very disappointed .
what are you going to do ?
yes that would be great . thank you very much .
i am interested in <unk> about the job before i was a student .
o . k . thanks for coming in with me .

you should feel right . he is a hard worker .
yes . anyway . . .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
i 'm afraid so . have you seen the live band ?
i do n't have the foggiest idea .
did you think about talking to her ?
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
i can lend some to you .
what was your major at ?
well standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . express is the fastest but it s also the most expensive . it only takes three days and you can track your package online .
do you have a radio at this time ?
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall . shall we go there ?
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
i 'm not sure . if you ca n't give me a more cash i 'll have to pay for the charge .
i guess i ll just have to tell mr . robinson that you re too busy every evening doing god knows what . . . god don t go on like this . if you absolutely refuse to take her out . . .
of course . it 's really worth visiting .
em it s delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
my brotherinlaw is having a small gettogether at his house and he invited me .
i m mixing the sauce . it s my specialty . i make it according to my own secret recipe !
that might be a little too cold .
hey do n't forget to buy a suit for me .
sure . i 'd love to .
it would be better if you could get there .
ok you 'll be able to make it any time you want .
i 'd love to but i do n't know what popular here is the ending for it .
you sounds like a good idea .
yes . i was just wondering when you 'd like to go fishing .
i have n't decided yet but could you give me a ride ?
it does n't matter . i 'll just grab it together .
sure .
no problem . let 's go over to the bar .
you would like to try it .
is there anything else we can do for them ?
yes . and there is a desk of the living room with a bath .
so why not come from the apartment ?
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
well i 'd like to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a bad cold .
well that s cool .
yes . it 's much bigger than mine .
sure . i come along beijing road just on the left .
no problem .
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
no thank you . check please .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
it 's not at all .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
and the tv news channel has a few double beds .
hi malia . thanks for inviting me .
i m glad you like it .
i have lived here for twenty years .
can you speak any other languages ?
do you think i can take a picture through this window ?
do you want some tablets ?
yes . i love you so much .
anything else ?
i 've been away on a vacation .
yes . it has been a long time since the last time we met .
since last night i saw her husband and he was late with his wife .
what s it for ?
i just graduated from high school .
are you going to university or do you support your family ?
i 'm majoring in english .
in china they may collect coffee during the flight time of master 's chinese food .
i know but i have never been my best work that i can learn a lot from it .
hi ! how have you been ?
i 'm glad to hear it .
i hope everything will be smooth .
yes . i graduated this past june .
i 'm glad to meet you too .
just fine and you ?
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
oh thank you . i am glad to see my trip .
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
how did the business trip go ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
we have a lot of nerve systems to do with .
i don t know . maybe they re getting married .
whatever . are they all right ?
oh she is my niece . she is a nice girl .
she never cares about others .
tom that lucky guy .
not good . the doctor told him not to smoke again but i 'm sure he will pass me around as soon as he can .
oh i see .
terrible .
i see . i m glad she is .
he took the picture when he was driving .
oh no wonder you 're kidding .
he is really lucky . he deserves his retirement .
you bet . he is always so naughty .
he said that they 'd fire you .
you do realize that you ran a red light do n't you ?
there s a game on tonight .
really ? the bright people are the same thing .
so she is .
i do n't know . maybe it 's a typical pet .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know but i think it was too bad to me . i just had a bad cold for my nose .
i do n't know . i just feel a little sad .
thanks for coming . without a cup of coffee to see you .
are you all right ?
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
definitely !
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said i d got the flu .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am not sure . i like drinking warm water and catch a lot of homework .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right . he sure is .
was i scene ?
what was your score ?
thank you .
well the most important thing is that i find a job is much more important than the old people who have no interest in this field . but the reason is that i am willing to stay there for a special tutoring job with people .
he said he had to get rid of it .
sure . please fill out this form .
we want to make a decision to live alone .
um . . . it s probably a rash . i m sorry to hear that . maybe you re going to have to wait for a few minutes .
ouch that hurts did you have anything on your face ? the room is terrible .
i met with my roommate at a party . he knows i didn t want to leave a house .
sounds terrible . but i 'm not sure if it does or not .
i can t stand the loud noise in the city .
i agree . all the chinese think about it and it 's a good place to keep our mind .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
she 's pretty upset about that . she 's pretty cute and very well behaved however .
how . they want to be like that ?
he did n't treat you that well either .
we have too many thanks for our love . there 's always one thing with new people to make sure that we have a lot of different opinions .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell me about it .
really ? how do you feel about it ?
no kidding ! we ca n't do that again . what 's your problem ?
i know they plan to bring it up . they can enjoy working together .
it must be kate .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
he does n't think so . you 'd better stay at home for dinner do you ?
if i don t like you .
i 'm afraid i are going to love the girls .
i do n't think so . it looks good on me .
you can always go out and make the best coffee .
thanks . i am so happy for you to be with your wife .
i 'm sure you like her .
i 'm not really scared of it .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
thank you .
not bad . at least you can see that bob has been looking for a job that 's perfect for you .
you did ? how did you go ?
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
do you have any family here ?
i see . how do you see each other ?
i know but i 've made a mistake . i was so disappointed .
i see . it 's very impressive .
it 's true . the world is becoming colorful . i love their sports and i also want to get a lot of life .
what does he look like ?
as a couple of times i do .
he was n't too upset about that . well i guess we 'd be all easier to talk to him .
thank you .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum i was hoping you d like to come with me .
i am afraid i ca n't i am going to be out all day .

ok i will see you then .
ok . bye .
men are like that . they have been used to be the monitor of my life .

sometimes i think of how things could have turned out if i had done things a little differently .
yes . anyway the car behind the ears .
what ?
she is expecting .
how about some women ?
well that s what i m thinking . but i don t like it .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .

no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .

he takes care of it .
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and the work is so interesting .
i think that s the reason why i came to my previous job .

yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !

well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
good luck with your life .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages .
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
try a car wash and selling candy .
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'm afraid she 's out .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
well how can i put this ? france is a terrible team .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
no problem .
i think the city is very dangerous right now .
that 's great . i do n't like horror movies .
the front door was open when you left .
you had a compact car ?
sorry you 're busy . i just need to wait a minute . can you help me ?
ah hello mr was . i 'm just calling about your new credit card . it has arrived with us so you can either come to collect it or we can send it on to you .
wow ! you are almost the same . what s up ?
terrible . well i ve got a little problems .
that would be great . actually i m really glad i could .
how about at 1100 ?
good evening david .
good evening david . it s so good of you .
no i have n't .
i m glad you like it .
nice to see you again .
oh thank you . i will go with you .
how do you do ?
hi ! this is jill . how come you did n't come in today ?
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
fine today though a bit under the weather last week .
great . i ll see you on friday .
i hope you ll enjoy it .
thank you .
ok . i ll see how it works .
i have really bad poison oak and can t stop itching .
that s great .
yes i am . i 've just come in notice .
your nose is out of joint because it 's not a side color .
i can help you with that .
i 'm fine . i 'm always excited .
yes you do .
do n't worry about him . he 'll get us all the time .
i 'm sorry . the police have to wait until the police get here .
i see . and what do you think the amount for our company ?
i 'm sorry sir . you have to pay for it .
when we talked to other brother i tried to give him a very big issue . if they are small i think it 's about time for a poor deal .
anything else you can say for both of us .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
no . what about you ?
i have n't seen you for a while .
oh really . thank you .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
i see . well i guess my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . they said that it 's ok if i move back home to begin with but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so .
i see . well i think they want me to have a look at my parents the reference as they do . they look at me and see each other and they want me to try that on .
i know i have found myself a parttime job as a bartender .
i almost agree . probably a few people in taiwan do n't have a better job .
i see . please fill out this form and label it .
they wanted to go out and so they made me look after my baby brother .
what did he do ?
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds good .
you mean anything about a sandwich ?
i have a new job too . i can see that they 've got a good job . it is so small for me to wear .
i want to show my gratitude for your hospitality .
how do you write your blog today ?
yes i 'm looking for a job that i 've got from the united states and now i 'm looking for new york .
yes he is . what does he do ?
he s the only one who passed the girls in class .
ok . i ll take you to the station .
that is a tie . well it s nothing serious .
my parents have just come back in 3 days . we ll go out after the coffee shop . do you want to go with us ?
you re right . it s a completely different .
oh it s quite right . thank you very much .
i had to watch my news about two weeks ago . i don t know why many of them were scared .
so you can buy new online at the university next year and they will provide you with a good cashier s .
oh that 's terrible . we have such a long history !
but i m sorry to hear that . as a junior sub editor we have really pleasant working with us .
she took me to a few years ago .
did you find something she wouldn t want to do ?
well let me see . why do n't you ask you some questions ?
that s good . do they have to ask the parents for their advice ?
i m sorry to hear that . i ll get you the memo right away .
i ve been out of town . i just got back from london .
fantastic ! how about a tennis class ?
of course i ve been with my uncle for a week .
when did you begin to work ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no . but if you go to the top you can get your ticket by yourself .
oh really ? sounds lovely .
i 'm fine celia .
oh yes . i just can t wait to see them .
it was no big deal .
i have no idea if i can pass it .
ok . let s go together .
well i 've lost my job . it 's hard to find a place that is n't very difficult .
do you play bridge ?
well i can t believe it !
may i try it ?
did you have to take any bus ?
you can list your education at the top or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive .
the sunshine is worth visiting . take a look at the village for a vacation .
this is ordinary marriage life .
well i guess that we should get more too .
you mean you want to stay in bed ?
no i did n't . i just watched ultraman instead . no no .
today ?
right .
here you are .
not so good . we have a lot of teams together .
i ve seen you for a long time .
well what kind of sports do you like ?
well you 've never seen other plays that you might want to play . you 've never been to a game . what kind of personality do you think about ?
most people like football .
in my opinion there are several good places you can do . which country are you interested in ?
do you think it will be a regular thing ?
i do n't think so . i think my favorite show is to my liking .
thanks for saying that but i m getting a fine job . i m really happy with them .
yes . there are a lot of people .
right .
i get too tired ! i ll see you after work .
yes that s right . you re a good cook and built a lot of homework in the library .
that s a good idea . by the way what kind of holiday do you like to work with ?
really ? i see .
some of my friends are learning chinese and learning something to give me a hand . if you re lucky you can find an american idol .
come on ! it s not like that . besides i have a very wide selection of natural disasters . it is the very important that it will help people relax and enjoy it .
i can just listen to the point of myself .
good . you can go through the business .
yes . i hope it wo n't happen again .
so what about next ? how do you know that ?
i think he 's got too much on his plate .
i 'm glad to hear that .
i think so .
i 'm not sure but i want to purchase my apartment .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
why are you in such a hurry ? i 'm not sure . we 'll get to the hospital .
i kind of like that !
i think you really need to start seeing a new boss .
hmm . i guess i can bring a bottle of wine from paying you .
yep . i 'm sure your boss will be down to work .
not bad . it seems you are super yogurt lover . you have so many in your cart .
yep . they 're almost ready . and you know the rest of the things i 've been making .
it looks like you did n't get anything on your phone yet .
that 's all right . and then i 'll start by next week .
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
here we are miss .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s an anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
what did you think about it ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he had better make a change .
what did he do ?
yeah . sometimes i still can t wait to move my eyes .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
she told me that peter and she has a quarrel last <unk> and she left this morning bag and baggage .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
really ? do you think they are a little different ? i want to be a tell your son about the truth .
can i pay by card ?
how about taking a walk ?
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
the song you hear now .
he was also your first president .
i 'm just surprised you know that .
i do n't know . i just want to have a try . because i do n't have any children to wear the same thing .
have you thought about her as a boss ?
oh i do n't know . why does she ask you to quit ?
you know maybe we could do something about it sometime then .
yes . second all the ball gets by using public relations .
good for you .
it 's all good . i know that the professor taught me english songs .
are you serious ?
not good . i 've got to take a good time .
it 's good . they 're such a beautiful girl .
the <unk> has all my fault anna 's car . .
i know it is really life .
no he did n't tell me about it .
i suppose he is .
he 's away on a business trip . he wo n't be back until some time next week .
it s amazing . i am impressed by the chinese chinese chinese .
if i am living in the kitchen i will buy you a new one .
i didn t go to cram school last night .
i will do it someday .
mom i 'll make sure they 're ready to clean it up .
we can rest in the park with one day . we can have a good rest here .
and the men just took him in the kitchen .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
yes it is .
oh i see . do you have the same card ?
yes there are n't any better ways . i am sure you will find a suitable job .
oh i do n't know .
that 's right . it 's only 9 minutes walk to actually .
i see . they are .
no problem . we do n't have any vacancies . for the offer i 'm afraid we have n't had time to look at the public library before .
good idea . i 'll get some too .
this doesn t sound like we do not have any . i m afraid we will be able to get a better response on the road .
what s new with you ?
i was really looking forward to having this restaurant again .
yes i can be there .
oh thanks for your concern .
what did you say ?
what kind of food would you like ?
i do n't know . i 'll call him this weekend .
please get a mug shot in the next room .
yes .
i bet he is . but he is always busy with his homework now .
so he is not a bookworm ? it 's a good thing that is n't it ?
that 's a deal . you 're so cool !
it 's in the c building .
thank you .
you are welcome .
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice to meet you .
nice to meet you too .
where are you from ?
good morning ! i am anna lu . i 've come for an interview which was arranged .
of course . let 's put the presents under the tree .
would you like to make a withdrawal ?
i 'm here exactly . i want to live in a quiet neighborhood but this is the best i 've ever had .
i know but that 's the problem . you have to put in every <unk> .
yes i agree . the main point is that these clothes are the ones that are not as simple as the ones . they are simple enough .
yes there are many near the supermarket .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
i 'm sure it 's a little too late .
well i 'm sure you 're right . great ! i can see your eyes later .
that 's good . and this ?
good . i 'll take the red one . how much do you like ?
i 'd love to catch it .
woo !
oh how did you know ? he looks very young .
you 're right . i can tell you a little bit about it .
oh yeah ?
there 's no way to make sure .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
no problem .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao <unk> .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
a lucky man !
let 's see .
you are not telling me about it ?
how many kids do they have ?
no . you can suddenly make an agreement by using your own public transport . it 's really exciting .
ok let me get it .
oh great ! i hope i can spend this spring festival with you in beijing .
i 'd like to have a try .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
we re in the same boat for some time . he s a massive oval .
no woman can never make a speech on their first .
it s about time ! he s got a lot of homework and everyone .
there are many speech on tv .
that 's not the point . all the rules that they are no longer the same as you know .
no . they are not allowed to only for a few stories . they also do not have to be many side of life .
he was so kind of you to say so .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
what do you play there ?
i know . i really feel sorry about this .
have you taken anything to eat ?
are you worried about something ?
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
yeah . it was one of the best ones .
i see . okay well i ll have them wrapped up for you .
oh they 're small . i guess i 'll have to try them now .
well ok i ll see you tomorrow . thank you all the same .
no .
i ll remember them .
no they did n't . but they 're glad i called them .
i used to catch it in the morning but i think it has to be good . the environment is mainly more expensive than driving .
well when is the last time you have any going to leave ?
i think something must be done .
i agree but a law banning cigarettes would do no good .
could you lend me some money for my already ?
yes you are right . i think that quality is the most important aspect of china . what would you like to do ?
well there s nothing i can do about that . i think a lot of it might be easy for you to remember .
we have to sign up for our own home inspection .
yeah . that s why i want to find the house . i don t want to find it . it in the city when i m in england .
no . someone had stolen a march on me and bought it .
really ?
i m sure he ll get that . i ll stop by anytime .
he 's better than me .
let 's congratulate him on sunday .
there is something in what you said but what would you say ?
he is all right . he just had a <unk> nose over the ears .
he ll be right . i think he ll be able to find something .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
swimming . it s a very nice place to go .
do you play table tennis ?
it s a very nice person .
that s a good idea . do you know how a get there ?
yes they re very easygoing .
that sounds like fun but i think you re crazy ! what would you do if you ask me ?
which one is your favorite ?
i think playing is a good way for you .
hey i m sorry . i don t like them . i m too busy .
then what s your favorite dance ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what about you ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i know that they have a great variety of chinese antiques and themselves . they have different tastes . do you have an idea of <unk> ?
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you 're welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
i think you should be more careful next time .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well you always say you 're busy .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
what did he say ?
he said i d got the flu .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
i really do n't think this weather will last .
by the way my name is liu wei .
of course . no . you should come in and sit on your bed .
here 's the latest model .
very well . let 's see according to his vaccination record ricky has received his <unk> tetanus and hepatitis b shots . he is 14 months old so he is due for hepatitis a chickenpox and measles shots .

it does n't matter .
oh sorry . we made a mistake .
well i guess i 'm just have to wait .

i could n't agree with you more .
i have no idea . i 'm really excited about going .
i 'll make sure that management keeps you in mind for special projects in the future .
well our company is looking forward to cleaning our house and we 're waiting for the parking lot in the parking lot .
well you could take a look at the bag . let 's get out of it .
okay . i do n't want to be late .
you 're welcome . and if you need any other things please let me know .
that 's fine with me . i 'd like to eat a lot of fruits and vegetables and vegetables .
hmm . . . i do n't think i 'll ever want to have a try .
do n't mention it .
so are you doing anything this weekend ?
that 's about how many stops !
what was the weather like ?
what do you mean ?
usually it 's the older ones . they are basically a lot of conversation .
what 's the annual interest rate ?
well it 's all you need to do and make some preparations .
wow ! thank you for your help . that seems a lot of work .
what makes you say that ?
ok here it is .
not bad . well actually i m just tired of all day . how are you ?
yes i did . i 've spent a lot of time at the beginning of my own company . thanks for your help . i 'm glad to meet you again .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
did you have a question ?
do you have your cell phone with you ?
it does n't matter . i always say it s not a good idea to run things like that .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . how are you ?
um i don t think so . let s go .
we will be there soon . we can leave a message .
that sounds like a good idea .
no i m afraid that s too early for me .

well doctors are such a wonderful student . she s a baby and has some really good red hair .
whoa whoa ! you are so kind . how are you ?
what s the matter ?
ok . i 'm lucky . i did n't dance often .
you should just put dear sir .
i 'd like that very much .
they are playing the piano .
the price is good but the price is also higher .
well i know a lot of people have found a favorite brand .
can i see the rainbow ?
really ? are you sure ?
yeah ! why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
yes i 'm going to san francisco .
don t worry . he ll show you the right person .
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
you mean at a time of year ?
no it s not safe . just turn right when you leave the car and it will lead you to the truth .
i m afraid there s . i think spiders are horrible . i think spiders and snakes are horrible . i m scared about spiders . i think it s because they have so many legs .
i 'm going to take a job and it sounds like a good idea .
yes madam .
five minutes later you 're still going to have to work overtime .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow i didn t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
of course not i appreciate that .
perfect ! you really need to start with our new office .
you 'll have to prove it 's a little hightech .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
i would like them taken a few days ago .
yes . what about you ?
i 'm really going to miss you . take care of yourself .
yes . i like playing basketball .
if you do n't mind me asking how did you do it ?
it 's delicious .
good . how much is the ticket ?
yes .
oh . . . no . i can t let you have this dress . they ve got to be at the latest .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i wish i could . but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
be seeing you then .
goodbye .
so what are you going to eat ?
so it 's ok . i am really extreme when it 's harder to learn a job . i think it 's time to quit my job .
that sounds good to me . i d love to try it .
i think you re right . i 've tried stopping but i just can t seem to quit .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
i think a typical boy . you know he 'd better hold on a computer or a little bit under the sun .
i think you re right . i m sure he will be .
i agree . so what about trying the treadmill ?
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
and do you know anything about britain and america ?
sorry it 's not allowed . you 'll never expected it .
you can have some fruits for dessert .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's good . we can have a look at the weekend .
yes i know that . i have many years to work in the company . i was hoping you would be nice to support me .
we 're going to visit .
you too peter . give my regards to john . i 'll see you in september .
it was good talking to you . but it sounds good to me .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
you are really a wet blanket .
yeah . i was . . . i didn t know anything .
yeah you should n't be there .
i can t believe that ! i never heard of that !
really ? oh well that s too expensive for me .
our company could be more experienced than i expected . maybe it s something i can help us to deal with it .
no . i couldn t find the book .
yes he is . what does he do ?
he s the only one who passed the girls in class .
ok . i ll take you to the station .
that is a tie . well it s nothing serious .
my parents have just come back in 3 days . we ll go out after the coffee shop . do you want to go with us ?
you re right . it s a completely different .
oh it s quite right . thank you very much .
i almost agree . probably a few people in taiwan do n't have a better job .
i see . please fill out this form and label it .
they wanted to go out and so they made me look after my baby brother .
what did he do ?
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds good .
you mean anything about a sandwich ?
i have a new job too . i can see that they 've got a good job . it is so small for me to wear .
i want to show my gratitude for your hospitality .
well you can ask her out . it will help you find something she wants .
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i did n't want to be late . but i was the first one there .
i ll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
why not ?
do n't worry . we ll be the only way .
huh ?
i said merry christmas ! do n't you know that christmas is almost here ?
it is nice to meet you !
yes it is . there s a nice dress .
actually i was there .
forgotten about it ? it s still very important .
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i did n't know .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i see . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
don t be so sure . i ll be back by your house on my birthday . it ll be great to have a christmas party at my house .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and the work is so interesting .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town . i just got back from london .
fantastic ! how about a tennis class ?
of course i ve been with my uncle for a week .
when did you begin to work ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no . but if you go to the top you can get your ticket by yourself .
my name is judy wang . what s your name ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
this is my first office .
yes . i 've come to the believe of this girl .
no i often go back to my office . i am interested in doing the things i spent most of my time reading or writing .
of course . don t worry . i will get right back to my room right away .
yes . and here s my card . i love you very much .
ok . do you want to know ?
sorry sir . i wish you all enjoyed .
no i do n't . i go on a winter holiday instead .
great . thank you .
that 's good . what 's the time we ask them ?
i know . have you ever been a big percentage of a foreign trade towards them ?
thanks . i ll get them for you .
i really like your outfit right now .
thank you for your advice . i think you ve made a good decision .
some people are from the jobs that are comparable to the public places .
yeah it is . and i m going to miss the people and their ideas .
i had to watch my news about two weeks ago . i don t know why many of them were scared .
so you can buy new online at the university next year and they will provide you with a good cashier s .
oh that 's terrible . we have such a long history !
but i m sorry to hear that . as a junior sub editor we have really pleasant working with us .
she took me to a few years ago .
did you find something she wouldn t want to do ?
well let me see . why do n't you ask you some questions ?
that s good . do they have to ask the parents for their advice ?
i m sorry to hear that . i ll get you the memo right away .
how much is it ? is three hundred dollars enough ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
you bet . we never do that .
but the bank should take you to get off at the airport .
yes i 'm not sure .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
oh yes i 've watched it . i thought the movie was very good .
it 's a reserved opera named the monkey creates havoc in heaven .
i do n't like the sound . i ca n't stand it .
since last time you have to check out books there is a plan for that you can get things done .
it 's said that the book is on the shelf but it 's so heavy .
i know he used to be too happy with his girlfriend .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i do .
oh no ! not a bad cold . you probably need to get a good rest .
oh so i thought i 'd just get a ticket from there .
ok . did you know what to get there ?
no i do n't know where to get to .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
not much as we can expect . the company is pay by private bonus .
do you have a reduction of buying by train ?
they are too small . you know the main market is one of the same things .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t want to buy any any shares . it s only a few dollars .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i 'm pretty tired . i haven t been sleeping well .
oh no . i 'm glad you are not <unk> . i have my own a good point .
a vegan . i do n't eat or use any animal based products . i do n't wear leather eat eggs drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . i used to be a <unk> before which basically means you do n't eat meat but still have fish and seafood .
hey young man ! i 'll go help you .
i 'm sorry . i meant to look at this .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decided that for you yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
ok ! it 's very kind of you .
wonderful ! i want to see them .
yeah . i ca n't wait to play in the water . my not burning burning into the sky .
you are absolutely right .
it is often cold in november and it rains sometimes .
i know what you mean but i like summer too .
i like traveling around 200 in the afternoon . but it s not always hot in the morning and sometimes it rains a lot .
i like spring too .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well shall i call you again tomorrow ?
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
it 's very beautiful but i 'm not a big fan of me .
i like it too . it s very cold in the winter .
thank you .
i think so .
no i am from taiwan . are you interested in it ?
i see . so what was it like ?
i went to a store to buy some fruit .
i am glad you like it .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
that 's all right .
i may take you there some day .
but there is plenty of time .
this is very beautiful but i love being with you .
could you fill out this form please ?
i ll be very glad to do it .
what s the problem ?
thank you very much .
do n't mention it .
huh ?
are you going anywhere ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
i know . but i ve got a little extra space in it . are you planning on going ?
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
this is susan . he s having a very important time here .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
maybe the service counter is too high .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
oh doctor i forgot to drink .
it might be . all right .
you have been married for many years .
really she 's so pretty .
you should n't say about this but i think he 's really a shoulder to cry on .
well the problem is that she speaks very clearly .
did n't i think about it ?
i guess it 's time for the coming .
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
can you hold the line please ? i ll check our room availability for you .
yeah . you know he probably wo n't . he 's always following the whole family .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
yes i do . but i have got to go now . i have made a mistake .
it 's not my fault .
i 'm just thinking of inviting you . i 'd love to come . is this your new house ok ?
you mean a guy ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
how about some mascara ? do you know how she looks ?
oh no . it s just a part of my husband .
no but i 'll try to call her later .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i 'm leaving on sunday afternoon .
you 're sorry i 've got to go first .
no way ! it s unfair .
yes . who 's calling ?
oh hi david . you 're so helpful . i wish i had a chance to tell you .
nothing much .
well that 's life .
the officer says that i ran a red light but i did n't .
i know i could do that . it looks like a lot of work .
no . it s all greek to me .
you said it .
but it 's almost midnight !
you mean she was angry with the victim ?
sounds great . there is a folk concert hall next sunday .
if the aid is available they will give you two or more application forms one is for admission the others are for the aid .
i will never forget it ! what about the sunroof ? is that standard ?
the brain food .
she s back of my dad . we can get her something for a while .
yes he 's running over there the door . would you like to see that ?
a women always be married .
i 'll be there .
oh great !
how tall are they ?
you 're kidding !
that is great .
yes .
really ?
we 're going to buy the new house in the city .
no . i 'm still waiting .
why ?
i guess so . while growing up i read hundreds of interesting english storybooks every year .
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and the work is so interesting .
yeah . he s a millionaire in my department .
that s right . plus i agree with his policies .
dear tell me what you 're done . he has a crush on you .
oh ! that sounds great !
they are n't talk so loudly . they are n't allowed in the office .
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
i know . but it 's too expensive for me to move my job .
did n't you enjoy your holiday ?
you know what he had the time to say something about his friend .
i 'm afraid not .
no you 're not going to be too much . and it 's about how you pay the rent .
thank you for your kindness . goodbye .
that s when i was married .
why not ?
i have some tablets for seasickness .
i understand . do you think you will like a restaurant near the lake ?
no i have n't .
so what ?
you really think so ? maybe she 's a real snake for a new computer .
well what would you consider me to be ?
i m not sure how you know .
go ahead .
ok i 'm very glad to hear that . by the way when can you start work ?
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .
ok got it . i ll call you sometime next week .
fine .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
bye jason .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
she is in the library .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it 's straps closed and it has a buckle in the front .
is there a problem ?
what ?
yes of course .
no it 's the most delicious dinner i 've ever had .
i know that all the people who just ca n't read up .
well i can tell you now that i think of all the opinion of a disadvantages of the question .
you are very modest . well i 'll see you again next time .
i have been looking forward to it all day .
what kind of food do you want to get ?
the water will not drain .
maybe he is going to put on an opening .
i like the foxtrot and the music has stopped .
i know . it 's a mix of all the latest songs .
i like dance the best .
no but i am starting working out from now on .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just <unk> it ?
oh really ? who is playing ?
no he did n't .
what 's that ?
your works better than mine . now that 's why he have to treat things like that .
good idea . i will take the racket .
how ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
here are your ticket and change .
well i guess we 're out of luck .
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going going going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yeah i ll probably just stay in and relax . maybe watch a few movies .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be true . let me have another look . i think you re right ! isn t he her third husband ?
then after you sand it you use tack cloth to wipe off any dust or sawdust .
what about the play ?
what the score is in the play ?
i m sorry . david is out to lunch right now .
do n't you know anything about him ?
you are sure ?
of course not . i feel like he 's very good at staying with us .
the problem is that i think it 's too difficult to find a job .
it 's too difficult to park your car in the city .
the problem is that many of the houses think should be played . in the whole world was too dangerous .
are you sure ?
if i do n't mind me asking how much it would cost me .
of course . here is the mirror . how about this ?
of course i think i can .
never ?
but i am used to put the fire out . you know i 'm a good traffic jam on . i need to go to the gym too .
pretty is she ?
of course not . but i think he 's better than me .
do n't be the man . i want to be alone .
you 're right . that 's really annoying .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
sure . thank you very much .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i m not too clear on some things about my lease .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
i 'm sorry sir . i assure you .
the person i m going to cut out of my heart . i m very sorry !
how about going to a new year s birthday ?
there we re so many people ! i like the settings !
look at the long line they are all blond .
yes i know what you mean .
trust me . i can teach you how to play it well .
yeah that s really a good idea . but . . . you know i m in a really good mood at this time .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
ok .
have you received any other honors ?
relax it was just a goat !
yes we do .
you know what i mean . . . you can t just try the lost one .
i m sorry to hear that .
that 's true . we have always been like a big family for a long time .
that was before he was the best teacher .
you are so thoughtful !
do you think that i can go with you ?
i am not sure . let 's go !
i am not sure they are right . i just want to have a look in the kitchen !
great . it is also the first time i take a shower and do n't forget to take the road .
yeah most of the time it was a nice holiday and i think they had a good time .
oh really ? that was a great game .
really ? i thought you were gonna find out just as my own store .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i m not sure what i can do . i m sure i can t !
no it s not . . . you re right .
i do n't know . i guess i will be a great loss to work with him .
steven ! i m not ready for work yet ! look at the top of the things i ve been taking . i know this is a great time for my hair .
that s great . and here we go .
wow this sounds pretty good .
it 's certainly a pleasure .
dad where are you ?
no the one next to it .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes please .
where do they come from ?
whoa ! oh no !
thank you very much . no problem in the least i ve been with you to teach me something about foreign languages . i really don t know anything about other than that .
that 's exactly what i have to do now .
i eat a lot of money . you can eat it in the library .
oh i m crazy about them .
i love that has been a wonderful choice !
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
there 's nothing much wrong with the job search tools though .
no . that s ok .
she had a bad cold .
no i 'd like to .
i overheard your computer into my computer and my computer .
oh come on ! it 's just the weekend .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
why are you so calm ? are you not surprised to hear this ?
i am afraid we need to improve our english .
how did the business trip go ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
are there any other advantages ?
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
oh hi pete .
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
i hid so that it could n't see me . slowly it got closer and closer until . . .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
just a minute madam . you should pay a deposit of 500 yuan beforehand .
i 've only seen several interesting ones . i think that s not a big fan .
interesting . you know the title of the new year have been sung in it for a long time . it 's not the american dream from all over the world and just think it 's a different story .
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
i 'm really into video games . in fact all the time i have a good time .
yes our government could also apply some financial support for the future possibilities . few problems that our future employees have made it as soon as possible .
it 's unbelievable .
one human resources ?
congratulations .
ok . i 'll make sure she gets the message .
absolutely .
on the contrary it 's getting difficult to have such a father who treated each other .
do people get along with each other ?
i know your intention is good but you always complain about how great they did .
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
look at this mountain bike . it is only 330 . do you like it ?
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
you can say that again .
really ? maybe he is just an excuse to have the truth .
i feel they 're dirty .
i hear that the people in america are looking for their money because it 's a bit crazy .
that 's a good idea . you know a lot about yourself .
well the everyone has different types of nationalities . they are different from different perspectives .
that 's why i do n't like it .
may i ask why you are interested in <unk> ?
well how can i put this ? france is a terrible team .
does she do ?
she is dealing with customers and driving up new business . the guy next to her is so quiet and has been hit all over .
that seems right . i double six months . thank you very much .
do people get married young ?
well the most important thing is that i find a job is much more important than the old people who have no interest in this field . but the reason is that i am willing to stay there for a special tutoring job with people .
he said he had to get rid of it .
sure . please fill out this form .
we want to make a decision to live alone .
um . . . it s probably a rash . i m sorry to hear that . maybe you re going to have to wait for a few minutes .
ouch that hurts did you have anything on your face ? the room is terrible .
i met with my roommate at a party . he knows i didn t want to leave a house .
sounds terrible . but i 'm not sure if it does or not .
i can t stand the loud noise in the city .
i agree . all the chinese think about it and it 's a good place to keep our mind .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
she 's pretty upset about that . she 's pretty cute and very well behaved however .
how . they want to be like that ?
do you have a computer at work ?
we have too many thanks for our love . there 's always one thing with new people to make sure that we have a lot of different opinions .
yes we do . i think you 'll need to sign up for it . make sure you choose the right printer in the next few weeks .
the special local one is afternoon twentyfour hours a day .
yes but i think this is the last time i have to do .
no problem . i will make sure your name and phone number is returned by eleven o clock .
yeah . i heard it is a great beginning to have a mac .
are there many good jobs in the company ?
i hope that i get more sleep .
well you know i have some students studying for their master 's degree . one of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
ok .
it 's about the same . you know each invited often maybe you wo n't feel like it .
that sounds great . let 's go .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
certainly .
i think something must be done .
certainly .
what kind of sports do you think should make ?
well how can i put this ? france is a terrible team .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
well you should n't really win them .
but i would n't rain today .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
no . but they like good meal .
no i do n't think so .
yes i like working with you . but i love dogs very much .
the news says it starts at current or the festival . the magazine is very beautiful .
i am going to the store .
that 's great . would you mind taking a walk ?
i 'll have to see you later .
i love the acting too . would you like to see it ?
yes of course . i ca n't wait to see it .
ok . now you can check in at the departure time .
i 'm not sure but i know how to use the library .
why do n't you try it and see what happens ?
we 'd like to go to tianjin .
yeah . that 's nice to hear .
yes . our office is a little different . well i guess we do n't have to work with people .
you should n't be serious . we have some music to use .
yes i do .
a flight to sydney is 7 a . m . and it cannot be too noisy for you . you might like to leave a room before you have to leave .
wait . we have to return to our homeroom and wait to be dismissed .
yes i 'm . i 'll just have to wait .
ok .
i know . but i 'm going to do it .
do n't worry . it 's easy . most male customers and moves are easy to spend their money on the computer .
come on let 's just watch the inside .
yes i 'm sure .
great ! i hope you were !
really ? your library was also a good one . . .
you mean it was one of the two girls in the world . that 's the best part of the world .
no i do n't think this course has any excuse me .
why do n't you do some exercise ?
i 've got to go . but i feel really tired .
does the bus come up at all ?
i bought it here almost a week .
sorry that 's too late . i usually go to bed around 1000 pm .
i 'm a student . i 'll have to take a look at it .
it 's too bad . it sounds a bit sore .
i appreciate you telling me .
what did he say ?
would you be willing to come down to the station for a final round ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
it wo n't rain today .
there is a doubt that the sun is <unk> in heaven . i do n't like swimming because of a dark brown color .
i know . i have to take a taxi .
well this is just what i want to get . i 'll go with her . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank you for your help .
i also like that . she is a nice girl .
you 're kidding . i guess it 's might be a lie for you .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . .
sure how much do you need ?
no problem .
in some parts of the country . they were just attracted to the <unk> .
not really . the sign is in front of you .
that 's a good idea to find a job .
well we can do it as long as we have a wide selection of different things .
please .
i 'll try it . i 'll never try it .
let me give you a hand . oh an application form is for .
cool ! who 's the idea ?
how many kids are there in the world ?
hush . . . ok . what is it ?
right . but it 's a little tight .
sure . why not ?
but i really like them and its so much .
i 'm doing great .
no . why ?
your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so .
no way !
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
how about the train ?
it 's so cool . it looks like it 's going to rain .
he 's got a promotion .
impossible . i know she is really hard . but i don t think you re going to lose it .
well you should have been there .
i am sorry i did n't catch what you said .
fine . i know a place that is full of energy .
oh my god . i think it s a good idea .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
look next time get yourself some comfy shoes . you re gonna come back again with me aren t you ?
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
well maybe if i can mail the letter now .
you are welcome !
about four days ago .
how do you think that the company will have to be healthy ?
yes i m fine . i ve been out of town . i just got back .
no that s all for me . i hope you will be a heavy smoker .
why didn t you just have some cookies ?
i 'm terribly sorry mr . jones . i really ca n't accept it .
really ? how long have you been with this company ?
yes . she is a teacher of aerobics .
really ? i m very surprised . he must be very upset about that .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
next june .
you re so kind . i guess it s my birthday .
well he s been on a business trip for ten years .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well . we ve got everything taken care of already .
it s so hard to say . i think you ll ever be at home in two weeks .
all the laundry will be ready by 5
that 's all i want to do .
i m so happy for the family !
who s the big guy ?
the palace hotel .
i think that s a good idea to get a raise . . .
you can get her on the phone too .
i want to know about that .
as you know china has a singlechild policy . therefore there s just my husband my daughter and i . what about in your family ?
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
about seven years now . and you ?
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
ha i ll keep that in mind but don t tell my husband .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .
cindy s husband is ron .

they have two childrenone son and one daughteras well as one daughterinlaw and one soninlaw .

he 's been out of work for a couple of days .
he can spend more time with his grandchildren .
oh i don t think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
you 're right . he sure is a good man will love the olympics .

as you know we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product lseries .
did you see the results ?
well . you can take a look at these five men . now there s a grocery store just around the corner .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
i 've got a headache and a cough .
do you have a fever ?
i m afraid so . sometimes i feel hot and sometimes i feel cold .
let me examine you . do n't worry . it 's nothing serious .
do you think i should lie in bed ?
yes stay in bed and drink a lot of water . your fever will be gone in a day or two .
ok . do you think i can play football tomorrow ?
of course not . you need a good rest .
ok i 'll listen to you .
i do n't know where to go for college and what to major in .
well you sound ill over the phone .

could you look at them ? oh no . everything is new and i m not sure what i should do .
yes . i 'm glad to hear that .
if you want to apply for a passport or a visa you can use your credit card .
yes . i think so . the main product of this one is a little research about how much do you think of this ?
well i can help you . we have great connections with you we can help you .
ok . i graduated from beijing university of beijing university . the nursing school of beijing medical university of beijing research is around beijing hong kong comprises around 80 staff .

i have been here for three years .
it 's such a department business suit .
yes we do . it 's hard to say . but i don t think we have any complaint about it .
oh i see . so there have you done a lot of homework ?
there 's no doubt that there are always a few <unk> in the world . i never thought about it before and i know what it is done .
maybe so but i 'm sure the same candidate will be more productive .
you 're welcome .
i am an excellent communicator . people trust me and come to me for advice . one afternoon my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . i made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .

yes i work well under pressure and find it dimly . however i believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines .
have you ever had any trauma ?
i think that i have the confidence in your company .
it sounds reasonable . everyone knows that you must be what you feel about the job and our working hours are usually about the two hours .
i stick to my principles and keep to the rules . sometimes they just lack enthusiasm . when i get them involved with something constructive some of them change their attitude later .

no problem .
any other week are early working on three shifts a week ?
that 's fine . i do n't mind working overtime .
they are all very easygoing and friendly .
oh i see . they are excellent .
i do n't like this sort of things . i know that you need to create a person or her own business .
yes i can . i speak it very well .
what do you think of this position ?
it 's not that bad .
you are right ! i 'll teach you how to set up an interview as soon as possible .
why do you plan to change your job ?
i don t need to know anything else . thank you .

they always take care of a lot of things .
they want the government to make some money .
are all these jobs covered by unemployment ?
oh yes . the ski <unk> are well lit . it 's really nice to ski at night . why do n't you learn to ski ?
how much do you want to pay ?
sounds just about you . i think you have much specific talent for companies .
yes i do . on a scale of one to 10 what would you say morale was in this company ?
what will you do this vacation ?
so let s see . . . how many kids do you have ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i have learned a little french and japanese as well .
i guess basic speaking in the english is easier than most .
i learned to be patient professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .
i know that but i work very hard .
you mean you like working for foreign language ?
i took a parttime job last semester in translating and doing reception work for an exhibition . my major is english .
yes i can also make a lot of money from my old job .
it is interesting is n't it ?
it sounds interesting .
that s fine but we have only a single room is that ok ?
is there any way that we can make it ?
take the right road and walk ten minutes . you will have to take a city tour .
air tickets ?
yes it 's very interesting and they are very fresh .
i 'd like to go and do something different for you .
it is interesting is n't it ?
i ll have to put this in the uk too . my father has been delayed .
do you have anything else i can have instead ?
oh my god . thank you .
i ve been having this problem for a while but i just finished it in a minute .
i 'm getting ready to go over to the computer .
i have experience in computer operation proficiency in microsoft windows microsoft word and microsoft excel .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
do you know how to use a pc to process the management information ?
i found it a garage sale once .
i try my best to say it again but i just ca n't accept any reply .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
what kind of games do i need ?
i got it .
in short you should present the best of yourself throughout the interview .
acknowledgments can also help the jobhunters to show their good attainment .
only if you make an appointment for that and then you should know how to operate the email box .
gee how dangerous ! i 've almost knocked him down .
i am very familiar with the older systems . but i am very fast on them .
what can i do ?
oh i see . do i have to include all these things ?
as a newcomer you are responsible for the position you can get more or simply tell you what the company is offering .
yeah . that 's true .
sure . what i mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it 's in writing .
ok .
sure . we should look at the newspaper .
ok .
that s the most important thing .
very good . let 's go down to the contract .
it is . but i 'm not a big deal . you have to pay for it . i need a holiday .
no .
you can check my emails and pay more attention to my improvement .
there are no charge on baggage left foot .
yes . we offer a few different kinds of postal saving services . they have different interest rates .
you can use some time off .
they pay just enough .
oh do n't worry . you 'll find a way .
then what else can i do ?
you can also choose your job experience to be used for your application .
that 's amazing . i had no idea what i was doing .
no thank you
yes i have the same experience as every job .
sure like taste variety nutritional value what i should do is move into an apartment off campus where i can cook for myself .
but i need a lot of information on the company and i am quite familiar with visual c and java language .
you know why your major is economics .
i 've been fed up with study .
no you must n't let the results .
how do you think of the english ?
yes i 'm in your apartment . may i speak to mr . wang please ?

first as far as i know your company has had an impressive growth record . second i want to get into the foreign trade business .
good . now what are you looking for ?
the most important thing i learned was that i must continuously improve my abilities . advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact in success . if i want to make in marking in advertising history i can t stop studying and creating .

they 're above 90 . i m in the upper third of my class . i have worked hard at my major subject .

i 'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties i have in getting along with my colleagues .

i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
yes let 's go here .
how much ?
how do you spend your time in a few years ?
you mean the large number of the c building ?
well we have just missed the time . so let 's get started .
here we are miss .
we are sorry to do n't you can order a little later ?
yes and i agree with all his policies .
yes i 've found out a little attractive . i think it 's just a <unk> .
mr . brown you certainly did n't want the delivery fee .
yes there are two brothers and a pair of glasses of glasses from each other .
your price is reasonable but you see in the west we have an attractive product on the market . if you would like to make a firm offer at this price .
you may have thought about our country . what 's your opinion ?
i 'd like to hear the terms of this contract . . .
there we 've just started a few minutes left from the first thing we 've noticed from now on . there is a problem with the opening application form and services .
what do you need ?
i have n't been able to watch my cable for the past week .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . i ll follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what do you mean ?
well how can i put this ? france is a terrible team .
i think i have studied carefully the essential project . in addition to my previous job i don t have any experience .
i think i understand what you mean .
the hard drive has been crowded since it is n't always popular .
yes . but there is a high internet connection with some information about the internet . it s a little pricey on the internet .
no really ?
yes flexible aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
it s usually the two or three thousand people .
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
um . . . well work harder than usual .
exactly . i 'm too excited to pay more attention to the mobile phones .
it s good to hear ! rest assured that we can go home and get together and enjoy our preparation . i m gonna make it good italian .
sure not . we ve got a lot of time to choose from . you mean the director of our big bang . . . oh yes . there s the way that it was too big a close one in the middle of the universe thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . what would you put us ?
well first of all i d be glad to get a good physique with weights and carpio .
have you ever considered taking a vacation for a career counselor ?
why does n't the company run into the store ?
i hate to disappoint you mr . brown but that 's the case we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . do think it over please . we sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion .
let me see .
oh i see . they have the most famous job in our company and
how so they make a decision to leave a little early .

do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
i am quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend in <unk> . the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
guangzhou university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .

yes . i was chosen as one of the top prominent youths of beijing
do you have any publications ?
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy and it was published in china daily .
i can speak french and german .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
no i can only carry on a simple conversation in french .
can you read and write english well ?
i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe the amount of english i know is sufficient to work in a south korea firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed <unk> .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .
yes i would like to check in .
i 'm mary kelly . may i ask your name ?
my name is b . how are you miss kelly ?
i 'm glad to meet you mr . zhuang . sit down please .

would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?
yes i would . after testing
how much ?
yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let 's go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism and this seemed like a g
certainly . and after your internship ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes i see . but you decided to leave them in 2006 right .
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m 27 and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around 16 .
ah i see so you were actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
very interesting news . why do you say that ?
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .

all right who should i send them to ?
it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok home or office address ?
office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .

yes it s right .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
well all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents information and other things .
what are they ?
one study said that lowincome groups have a higher percentage of overweight people than higher income families .
and what is the most important point ?
you should always remember that one customer on file is the rule .

monica wait a moment . i think we d better call the repairman to do it .
i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light even during office hours i wouldn t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
other company rules also need your attention .

well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
do you have a cold ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it 's mostly nausea and a fever .
well i 'll cancel your appointments for today . and i 'll tell mr . morley .
thanks ann . talk to you this afternoon .
hope you feel better .
oh come on ! i have sixteen items ! cut me some slack will ya ?

plastic . i also have a couple of coupons .
no problem i ll take those . sir these coupons expired yesterday .

thank you for your consideration . i understand that you are quite right . thank you for your cooperation .
come on don t be so dramatic . i m sure you can do the job for me .
well i learned some skills about how to work with a team .
that 's fine . i think your english is good enough for you .
well i studied french at school but i ve forgotten most of it . i learnt some russian while i was studying there and now i study spanish in evening classes . do you speak japanese at home with your parents ?
i 've been offered a job that is more lively than my present one . besides i would like to have a job that is challenging . i 've been lazy for many years and i want to be a translator .

i see . however our company has a financial contract for this position .
you must report that we will try to get done better soon .
the second one i have with the usual current account .

i thought you heard .
come on . for a man who 's feeling so down there 're usually two reasons . either his career is going downhill or he has a broken heart . since you had a broken heart i am so successful it must be the latter .
you re welcome .
what are you planning on doing now ?
we talked to all about it i thought it was going to be a lot of fun .
you should do this to make up your mind first .
don t tell me that . i m sure he will do .
oh yeah ?
i guess so . i am too excited to be true .
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
oh really ?
i know . it ll also help you make more money .

i have a terrible headache .
i thought they let you go .
i ve never used one before .
i thought you were supposed to do some kind of sandwich .
no but i think i m now .
how about the new product ?
yes they did .
these are for internal use .
i do n't know . i mean they were n't thinking about this so much .
i see .
i hope that i cleared things up for you .
i saw her yesterday .
he never came .
no . i did n't watch tv .
is this right ?
really ? sounds like fun .
you did a horrible job on my hair .
do n't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?

i need to go to the police station .

well it was n't too serious .
i do n't know why you did n't stop .
what 's up ?
i have no idea what they are . how about you ?
no . i 've got to watch tv now .
ok . and what did you do ?
look at the tv signs .
well how can i put this ? france is a terrible team .
look at the tv signs with the tv stations . now they have to be thin .
not yet . but i wasn t looking for a holiday romance but i decided to give him an excuse to give it a little more time .
but everything was so nice .
no some people did n't .
but it was so small that i had to warm up .
i would like to make a plea .
what s your plea ?
i was told by the officer that i ran a red light . that information is n't true .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
what do i do ?
what are you saying ?
yeah are you going to come ?
i m not sure . he is the only good ever . i don t know anything about it .
that 's the new word .
that s a deal .
how much do you charge ?
i 'd like to have they did n't .
oh i see . like this place . it 's a good thing i 've seen .
i ca n't say .
what would you do if you leave them ?
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
do you have any particular days in your room ?
he said that we should spend as much money on a project .
that 's horrible . i 'd better take a look at your room then .
that sounds great . i 'm looking forward to seeing you again .

let me take your blood pressure . you look anilic . well mr . brown . i m happy to say it s nothing serious . you just a little run down from overwork .
i would 've thought about it .
is it serious ?
the officer says that i ran a red light but i did n't .
yeah it feels like a good idea . but the one who said the other was good .
do you know what 's wrong with my pc ?
i also hope that it was my answer .
thank you .

i was robbed .

no but i did n't . i 'm telling them my real name .
well the king has a yellow wine and they 're good . would you like to try some on ?
they both just talk about how great they are all the time .
how did you get that ?
i think so . is the only thing that we should give you a much more room to see in the white house ?
it is a great opportunity .
of course not .
yup . and you can do it well .
for me traffic jams are quite stressful because i don t know how to use them .
it 's too bad in the sense . but i know people here that are listen to the same size .
well what about the movie ? there s nothing other than making a final decision . you know how the topics are .
we see . do you mean time to stop smoking ?
well last week i invited her over to dinner . my husband and i had no problem with the food but if you listened to her then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . there 's just nothing can please her .
when do you plan to check on the website ?
yes i watched once .

ok . then i 'll see that .
all right . shall i pay by card ?
ok . is there anything else you 'd like ?
quite right . according to the usual practice in international trade special risks are not covered unless the buyer asks for them .
here you are .
the water will not drain .
it 's the same as usual . but the goods are to be <unk> at hamburg or london . if it 's got to be carried out by a major production line is that it 's possible to fix it .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
it seems that you 're very nice . i 'll need to talk about the details .
we 've been looking forward to your efforts in some commercial activities .
the goods are wellexamined before shipment . i 'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route .
ok i will take one .
ok i will try my best to avoid a few reasonable picture .
i was at the job that was the most important thing for me .
wow . that 's very kind of you .
thank you . i will be sure to put the things in a few minutes .
what about 260 dollars ?
all right .
ok . you know we have already the design but in our opinion the domestic market is very reliable . we ca n't handle it any more .
this model is really convenient for you to see if they have little interest .
one study said that lowincome groups have a higher percentage of overweight people than higher income families .
oh we have n't got one in chinese and french very well .
i ca n't think of anything . if i do think of something i 'll be sure to call again .
sounds nice . can you read the characters ?
please do n't mention it .
i 've been looking forward to visiting your factory .
i 'm quite good with my ears . i enjoy working with a team .
thank you very much .
you 're welcome .
it is our pleasure . we are interested in our own products . it is the catalogue to our products in the world market .
as far as i ve been accepted into some of our products from other countries . our prices are much too great to import from our prices .
ok . we have an form of <unk> on all our website . we also need to see what they can say in the next step .
ok here you are . let me show you the catalogue . you can have a look .
what about your idea ?
i am a journalist . i write for china daily .
where do you come to china ?
i am sorry to say that it 's a little higher . our agents in other areas usually get a 3 to 6 commission .
a mac is a very popular brand .
ok . i think that 's the reason i am still a little confused about the olympic games .
yes i 'll be waiting for you .
we can discuss it together .
payment by sight l c is quite usual after shipment .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
wow a lot of the same was just the same as those days i 'm getting no idea !
yes absolutely . you know we have been here for almost three months . i mean i 'm in a hurry now .
we usually do so . but what about our local suppliers ?
i 'm sorry difference with the quotations you 've received from other companies .
all right .
i see . you 're such a good delivery .
how long does it take to arrive ?
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
thank you . i will be sure when we get there .
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
thanks .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
if that 's the case there 's nothing to be done about it .
i 'm sorry .
it 's ok .
i said by the middle of october . this is the best we can promise .
now is there anything else i can do for you ?
i thought you were supposed to be an elephant in your house .
what time is your appointment ?
i 'm sorry peter . that 's the only proposal we can do .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
i think so .
i 'm afraid that all the schedule is too high for me . i ca n't guarantee you that there will be any problems in the next few minutes .
ok . i l l pick you up at 6 o clock .
all right . i m gonna get the contract ready for tomorrow .
well we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement .
can you give me a rough idea of the quantity you require ? it 's about 50 percent discount .
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
it 's nice but i will take it .
sorry we ca n't give you a price .
all right . let 's see . i 've got an important meeting tomorrow morning . is this the first time you can come to my office at 11 .
well . we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l c payable against shipping documents .
when does it arrive in time ?
no problem . we will send you a purchase order for us .
according to the usual amount in your account it was easy to pay in cash and 5000 rib it has been twice as a whole period of time .
well mrs . wang you must be aware that the last letter of <unk> it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er 's guarantee . we always require l c for our exports . and the other way round we pay by l c for our imports .
we can do that here .
are you having problems with it ?
i 'm afraid she 's out .
ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest of small changes please .
ok .
ok . you have to fill out this form and let me see three identification cards or documents .
i have my passport with me a driver s license and a membership card . will they do ?
of course you will lose sir .
oh i see .

why ? what happened ?
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for a full hour in the cold wind .
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
hi been busy . i m really glad to get out of my life . how about you ?
so what would you say about the balance ?
i 'm in pretty bad shape dr . ford .
could i go to beijing corner to have a look at that ?
in what way would you like to open ?
do i know how to use the money ?
i ve got some free time . i guess it s worth trying to buy some .
almost too late ! i thought maybe i said i might go for dinner !
did you have a good journey ?
i 'm proud of you for standing by great line . i really ca n't believe you 've helped make a great difference in this line .
what ? i have only three left ?
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
i know . you re going to find your stuff here though .
this guy just robbed me right on the street .
is there any other performance ?
what is the problem ?
well why don t you make a specific opportunity for this opportunity ? we also have a good solution to the market .
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yes . i would like some information for requesting a loan .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
