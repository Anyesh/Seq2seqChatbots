not the hacking and gagging and spitting part .   please . 
okay .  .  .  then how bout we try out some french cuisine .   saturday ?   night ? 
that 's a shame . 
let me see what i can do . 
i do n't want to know how to say that though .   i want to know useful things .  like where the good stores are .   how much does champagne cost ?   stuff like chat .   i have never in my life had to point out my head to someone . 
okay  you 're gonna need to learn how to lie . 
bogey lowenstein's party is normal but you 're too busy listening to bitches who need prozac to know that . 
in 9th .   for a month
now i do .   back then was a different story . 
no .  you did n't !   if you really thought i could make my own decisions you would 've let me go out with him instead of helping daddy hold me hostage . 
god you 're just like him !  just keep me locked away in the dark so i ca n't experience anything for myself
no !  you 're not dating until your sister starts dating .   end of discussion . 
but it 's not fair  she 's a mutant daddy ! 
and where 're you going ? 
it 's just a party .  daddy but i knew you 'd forbid me to go since gloria steinem over there is n't going 
fine .   i see that i 'm a prisoner in my own house .   i 'm not a daughter .  i 'm a possession ! 
i have a date daddy .   and he s not a captain of oppression like some men we know . 
never
bianca stratford .   sophomore .  do n't even think about it
unlikely but even so she still ca n't go out with you .   so what 's the point ? 
he seems like he thrives on danger
fine thirty . 
are you lost ? 
william did n't even go to high school
i got drunk .   i puked .   i got rejected .  it was big fun . 
who ? 
oh honey  tell me we have n't' progressed to fullon hallucinations . 
and why would i do that ? 
i 'm getting trashed man .  is n't that what you 're supposed to do at a party ? 
i just need to lie down for awhile
you do n't strike me as the type that would ask permission . 
bianca
what are you doing here ? 
maybe . 
i figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect .   and piss you off . 
i do n't like to do what people expect .  then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change . 
fallacy . 
hearsay . 
no one else knows
so i have to have a motive to be with you ? 
then tell them i had a seizure . 
as a parent that 's my right
funny . 
which parts ? 
hi . 
whatever the hell it is you 're standin' there waitin' to say . 
your life and that of others ! 
if they agree to follow me yes . 
no .   the portuguese have already discovered blackskinned people .   i too will find other populations  and bring them to the word of god . 
naturally .   but i would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for spain for a .  .  .  dispute over a point of geography . 
indeed .   the world is full of mercenaries  and states often make use of them when it benefits them .   my only concern is the welfare and prosperity of spain . 
on the contrary your eminence .   it seems to me the man is preparing his own cross . 
i know . 
i can arrange for the queen to take fernando and diego into her service . 
not everything .  .  .  do you think i care ?   i 'm a free man again .   riches do n't make a man rich they only make him busier .  .  . 
may i ask by whom ? 
yes .  .  .  yes i do .  .  .  on all of them ! 
look out of that window . 
roofs .  .  .  towers palaces .  .  .  spires .  .  . 
chief says .  .  . 
esdras is a jew . 
new worlds create new people . 
you show no inclination to speak otherwise ! 
we do n't need to know . 
we came here to stay !   to build !  not to start a crusade .   in this forest there is enough danger to sweep us away in days !   so we will be brave and swallow our grief .   and in the name of those who died we will accomplish what we came for . 
can i see your back ? 
no . 
so you were never a prostitute ? 
i 'm just trying to find out who you are . 
i know . 
if you were my boyfriend i 'd suggest you find another girlfriend that is n't going to jail tenthousand miles away . 
go on . 
i 'm from a small town in slovakia .   like the south here .   the police is right a civilian is wrong .   so i fled . 
then why did n't you talk to the reporter ? 
what was that korfin ? 
maybe you could just put in a shot of martell ? 
when ? 
no . 
nah i musta missed it . 
look i 'm not even sure she has anything to do with this .   i saw her outside after the fire  thought it was a lead .  maybe she saw something .   maybe she was visiting somebody here .   who knows ? 
this is n't homicide school . 
better than one . 
hey !   i always wanted to be a cop when i was a kid .   i dreamed of running up to a door kicking it in pulling my gun and yelling freeze ! at the bad guy !  what 'd you dream about ? 
yeah . 
i do n't have a girlfriend . 
but i mean did n't you ever go out on a limb for somebody ?   i mean you shoulda heard her there .   tellin' her whole story .  .  . i believed her . 
how you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an immigration lawyer .   here here 's a number of an immigration lawyer .   that 's how you help her .  but you ca n't get involved in her like that .   you 're gonna jeopardize your career your life and you 're gonna jeopardize my case .   and lemme give you another piece of advice .   maybe you do n't watch tv but i 'll let you in on a little secret  the whole fuckin' world watches television .   and when you get out there they know your face .   and the little fame the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that i get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job .   and i get more done because of it . 
what do you want ? 
then do it asshole . 
is it drug related ? 
alright . 
okay . 
you did n't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues .   you could give me something . 
maybe i should just ya know .  .  . turn to the cameras and say do you mind if we just work something out ? 
alright alright eddie .   do n't patronize me . 
could be leon's . 
no .   tell me what you want to say . 
okay .   okay .   hold that thought just for a second .   they only call me when it 's an emergency .   just hold that thought .   can you call back ? 
okay .   and you know what i 'll swing by my place grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours .  .  . how 's that .  .  .  would that be a good thing . 
yes . 
is there a problem ? 
whatever we do  we fuck her right ? 
does it hurt ? 
and the whore 's murder ?   you did n't erase that either did you ?   do n't lie i wo n't be angry . 
no i do n't get that ! 
no .   you are the traitor .   you are murderer .   i am director .   action ! 
a job ? 
a job ?  ?   as a plumber ?  ?  ?   you think i come to america to work ! 
you 've got a call . 
what do you mean you know ?   he told you he was gonna propose to me ? 
oh my gd .   we were having lunch here .  he started making overtures  talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but i got a call to anchor  and i walked out on him .   i walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him !  ! 
a dog pissed on me !  !   i 'm gonna sue you for this !   you violated my civil rights ! 
your civil rights ?  !   you tried to rob me !   i could arrest you right now !  you 're lucky you 're walking away from this .   now get outta here . 
yeah ?   what kind ? 
i do n't know you think eddie will give me his autograph ? 
naw  i 'm sure the suspect 's not here . 
that 's why he was so quiet .   he was testing us . 
you hear that question garcia ? 
are n't you tired ? 
do n't you get it ?   he knew he was gonna get caught !   that 's why he videotaped eddie 's murder  he thinks he 's gonna get off . 
we 're in negotiations that 's correct . 
right .  just a sec . 
yes i know that sweetheart . 
yes well whatever it is they 're certainly not fooling around .  this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week . 
oh that 's such a delightful age . 
how is gregor ? 
yes it 's coming along very well . 
are you quite sure ? 
that 's right . 
i do n't think it has but i 'd like to check that .  simpson what 's the log on that ? 
well .  .  .  the crew is confined to the ship when we land at clavius .  we have to stay inside for the time it take to refit  about twentyfour hours .  and then we 're going to back empty . 
i take it this is something to do with the trouble they 're having up at clavius ? 
they always let me do anything .  i do n't want to pay for it .   i never paid for it in my life . 
yeah .   sure i 'm crazy in love with him who would n't be .  .  . 
what are you talking about ?  we did n't kill her  .  .  . 
sure anything you want . 
i can help you man but you gotta get me out .   i got to be on the street .   get me outta here . 
i 'm impressed with you too jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night . 
who gives a goddamn what you think ?  you 're just a crook that 's got a weekendpass  .  .  .  you 're not even a name anymore .  just a spear chucker with a goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues .  .  . 
how much ? 
yeah .   right . 
 .  .  . for three years ?   let 's hope it was n't a towaway zone . 
musta got some primo bondsman . 
i let women get to me .   the quest for pussy is the meaning of life  .  .  .  i got my own personal philosophy about em .   keep women separate from guns money and business  .  .  .  women are for spending money .   they got nothing to do with helping you make it . 
right .  if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping then you 're all set . 
do n't worry about it . 
you did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own .  .  . 
jack come on there is an official department policy about cop killings .  cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian .  .  .  in other words we ca n't seen like we 're in the revenge business .  .  .  i know we all know the truth 's a little different . 
yeah ? 
they ran .   as fast as they could .  caught a train . 
right .   i screwed up .   i fucked up .  i messed up .   anybody could have done better especially you .  i bet you 're real good at hitting targets through crowds . 
every last bit of it .   the big guy 's room was empty . 
one of  em 's in the slam . 
okay .   see you in the morning .  .  .  you know you ought to get some rest .  .  . 
have n't seen him for years .  that 's the truth . 
who gives a fuck what you think ? 
this is a  . 44 magnum the most powerful handgun in the world .  you gotta ask yourself just one question .  are you feelin' lucky ? 
i still do n't think it 's loaded . 
i 've been waiting a long time to hear you say that . 
that 's what i always say . 
well i been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years .   and you do n't exactly look like a shrink wearin' that dress .  .  . 
that 's no bull . 
whaddya want ?   i thought you were locked up
this ai n't a credit business . 
napoleon .  .  .  small . 
you know exactly where they are ! 
that 's me .   but i do n't know who she is .  .  .  where did you find her ? 
theoretically yes !  the four stones form the beam and the fifth element is supposed to stand in the middle there but .  .  .  i do n't have the reference book .  i 've never seen the stones work ! 
and you do n't know how they open is that what you are saying ? 
i did n't know your size . 
perfect . 
the fifth element .  .  .  the supreme being .  .  .  your wife .  .  . 
i .  .  .  i do n't know !  we hardly know each other .  .  .  it takes time ! 
i do n't have time .  .  .  i need to know . 
they are .  .  .  with me .  .  . 
you still pining for that two timing bitch .  forget her .  there are a million women out there .

you gotta push the little yellow button .  .  . 
actually only one cell survived .  .

thestones were n't aboard the ship . 
do n't worry sir .  i have the perfect one . 
i have to address the supreme council in 10 minutes .  just the facts general . 
recommendations . 
fine just fine !   i 'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now .   but it was n't easy .  my costs have tripled . 
we 've been all through that .   i 've been on my best behavior . 
sometimes you ca n't know what i 'm doing .   it 's better that way . 
what 's wrong ?   are you alright ? 
i ca n't tell you amy .   you know i ca n't .   you have to trust me .  .  . 
you could n't ? 
tom .  .  .  she 's dead .

how 'd you find me here ? 
i will never get tired of hurting you eddie so you might want to change your attitude . 
thirty thousand each that fucking cocksucker . 
that 's all ?   thirty each .   that 's all it took for you to murder her ? 
something like that . 
took it out the bathroom window .  buried it in the woods . 
do n't think i wo n't . 
i had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month .   do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt and try to fucking return it ? 
the only thing wrong is the cheap softcore crap you 're peddling eddie .   where do you get this stuff ? 
fuck you ! 
as mr .  christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend . 
i was well compensated . 
none of this would be happening if you would have left it alone .   if you were n't digging up a girl who died six years ago .   a girl no one even remembers . 
just tell me .   tell me some more of the secrets you and christian shared .  what kind of degenerate pervert was he really ?   what the fuck did he want with a snuff film ? 
my boss tells me i have to do more suggestive selling . 
how much ? 
how much do you make now ? 
see you then .   oh and do n't call me pops . 
wake up pops .   your education begins tonight . 
what you saw tonight we 're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend .   we 're talking about stuff where people get hurt .   specialty product . 
what other ways are there to get illegal films ?   who do you see ? 
what about me ? 
so you have a wife and kid waiting for you in pennsylvania .  .  .  what are you doing mixed up in all this ? 
alright i get the picture . 
he cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies photographs newsreel footage subliminal images .  thinks he 's making art . 
i 'm a working stiff pops . 
nobody knows his name .   that 's his thing .   he always wears a mask .   you never see his face .   he calls himself machine that 's what they call him .   machine . 
still do n't want to tell me what you 're doing ? 
his passing has left me with .  .  .  something of a dilemma .   a terrible terrible dilemma . 
we were married fortyfive years .  hard even for me to imagine .   we had our troubles .   there were plenty of places for him to be other than here but he was always loyal to me and i to him .   i loved him deeply . 
mrs .  christian .  .  .  please will you sit down a moment ?   i want you to listen carefully .  what you 're talking about is a snuff film .   but from what i know snuff films are a kind of .  .  .  urban myth .   like red light district folklore .   there 's no such thing i can assure you . 
you 've found missing persons before . 
okay i follow you so far .  .  . 
totalled together these five checks from five different accounts they equal one million dollars . 
you 're one hell of a detective mrs .  christian . 
i 've made progress .   i 'm in manhattan .   once a few more pieces fall into place i 'll drive to you and give you an update . 
yes but .  .  . 
right agent cole told me he 'd call and let you know to expect me .   he did n't call ? 
they hired you .   you 're like a private detective ? 
it got to be too much for him . 
you try going through what we did .  bob could n't take it that 's all .  christ there 's times when it still seems like i ca n't either . 
i had to ask .   i apologize . 
do you think the police did a good job ? 
it is .  .  . was .  it 's a zapper it might help me stay awake . 
no really it 's a fable .   the guardian of good' dreams .   it was like my teddy bear when i was growing up .

he says it 's easy .   especially with sad people .   with closedoff people . 
i watched from behind the stands .   did n't want to embarrass you ya know .   the drunk showed up that kind of thing .  .  . 
you sure you do n't want a ride to work ?

since my little girl became a mom .  .  . 
mark ! 
she killed herself .   her soul 's gonna be in torment . 
my undying love .   have some . 
yeah .  .  . 
that means they 're gonna give me the key to the pool so i can lock up when i 'm done . 
pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy .

well the queen is always physically larger then the others .   a termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it ca n't move at all .   it is fed and tended by drone workers defended by the warriors .   she is the center of their lives quite literally the  mother of their society . 
i 'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours .   the blast radius will be about thirty kilometers .   about equal to ten megatons . 
all right .   let 's get on it .   what 'll you need ? 
in seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of nebraska . 
i get the picture . 
what if i said i could get you reinstated as a flight officer ?  and that the company has agreed to pick up your contract ? 
what rank ?   i believe corporal hicks has authority here . 
but they will know about it burke .  from me .   just like they 'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fiftyseven colonists here 
these colonial marines are some tough hombres and they 're packing stateoftheart firepower .  nothing they ca n't handle .  .  . right lieutenant ? 
so .  .  . then the fusion containment shuts down .

well do you know where it 's set my dear ? 
where ? 
in a harem . 
what 's that ? 
turkish ?  oh if it 's turkish that 's different .  i want to be in it . 
perhaps .

wolfi i think your father 's tired .  i 'll cook us something here .

cattivo again court composer .  well tell him mozart .  name us a german virtue . 
yes ?

because i 've already found the most wonderful libretto ! 
and german ? 
oh yes .  absolutely .  german .  unquestionably ! 
thank you sire ! 
ah !  by all means . 
well yes i admit it is . 
very small pay i imagine .  i 'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer .  say an opera in german for our national theatre . 
he 's here . 
ahha .  well .  there it is .  good . 
oh yes .  oh i mean no  not exactly like this .  i mean today  just today stanzi  i remember now .  she had to go  yes !  she had to help her mother .  yes she 's like that .  her mother 's a very sweet woman you 'll see . 
pupils ?

i want you to come back with me to salzburg my son . 
but my penalty .  i 've got to have a penalty . 
i will sir . 
please .  i 'll give it back i promise .  please sir . 
ah love !  well of course in italy we know nothing about that . 
but this is absurd ! 
did you like it then ? 
but i ca n't lose this post i simply ca n't !  excellency please .  let 's go to the palace and you can explain to the emperor that herr sommer is an awful choice .  he could actually do musical harm to the princess ! 
you do n't mean to tell me you are living in poverty ? 
how is that possible ?  you give concerts do n't you ?  i hear they are quite successful . 
i 'm afraid not . 
come come mozart i 'm interested .  truly . 
really ?  why ? 
you burned the score ? 
it 's not fair that a man like that has power over our work . 
but there are those who have power over him .  i think i 'll take this up with the emperor . 
oh excellency would you ? 
did my work please you ? 
what dead ?  who is dead ? 
no no !  i promise you i 'll give you a wonderful piece  the best i ever can ! 
you 're so good to me .  truly .  thank you . 
do you mean that ? 
i have bad fancies .  i do n't sleep well anymore .  then i drink too much and think stupid things . 
i 'm too young to be so sick . 
would you ?  actually you could . 
please !  just one moment . 
oh no .  now for the fire .   strings in unison  ostinato on all  like this . 
but your majesty 
certainly herr director . 
but surely the emperor did n't mean to prohibit dancing when it 's part of the story . 
on the contrary . 
kapellmeister bonno count orsini rosenberg and court composer salieri . 
they hate my music .  it terrifies them .  the only sound italians understand is banality .  tonic and dominant tonic and dominant from here to resurrection !   baba !  baba !  baba !  baba !  anything else is morbid . 
may i just do that majesty ?  show you how it begins ?  just that ? 
what do you want ? 
that makes no difference .  all men are equal in god 's eyes . 
of course .  the man you accuse yourself of killing . 
but not his body . 
you must be mad . 
never mind . 
well done sire ! 
did we ? 
what ?  who the devil are you ? 
oh .  well thank you !  how wonderful .  some people get all the luck . 
no baron no .  i 'm afraid mozart is a lost cause .  he has managed to alienate practically the whole of vienna .  he is constantly drunk .  he never pays his debts .  i ca n't think of one person to whom i dare recommend him . 
and say everything went wonderfully .  a triumphdeluxe  say that !  tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times . 
yes .   and congratulations to all of you .  it was superb .

you 've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago . 
you 've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises lost a bit of blood but nothing too serious black and blue for a while .  you 'll have some dueling scars to boast of .  that lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow .  they say a mad man has the strength of ten . 
doctor my memory is fine .  it 's my sanity i 'm beginning to worry about . 
i 've told you it was n't a man .  it was an animal .  a big wolf or something .  a rabid dog .

very good brian .   about your report here .  the way to a torch 's heart is through his tools .  that 's how you know him .  it 's the way he talks to the fire .  and to you if you listen . 
if you remember sir my test scores were in the top 
trychtichlorate is a binary structured 
and the putty around the door ? 
i do n't work for them either . 
but he killed these guys . 
i 'm finished with swayzak .  i 'll do whatever you want me to do .  i just want to help catch the guy that burned tim .  you gotta give me another shot . 
did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report .  they did exactly one job  swayzak 's manpower study .  it 's not even really a company .  no employees no directors just a po box . 
yeah . 
just wondering . 
i hate hospitals .  you 're so .  .  .  so goddamn useless .  .  . 
and i 'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman brian . 
no you do n't understand i saved a mannequin . 
brian let me come to the point .  i 'd like to offer you a job . 
what the hell are we waiting for ? 
backdraft . 
could you believe that fire ?  man !  first day !  there i was adcox and me pullin' that lady right out of the fire 's fuckin' throat !  i love it here  no surround and drown for this company .  fighting 17th !  goddamn stephen's amazing .  you see how he took that fire by the balls ?  i 'm gonna be that good some day you watch . 
ah man is he usin' that line now on you ?  what you think he made that little gem up ?  jesus christ i used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning . 
that 's your job . 
no marty i do n't . 
sure it is .  you 're a virgin .  just like that nun .  and i 'm gonna rape you . 
he wants to know who brought in the chalice . 
that 's no mystery .  julio and paolo brought it in  you do n't want to hurt those boys do you ?  i mean they sure as hell have got something coming but it ai n't what the law wants to give them .  you understand ?   no .  how could you understand . 
very good .  very good .  the mets are gonna win tomorrow . 
i forgive you . 
fuck yesterday 's game .  the world series is seven games not six .  put in my bet . 
yeah really .  i 'm no fucking asshole man .  i 'm a fucking cop ! 
yeah sucker .  you better be there ! 
you knew them ?   who were they sister ?  who are these boys ?  what are the names of these  good boys you knew ? 
116 tru' dat .   true dat . 
she 's also moorish . 
seconds and thirds too . 
sloan is all dat .   i try her .   i 'm a trisexual . 
you 'd try anything .   i got first dibs .   you get ya own stuff . 
how you sound ? 
yes .   and i say yes because who is to judge ?   who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not ?   who ?   who can play god ? 
but the line has to be drawn . 
are you trying to excuse our holocaust ? 
i 'm not sure if i can deliver what you want . 
exactly ! 
so what .   we would just give the naacp a donation that would be the end of that .   no such thing as bad publicity .   so what .   earlier you said singing and dancing . 
what are you talkin' bout ?   it 's the move .   stay wid me now .   we 're movin' fast .   what does everybody else think about this ? 
you 're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot ? 
probably nuthin' but that 's why it 's such a sexy way to go .  sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook a different unique perspective .   a black director y 'know what he 's gonna do given the subject matter ?   with this kid the possibilities are endless . 
what are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky madonna video ? 
they did n't even view a rough cut just some scenes we quickly cut together . 
it 's me peerless . 
it 's been a long time . 
all i know is what happened to me .  all that other mess i just file into the life 's too short category . 
where do you go from here ? 
how can this be ?   you and me at the same time the exact same thought .  it 's scary . 
my problem is mantan the new millenium minstrel show . 
i thought it was appropiate . 
how long have you and hambone been hangin' out ? 
the first and only time .   a big mistake .   i 'm gonna have to ask you not to see mantan anymore . 
work related or otherwise ? 
hi mona . 
i 've always liked the format of rowan and martin's laughin . 
the best defense is offense . 
i 'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with .   you look beautiful like that . 
why do you say that ?   you 've never seen me . 
to come back to our roots . 
tomorrow is her birthday and i want to get her something really nice like a .  .  . 
 .  .  . to big .   the inbetween one not too tight not too lose . 
 .  .  . that was vicki her best friend .  dat dress will cast ya round .  .  . 
a song a comin' i feel . 
well homeboy looks like he 's at a funeral . 
are you trying to rap to me ? 
maybe you need to start . 
bert williams and the rest they had to black up .   they had no choice .   they were considered 35ths of a human being .   did you know that 's written in the constitution of the united states ? 
after my internship expired dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant . 
where are you bound for ? 
is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel ? 
do n't bully mr .  best .   here are the pistols .   god bless you my boy and when i count three fire . 
this may be a very good inn for germany but it would not pass in old ireland .   corbach is only a league off let us push on for corbach . 
sir i 'm a british officer . 
i am not sure .   the prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money he would have to fight for it . 
and so i am . 
your cousins go out with him . 
no the very same one my boy .   he recovered from his wound .   the ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him .   it was only made of tow .  do you think the dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred ayear out of the family ?   the plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way for the cowardly englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you .   but hit him you certainly did roderick and with a fine thick plugget of tow and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to .  we told your mother the story afterwards and a pretty scene she made . 
the coward ! 
which o 'higgins do you know ?   for i have never heard your name mentioned in my family . 
i have heard of them . 
repeat the words again and i run you through the body . 
i have orders to gag your honor if you cry out and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not . 
the gentleman has nothing contraband . 
i 'd give five years of my life to see the old country again the greenfields and the river and the old round tower and the burying place . 
we will practice in the mornings my boy and i 'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing . 
i have faced that problem before . 
i risk nothing for i am certain to kill him . 
not one . 
what !   you have not met a man worthy of your attention ? 
many worthy of attention but valuing is something more .   i could value only someone whom i loved . 
but if when i love i am unhappy i will know that my empty heart was my good fortune . 
that is true but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love . 
by loving you with no hope of possessing you . 
then i will respectfully take leave of her . 
yes  but i am afraid of being deceived . 
agreed . 
then you must get it . 
papa ? 
brooksy was better than you papa he used not to swear so and he taught me many good things while you were away . 
i beg your pardon ? 
faith sir if i want to learn good principles it 's surely better i should apply for them to your lady and your chaplin than to you ? 
i am sorry for you mr .  james .   i 'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting .   had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic ?   what are the odds gentlemen that i do n't live to see mr .  james hang yet ? 
you know that was like a quadruple negative ? 
it 's ten thirty in the morning . 
yeah and i could 've used the sleep .  i 'm supposed to meet people here tonight try and get some work going . 
who ? 
just safety your shit and get behind me okay ?  i 'll take care of this . 
what do we do ? 
it 's .  .  .  too slow . 
well it 's a game of anticipation that 's the beauty . 
that 'd be my reaction too 
i 'm serious 
mr .  hardy i joined the army for college money .  i did n't ask for any of this  i tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed .  you say finding those bodies 'll help me then go find them .  i do n't want to die . 
he 's telling the truth up to a point .  .  . 
tell us about the other guys the ones west weeded out . 
yeah .  spent half his time in the infirmary .  only reason he enlisted was his father .  west did n't section him till last week . 
pills shots you name it basic 's a lot easier when you do n't feel pain 
yeah . 
your weapons sergeant . 
i mean i killed him .   is n't that what we all wanted ? 
maybe but that do n't make me a killer 
there 's that word again .   as i told you i was n't in the room when everyone started shooting . 
i do n't know 
would i have called you if it was n't ?  if there was any other way 
well he 's a good soldier . 
no the problem is one 's dead one 's got a bullet in his arm and one wo n't talk .  the one who wo n't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pickup . 
without the body we have no physical proof .  we need a confession . 
from dunbar ?  i hate to break this to you but i do n't think he 's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty . 
i thought you said that was n't a compliment . 
west had a partner .  someone who knew how to get things done . 
you want to get into a finger pointing contest about character ?  the army kicked you out for drugs the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct ?  there 's only one criminal standing in this room and it 's you . 
for the last time i have no idea what you 're talking about 
he got me through basic and a lot of other stuff .  i owe him . 
why ? 
you 're off to a late start . 
so noted . 
they believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent . 
kendall maybe would have agreed but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin 
buttfucks the cabin ? 
positive .  hardy they planned this . 
you wanted to get the truth . 
is n't this how your story goes ? 
hardy for chrissakes 
then he 's mistaken .  you know i really do n't think my father would approve of this line of questioning 
what ? 
wait 
i scared dunbar into silence .  he 's been trying to cover for me the whole time .  we got here you came to see me .  .  .  i did n't know if i could trust him with that kind of secret 
what the fuck happened to you ?  one minute you 're next to me and the next you 're gone and the sky lights up like fucking christmas 
we 're not going anywhere . 
 failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself 
no no that was cadet dunbar 
in my time i have killed sixteen men for the good of my country sixteen men whose entrance into this army i could not condone as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense !  this base suffers an average of three training accidents a year unfortunate incidents that i will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me understand  give me a sir yes sir ! 
that 's great . 
kid you were a big fish in a small pond .  this here is the ocean and you 're drowning .  take my advice and go back to puddleville .  you 'll be happy there . 
thank you . 
this town is everything a man could ask for .  and if i were to end up here i 'd consider myself lucky .  but the fact is i 'm not ready to end up anywhere .

so i 've heard . 
i see .  i thank you for your time . 
will never told you that ?   probably just as well .  he would have told it all wrong anyway .  all the facts and none of the flavor . 
then you should n't have started with a question .  because people want to answer questions .  you should have started with the thing about icebergs is .  .  . 
okay .  okay . 
but you 're wrong .  i do know you at least by reputation .  edward bloom from ashton .  see i 'm actually engaged to a boy from ashton .  don price .  he was a few years older than you . 
i was n't expecting you . 
this was on his sales route so he was through here all the time .  everyone in town knew him . 
you did n't become crazy . 
down the hall on the right .  the door sticks .  you have to really pull it . 
probably tonight . 
what about the details ?  how they fell in love .  the circus .  the war .  you never told me any of that . 
that 's because most of it never happened . 
mmm what .  i know better than to argue romance with a french woman . 
everyone loves my father .  he 's a very likeable guy . 
but it 's not true . 
of course . 
yes .  but that 's a different .  .  . 
but i understand you mom .  i always have .

it would n't hurt to hear the plan i guess . 
now how are you going to do that ?

this kid this package boy could bring down the whole east coast .  if he decides to turn states he could dismantle us .  .  .  totally .  but it looks like for now he 's content with just killing us one by one .  and even worse the kid is good at it .  i mean i had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and did n't even know it .

we do not ask for your poor or your hungry . 
it is your corrupt we claim . 
with every breath we shall hunt them down . 
do not kill do not rape do not steal .  these are principles which every man of every faith can embrace . 
these are not polite suggestions .  they are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost .  
do you know where that term comes from ?  in the early 1900 's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb . 
yeah well .  .  .  i 'm an expert in name ology . 
of course they were .  how many ? 
i felt it would bring closure to our relationship !

these guys were pros .  i think they were coming for one target the fag man he was the .  .  . 
the fat man . 
well freud was right .  so you think they came for the fag man huh ?  and what do you base this upon ? 
yeah .  some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead or silver . 
crime of passion .  he just went nuts .  he would have shot everyone in here .  he just ran out of bullets . 
chief what the fuck is this ? 
shit !  shit ! 
we have to go now .   we 're on the lamb . 
yyes my son . 
you feel ? 
it is easy to be sarcastic about religion .  it is harder to take small hints from god your feelings and listen to them .  .  .  to take a stand . 
thank you father thank you .   whatever .  goodbye amen . 
he 's a nigger . 
yeah .  and uh he 's pissed off .  he says why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot ?  and he tells him he 's gonna grant all his three wishes but he 's gonna give all the black guys .  .  . 
joey bevo said it was important .  said i had to give it to him myself . 
making hutch david soul ? 
dignan it 's 
the point is the killer always goes may i speak to starsky ?  he says his name . 
no .  this is he . 
dignan !  stop ! 
i do n't like to use that credit card dignan . 
that 's real cool anthony .  yeah i wore boots .  my parents would n't buy me any 200 running shoes like yours .  i was n't spoiled . 
ok .  go ahead . 
no kidding . 
maybe he just went to the store . 
we said 48 hours . 
yeah .  it 's pretty good . 
it 's like we 've finally arrived . 
he was all right . 
roger . 
good .  it 's supposed to be . 
it was bob .  his walkie talkie 's busted . 
i do n't know . 
applejack 's stuck in the elevator ? 
i 'll see you there . 
what are you talking about ? 
he did ? 
we have n't heard from applejack since he got out of the hospital .  his case got dismissed . 
we 're not sure yet .  it 's going to need some repairs . 
scale the 
the fear of death the pain of consciousness .   did you mix this martini ? 
yeah . 
because i was like you once .  and there was no one there to help me . 
future man .  you know .  cause he looks like he 's from the future . 
you 've only been playing for two weeks bob .  it takes a long time to learn this game . 
yeah .  one minute you 're studying great expectations and the next minute you 're drawing the holy mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend . 
yeah but he still has the aggravation .  three days sitting in a cell . 
jesus christ !  no . 
true . 
it seemed like a good idea at the time . 
yes .  i did . 
i 'll just drive my car . 
i ca n't believe you said that . 
i warned you dignan . 
they also found my two beam scale in the garage . 
well obviously we got to go back . 
bob that makes no sense . 
dignan .  you 're going to give me those keys or you 're going to get hurt . 
goddammit dignan !  it 's my car !  if you do n't give me my keys i swear to god 
i know it 's not . 
anthony .  bad news . 
i do n't expect an apology and i do n't even want one .  i just want us to 
bob you 're lying ! 
yeah .  we 're in the elevator .  how 's it look back there ? 
i 'm working on it . 
i know bob .  you were on a secret mission . 
he said what ? 
that 's not gonna fly . 
no .  .  .  it must have been bourne . 
jesus .  .  .  i zorn .  .  .  i have to call his family .  tell them .  .  . 
why not ?  it was just money . 
and danny zorn what was that ? 
in the end honestly it 's hubris .  simple hubris .  you reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are . 
okay .  .  .  
no .  it 's because you do n't know how they died . 
that 's not what happened to your parents . 
then what ? 
a voice .  a voice from the states .  someone new . 
conklin up front . 
no .  there 's nothing new . 
you 're sure ?   we should still  we should write it down . 
 where ?  
 make the left  toward the bridge 
 it 's just him ?  
tell me later . 
i only dream about people who are dead . 
last week ?  when ? 
conklin !  stuff on conklin !  
there was a girl in paris .  part of the program .  she used to handle the medication . 
ramstein air base germany .   before the wall fell you would have woken up in a russian prison hospital . 
do you think you can read ?  are you well enough ? 
i 'm working on it . 
 uplink all relevant files to kim    and i want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with treadstone 
so let the council swear publicly . 
clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here . 
 .  .  . his majesty was quite keen that you should understand 
look at me .  i said look at me ! 
you mock us with a smile ? 
i respect him .  at worst he was a worthy enemy .  show mercy .  .  .  oh thou great king .  .  .  and win the respect of your own people . 
before he lost his powers of speech he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know wallace was dead . 
that 's just a dream william ! 
we 've lived a dream together .  a dream of freedom ! 
no .  one of us is enough . 
how many ? 
we do n't split up ! 
he broke because of me .  i saw it .  he lost all will to fight . 
we must have alliance with england to prevail here .  you achieved that !  you saved your family increased your lands !  in time you will have all the power in scotland !  .  .  .  yet you grieve . 
let her speak . 
it matters not he is thy king ! 
i 'll invite you again but your mother thinks i 'm crazy . 
some nights .  i have dreams .  mostly dreams i do n't want .  i started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when i did sleep i 'd dream only of the ride and the adventure . 
tonight then . 
my parents are growing suspicious !  i ca n't keep meeting you every night ! 
peace is made is such ways . 
she was my wife .  we married in secret because i would not share her with an english lord .  they killed her to get to me .  and she was pregnant . 
i cannot love you for the sake of revenge . 
no .  but can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost ?  or simply love me .  .  .  because i love you ? 
if i swear to him then everything i am is dead already . 
it will numb my wits and i must have them all .  if i 'm senseless or if i wail then longshanks will have broken me . 
no english lord would trust an irishman ! 
he 's saying it 's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year .  overload city .  sat about the gist of it doc ? 
can you protect me ? 
i ai n't bullshitting .  jesus speaks to me in my dreams . 
weirder than this ? 
no protecting her . 
are you sure ?  not even with my father ? 
where are my goddamn books ? 
my journals !  where are they ? 
like ozzy . 
what ? 
huh ? 
he must be .  they 're letting him go right ? 
i know but .  .  . 
those are your clothes silly . 
go on .  sit down . 
now 's the only time !   today you get a chance to redeem yourself .  start over with a clean slate .  tabula rasa 
nice to see you too .  can i come in ? 
i get it .  you can drop it now . 
oh i 'm sorry .  does my line of work make you uncomfortable precious ? 
the bottom .  when you 're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack . 
let me ask you a question .  just a little one that 's been gnawing at me for years . 
know what ? 
i 'm over it .  whenever i try to help anyone it all turns to shit . 
stop !  take me back ! 
he saved mrs .  halpern ?  please the twisted fuck . 
when my folks split they gave me and tommy a choice who we wanted to live with .  i could n't stand my dad but i knew if i moved to my mom 's i 'd never see you again . 
why not ?  but that 's not how things wound up .  i 'm with lenny lenny 's your friend .  and there it ends . 
duly noted .  now i 'm gonna ask you for one last favor . 
i 'll do whatever you want .  you do n't want me to ever see kayleigh again fine .  just let crockett go .  besides you kill him now and they 'll stick you in juvy for sure .  and i know you 'd never leave your sister alone with your father . 
sorry mrs .  t .  he 's been out of sorts lately . 
i thought i was the bad guy ! 
yeah you do that lenny . 
yes ? 
could i speak to you for just a moment please ? 
i should have known . 
 will he keep his word ? 
and he never knew and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart ?  that would be all right would n't it ? 
go back to bulgaria . 
monsieur rick ! 
yes sir . 
i 'm awfully sorry . 
my dear rick when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy ? 
i never drink in the morning .  and every time you send my shipment over it 's always just a little bit short . 
rick do n't be a fool .  take me into your confidence .  you need a partner . 
good day . 
this morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave casablanca . 
and the other alternative ? 
uh huh . 
looking for a job . 
no no no no .  we must leave . 
no no .  not at my hotel .  i uh i have things to do in the city before i leave .  i 'll meet you at the station huh ? 
why did you have to come to casablanca ?  there are other places . 
well you can tell me now .  i 'm reasonably sober . 
i do n't think i will rick . 
no rick .  no you see victor laszlo is my husband .  .  .  and was even when i knew you in paris . 
and as far away from major strasser as possible . 
to tell you the truth i am frightened too .  shall i remain here in our hotel room hiding or shall i carry on the best i can ? 
signor ferrari is the fat gent at the table . 
go ahead . 
is n't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog ? 
yes rather . 
yes i get the point . 
i know a good deal more about you than you suspect .  i know for instance that you are in love with a woman .  it is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman .  the first evening i came here in this cafe i knew there was something between you and ilsa .  since no one is to blame i i demand no explanation .  i ask only one thing .  you wo n't give me the letters of transit .  all right .  but i want my wife to be safe .  i ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from casablanca . 
keep it .  you 'll need it in america . 
oh never mind about that .  you wo n't have any trouble in lisbon will you ? 
yes . 
yes .  what is it you want ? 
no .  please monsieur it is a little game we play .  they put it on the bill i tear the bill up .  it is very convenient . 
this is a very interesting cafe .  i congratulate you . 
i slept very well . 
that 's strange .  nobody is supposed to sleep well in casablanca . 
with pleasure .  wo n't you sit down ? 
thank you . 
this is hardly the time or the place . 
major strasser my aide lieutenant casselle . 
thank you . 
how do you do mr .  rick ? 
you were n't always so carefully neutral .  we have a complete dossier on you . 
and if it should change ? 
but everybody 's having such a good time . 
but i have no excuse to close it . 
because one you 've bet ten thousand francs he 'd escape .  two you have the letters of transit now do n't bother to deny it .  and well you might do it simply because you do n't like strasser 's looks .  as a matter of fact i do n't like him either . 
and i 'm taking a friend with me .  one you 'll appreciate . 
there 's still something about this business i do n't quite understand .  miss lund she 's very beautiful yes but you were never interested in any woman . 
call off your watchdogs you said . 
maybe but it seemed like a good time to start . 
uh huh . 
will i see you tonight ? 
 sacha call a cab . 
take your hands off me ! 
you will forgive my curiosity mr .  blaine .  the point is an enemy of the reich has come to casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us . 
but think of all the poor devils who cannot meet renault 's price .  i get it for them for half .  is that so parasitic ? 
yeah but i ai n't got time to spend the money i make here . 
sorry . 
no .  not me boss . 
please boss let 's go .  ai n't nothing but trouble for you here . 
the germans 'll be here pretty soon now and they 'll come looking for you .  and do n't forget there 's a price on your head . 
catch another fish tomorrow . 
stay calm identify the problem .  problem rope fraying .   solution fix rope . 
moon's too bright . 
i 'm putting it off . 
ca n't kill another one .   ca n't .   ca n't kill my friends anymore . 
why do they have to die for me ? 
the sea is lovely dark and deep . 
die tomorrow or die today . 
it 's a fucking soccer ball you idiot . 
look again asshole .   it 's a mirage . 
i 've got lots of time . 
yeah ? 
so simple to say so hard to do . 
the regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow . 
what about the sender ? 
kamal is not here .   we are very defused . 
jesus .   i got it working .  .  .  you have no idea how hard it was .  .  .  they 're finally a team .  .  . 
baloney .   i do see the damn big picture . 
for all those vacation days you got coming . 
this is amber .   her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack . 
hallelujah . 
some new things would be useful .  i do n't need any new help . 
he 's still a boyout in the world he 's still a boy . 
it 's that mrs .  goodhall you have to be careful of wilbur . 
i did like it .  all i said was it 's not king kong' . 
she was torn apart !  she died of a broken heart . 
you think ?  maybe i was .   i love this place ! 
yes .  .  .  and no .  when you come here you do n't really care about the movie . 
at least you were never lonely . 
i miss things .  i miss .  .  .  people .   i miss reading to the boys . 
we have to wait and see .  i think that for everything in life you have to wait and see . 
i told her !  she does n't feel she can do that .  something about her father not letting her go anywhere .  .  . 
i know .   is that nothing . 
go anywhere ?  of course not !  that would be doing something would n't it ?  we would n't want to do something .  let 's just sit here all night ! 
you got up !  you did something !  if you keep this up you might be in danger of making a decision ! 
please do n't .  .  . 
hi .  .  . 
rose i know what 's going on .  homer told me .  i got pregnant tooabout a year ago .   i 've been through this . 
why ? 
no .  it ai n't muddy .  muddy 's just .  .  . 
they wanted a girl . 
nobody 's asked for me have they ? 
only the right people can have you curly . 
he 's leaving .  .  . 
edna !  come dance with me !  let 's be foolish tonight . 
alcohol killed himhe drank himself to death . 
i do n't remember . 
i must have been dreaming of kissing someone . 
it 's okayi do n't mind . 
we 're heading back to cape kenneth . 
actually i volunteered . 
yes .  they pick fruit all kinds .  they travel up and down the coast with the seasons .   the trick to mr .  rose is you have to let him be the boss . 
i 'm happy i amuse you . 
pretty ai n't it ?  you a plumber ? 
yeah you is .  i know when people is in trouble and you is . 
i do n't like watching anyone be sick . 
i know more than i want to know about it .  who 's the father ? 
rose listendo n't do anything .  you know i mean to yourself .  please listen .  .  . 
what have you two been doin' to make it look so nice ? 
they ai n't dropsi picked em off the tree ! 
well muddy we can look at all these angry stars homer 's been readin' to us about . 
yeah you really showed him daddy you just about cut your own hand off and all you cut off him was his clothes ! 
really ?  wish we had met eight hours ago . 
i envy you guys .  taking a chance like that . 
yeah but come on .  .  .  all i get to do is cry and get insulted . 
the cash we fleeced off of him was collection money .  he was supposed to take that money and give it to the king earlier yesterday like he does every thursday .  cept this time he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the king 's money back before any body says boo . 
no that was the only semifucking smart thing he said !  except anybody that 's ever met big al knows that the only thing he 's comfortable doing alone is eating .  this guys tells this guy that guy tells some other guy eventually it works it 's way back to someone who works for the king and 
people have tried this before jake .  it 's never worked .  teddy fraiser and his crew went on vacation in chicago for it .  last year mumps got pinched in l . a . 
it 's alright .  grant 's one of the good guys . 
we 'll use the euc . 
buddy that was business .  besides you have more crew .  then there 's you .  .  . 
you 're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything are you ? 
yeah well sobo 's kid needs braces . 
good boy . 
my wife and i are just taking a little vacation . 
listen to me !  it went to shit .  it happens sometimes . 
you interested in a little work ? 
hey i got it !  take some mental notes .  you just might learn something here . 
it 's just that i left my asshole decoder ring at home so how do i know not to worry ? 
and some new clothes . 
then show me how . 
uhhuh . 
miles .  .  . 
breasts . 
good point . 
what are you talking about ?  yes we have .  and we would have been beautiful about it .  we would 've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the king with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it .  then we woulda moved on til the next local putz caught on . 
jake ?  customs ? 
you know this is kind of embarrassing but my wallet was stolen yesterday and i 'm afraid the ticket was in it .  but the name 's pearson . 
point is you do n't go through with this he 's going to go after you next .  and he do n't even like you jake . 
you 're a weasel . 
that 's what i like about you lupus .  you 're a free thinker .  do n't let the king tell you different . 
what ? 
sorry .  what ? 
pretty much . 
the king . 
i do n't doubt your talent .  you looking for that place in the hall of fame ? 
so what do you want ? 
i want to get out from under all this for good .  and i want to fuck them all doing it . 
look i 'm not a confrontational person by nature . 
we 're here . 
i 've been looking for this jake vig for some time now .  problem is the guy 's the invisible man .  a spook a spectre a ghost .  then like a gift jake 's good buddy and member of his crew alfonse moorely is found the other day with a hole in his head . 
what do you want ? 
not everyone 's on the take walter . 
i do n't trust anybody .  you see how bad this guy wants vig ?  it 's like a sickness .  i say we collar vig ourselves .  we got vig then we got leverage .  and we trade vig for that tape .  i want to see it right in front of my face . 
that 's what i 'm talking about . 
my car 's in the garage . 
is that your idea of arithmetic ? 
she went back to south africa . 
i want a job giles . 
i take it back .  you 're not a cop any more .  you 're a store detective . 
what do i mean to you ?  i want to know .  tell me . 
is that your idea of a winner ?  he does n't give a shit about anyone .  he uses people and 
it 's not that . 
that 's stupid .  what are the odds of you being seen with me ? 
i was born in the transkei on the wild coast . 
remember the guy who cheated at the table ? 
i know that .  but you can now . 
forget it jani .  it 'll never work . 
no forget it .  the bet 's off . 
it 's a shame there are n't more men in the world like you . 
yes .  i 'm all over that now .  jack hold on a minute .  there 's someone here who wants to talk to you .  .  . 
i 'm a witch .  a white witch .  why do n't we move on ? 
coming up to two years now .   but i was away for six months . 
no thanks matt .  i need my eight hours . 
i do n't cheat jack .  you 've got it wrong . 
because if a supervisor knew i 'd seen you and i had n't reported it i 'd lose my job as well .  and i ca n't afford that . 
good call .  help yourself . 
that bitch ?  no . 
i put them on together . 
we tried .  but there was n't enough business .  the punters like company . 
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours . 
we do .  
bomb 20 to sergeant pinback .  roger i read you continue . 
are you willing to entertain a few concepts ? 
that 's it . 
yes well .  .  . 
hmmm .  .  . 
i have no proof that it was false data . 
i 'll check it . 
okay doolittle i 'll have it in a minute . 
waves would be peaking really high and glassy .  hit that water .  ridin' the wall just perfect . 
i really think i should try and locate it immediately .  might be something important . 
what 's that sir ? 
ah so many malfunctions .  .  .  why do n't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me ?  oh well did you try the azimuth clutch ? 
it did n't work ? 
well what you might try is 
what were you saying commander about the bomb ? 
sir ? 
no .  .  .  cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity .  all of them work for me and you do n't .  .  .  let 's go . 
actually that 's not gonna be necessary . 
he 's got exposure .   he sees you starin' at fifteen to life there 's a chance you could roll over cop a plea who knows ?  man's figured the odds .  .  . and he ca n't take a chance . 
this wo n't hurt .   triple dose of insulin you 'll go into a coma couple minutes you 'll stop breathing and on a busy night the coroner will probably mistake it for an o . d .   plus it 's way classier than blowin' your brains out . 
you did n't tell me you lived with her . 
trying to have a relationship with you max is like standing in a fog bank .   you know you 're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are . 
i see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact .  .  .  at least i tried . 
thank god . 
we 're just a little tense right now .  .  .   it 's okay . 
lauren's not my wife . 
what 's your shot in all this ?   being a famous anonymous underground pirate cyberjournalist ca n't be much of a payday . 
me ?   you 're the one who tried to rip off this piece . 
am i s 'posed to be grateful ? 
i have n't been able to get you off my mind . 
you lost me . 
the bar code on your neck max .   i know who you are and i know who you 're running from . 
yeah .  .  . a madeup creature .   like in mythology .  .  . with the head of a lion the body of a goat and the tail of .  .  . 
she 's put her life on the line and her faith in me . 
my mother used to say the universe is right on schedule .   everything happens like it 's supposed to . 
open it . 
she may be easy on the eyes but she 's trouble trust me .   hot run to twoohtwo sansomme . 
none . 
with me where he 's been after work three sometimes four nights a week for the last two months .  .  .  we have what you might call an intimate relationship . 
let go of my hand . 
now here 's how it 's gonna be lydia .  you 're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails and you 're gonna go home and figure out your marriage instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do understand ? 
i understand . 
and if i ever catch you coming near my man again .  .  . 
then what ? 
nothing on hannah ? 
how 's this about me ? 
i 'm you i take that money and get outta town while you can . 
sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone ? 
got a pencil ? 
a long time . 
unlikely . 
but of course there 's nothing self serving in that scenario . 
only way you 're ever gonna find out is reincarnation .  .  .  fact is you are gonna pay me and i am gonna provide you with a service . 
what you gonna put me on your christmas card list ? 
probably a touch of what 's going around . 
right the big oneoh .

i found it . 
did you see it ? 
he was fine when he left here and now look at him . 
why is he sitting up like this ?  he needs rest . 
pull the other one why do n't you !  we made a deal ! 
it 's quite nutritious sir . 
i really do n't think that 's necessary treves .  i 'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case such as they are . 
speaking is one thing treves but can the man comprehend ? 
he need n't .  i have no desire to cause him any discomfort .  did you make those inquiries we spoke about ? 
yes i 'm very sorry to have wasted your time sir .  i just felt that i had to do anything i could to protect him . 
yes i think i can . 
no not that way .  broadneck and the others do n't like to deal with patients directly .  it makes them queasy .  .  .  do you have any photographs of mr .  merrick ? 
of course .  how long did you and mr .  treves prepare for this interview ? 
i am very pleased to meet you . 
i hope we can talk together again sometime .  good day . 
mmmm .  hodges pierce come closer .  mr .  hill take hold of the rope please .  it 's a machine accident .  i expect you 'll be seeing a good deal of this .

i promise you .  you will never see the inside of that horrible place again .  you will never ever go back to the workhouse .  .  .  or that man .  it 's a splendid room do n't you think ? 
oh our relatives .  .  .  the children . 
your mother ? 
i 'm sure that if mr .  merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they 'd see that he 's the exception to their rule .  now i 'm not expecting miracles .  i 'm not saying he 'll be able to read or write but i do think that i can get him to speak for himself .  i 'm going to arrange things with carr gomm right now .   that was very good john very good .  that 's all for today .  we shall do some more tomorrow .  mothershead ? 
when i left him he was in his bed safe and sound .

why .  .  .  should you care ? 
tell me your name ? 
well .  .  .  no .  .  . 
i do n't know !  i just did !

even then i did n't believe you entirely .  i thought how could you be talking to me if you could n't talk to people ? 
but my sleeping is really fucked up .

debbie says that if women are to take charge again they must do it in the feminine way they must n't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods .  she says it is up to women to show themselves better than men to love men set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the new age .  she 's a real dreamer that debbiedear . 
countess .  i 'm really in a dither .  she 's turned my head .

i do n't know this place is really dark i ca n't see a thing .  .  . 
what you got peters ? 
nsa encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message .  .  . 
in an emergency the charges detonate in series destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship .  that way if the gravity drive malfunctions the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat . 
it 's complicated .  .  . 
what about it ?

i 'm not sure i believe .  but then i had no one to instruct me .  i had no mother .  .  .  and my father abandoned me at birth . 
friend ? 
i do know that for the sympathy of one living being i would make peace with all .   i have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine .  and rage the likes of which you would not believe .  if i cannot satisfy the one i will demonically indulge the other .  that choice is yours .   you 're the one who set this in motion frankenstein . 
we 'd travel north my bride and i .  to the furthest reaches of the pole where no man has ever set foot .  there we would live out our lives .  together .   no human eye would ever see us again .  this i vow .

in other words no . 
yep . 
you two ought to start a standup act because you 're just wasting your humor on me .

he signaled the ranger . 
gotcha ! 
what am i supposed to do seth ?  he recognized us . 
no . 
do they have a waterbed ? 
they do n't have anything except four walls and a roof and that 's all we need . 
these guys ai n't spic firecracker salesman from tijuana .  they do n't even know the meaning of the word barter .   you wanna stay in el ray ?  you give them thirty percent of your loot .  it 's scripture .  so it is written so shall it be done .  you want sanctuary you pay the price and the price is thirty percent . 
what 'd ya see ? 
i heard it on the radio .  we gotta get our asses into mexico tonight .  carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side then carlos and his boys will escort us to el ray and 
what ? 
wickwire thomas dane .   see what you can find . 
who signed as his sponsoring officer ? 
uh .  .  .  do n't see it .   there 's no signature .   but hang on  there 's a note to see addendum .   checking .  .  . 
what 'd you find kathy ? 
of course but there 's more 
really i have no problem with 
it 's this doublestandard the separate quarters the deferential treatment .   it 's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met . 
i 'm not sure what 
would you have the discretion to end it right then and there ? 
she made it through s . e . r . e .  training .   got a call this morning from 
this is just a test case o 'neil .  but if it works out  if you work out  it could well change the navy 's official policy on women in combat .   or actually its official nonpolicy .   now who 's your immediate superior there ? 
there 'll be more to follow  but yes dear right now you 're the pick of a very large litter .   and your success would mean a lot .   jumping now .  .  . 
hmmm .   maybe i 'll ask when i see you in person . 
gonna be visiting that allwoman's america 's cup team in a few weeks  if i were a gambler i 'd say dennis o 'conner 's days are numbered .   but they 're in san diego so i thought i 'd take a quick promenade of the base . 
jordan .   might we do this over lunch tomorrow ?   i do very much want to talk but now is scarcely 
what he did was light the bandwagon on fire .   because he knows what i know  that american families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm 's way . 
what are you saying ?   that a women's life is more valuable than a man's ?  that a women's death hurts a family more ? 
jordan .   i do n't expect you to fully understand this  but sometimes there 's more to be gained from the fight than the victory . 
i 'd go special reconnaissance .  every bit as tough  and we have a 60 percent dropout rate among the men . 
then i suggest we start there . 
so it really has nothing to do with actual brain size ? 
flea cool cortez newman  take your minis hit the water .   go go ! 
come on montgomery .  .  . 
you 're wanted at the c . o . s . 
get it up ! 
i 'll try anyway sir . 
quickhit technique used by capone .  rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles .   all his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride .   check the files  dprk57  i doped it out as a contingency plan  seal team infiltrates picks up the package links up with recovery sub .   but do n't waste time opening and closing hatches .   they just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters . 
you know royce i got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets too . 
still ca n't make up your mind huh ?  gotta go royce . 
almost like someone put him up to it .   okay who ? 
i 'm tired of fighting back .   i just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world okay ? 
sounds like an amazing coincidence . 
what ? 
mccool 's that same rank .   we 're both j . g . s . 
dad . 
green eggs and ham .   you 're not going to get anywhere .   you might as well put me in the cage . 
should i be afraid ? 
i think you 're the liar . 
you think we should go easy on women o 'neil ? 
okay o 'neil .   so you 've impressed all the others .   now try me . 
hmm .   let 's aim higher . 
women . 
this is what you get for brain picking an old cia spook .   but if i needed to control the outcome of this test case that 's how i 'd do it .   a maninplace .   makes everything very controllable . 
shut up .  how can you eat like that ? 
big bites . 
nearly four years .  .  . 
oh yes he will . 
no i 'm into earthworms now .  you would n't be interested .  they 're real boring creatures .  very reliable dependable no surprises .  .  . 
i do n't get it .  if it 's the first of its kind how can it be pregnant ? 
you never said it was off the record . 
i thought you said there 'd only be a dozen eggs . 
oh my god !  they 're coming ! 
somehow i never thought your life was this exciting . 
yeah well he just turned up in new jersey at the military command post .  somehow all this is related to what happened down in panama .  there 's a story here .  i know it .  you got any tape or glue ? 
i left my forgery kit back at the office . 
this is not the place .  .  . 
what do we know ?  it was first sighted off the french polynesian pacific .  an area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years . 
um excuse me sir but the situation's more complicated than that .  the blood i recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has . 
so after we kill the creature we 'll begin a search for the nest . 
it may be too late by then .  these eggs will hatch very quickly . 
it 's the french secret service . 
why are you telling this to me ? 
your talking about the nuclear testing in the pacific . 
let 's hope we are not the hors d 'oeuvres . 
5557600 .  tell them it 's a code dragonfly .  they should get you through . 
wait .   au revoir . 
do n't do that .  i 'm not kidding . 
right .  .  .  sorry sir . 
come with me .  i 'll explain on the way . 
it 's a damn rock monster !  !  !  it does n't have motivation ! 
that 's your problem .   you were never serious about the caraft .  .  .   i 'm a rock .  .  .  i just want to be a rock .  .  .  still .  peaceful .  .  tranquil .  .   .  .  . oh but what 's this ?   something 's making noise .  .  .  no not noise no .  .  .  movement .   vibrations .   make the vibrations stop they go straight into me like a knife !  .  .  .  i must crush the thing that makes the vibrations .  .  . 
i was staying in character .   egomaniacal sonofabitch ? 
jason what have you gotten us into ? 
you could order something in . 
shit !  i 'm doing it !  i 'm repeating the damn computer ! 
oh .   okay . 
excuse me guys . 
i .  .  . well uh .  .  .  yes absolutely . 
it 's suicide . 
i 'm just a glorified extra fred .   i 'm a dead man anyway .  if i 'm going to die i 'd rather go out a hero than a coward . 
maybe you 're the plucky comic relief you ever think of that ? 
whatever the one with the hologram .  the wall of fire . 
where 'd they go ?  back inside ? 
but i 'm the commander ! 
we 're going to fire everything we 've got at him all right ? 
listen sarris you ca n't blame me for trying .  .  . 
no i do n't think so .  .  .  wait .  they 're not but .  .  .   something is .   oh my god . 
why does this sound so familiar ? 
no i do n't .  but i know somebody who does . 
this is great !   they 're going to start eating each other out there . 
do n't do it tommy .  he 's not worth it . 
we have become aware of these concepts only recently .  in our dealings with sarris .  often sarris will say one thing and do another .  promise us mercy and deliver destruction .  .  .  it is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost .   but if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with sarris . 
why do n't you just turn it on and see ? 
okay let 's go . 
good work tommy .   let 's go ! 
they always say that . 
they do n't trust me that 's the truth is n't it ?   sam adams never did . 
the army can survive without me . 
you are never never to touch my guns !   do you understand !  ? 
a lot of years have gone by . 
you 've served me loyally year after year without complaining .  i 've thought hard about you this past winter .   i want to free you wil .   i want to give you your freedom after this battle is fought . 
no .   i guess . 
more than that sir .  .  .  my orders from congress . 
no one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than i .   but if victory is remote and there 's any hope for a negotiated peace we must keep this army intact . 
sir arnold is a traitor . 
to hell with arnold .  .  . 
a fleet ? 
george !   so good to be back ! 
well george congress just passed a resolution censuring arnold for destruction of government property .  i would n't cast my fate with that man . 
no .   as a matter of fact i have n't the slightest idea what you 're talking about . 
how can you say that ? 
you must be very rich . 
my god what ? 
you 're no fool george .   you never have been . 
virginia is outraged with your order allowing negroes to fight in the army .   there 's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal .   they wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests . 
our kind' ?   what is that supposed to mean ?   these men are all i have left and they stay because they will fight !   they desire it !   they seek it !   of course virginia is terrified !   for my soldiers this is a war to obliterate the upper class' from the face of the earth !  should i tell them all to go home because if they win it will ruin me !  ?   it is impossible for me to imagine that negroes are fighting so that only white men may be free !  if we win this war they will own this country too ! 
sir congress has n't issued their pay for two months many have not eaten properly for at least that long .   you 're being a little hard on them do n't you think ? 
you do n't believe i can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism ? 
and what is this then ?   been off to fight the french because you are a patriot ?   or is this you gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war !  ? 
is it ?   william says now you have requested a british commission why not colonial ?   i 'll clear it up for you sir because as a british officer you can lord over colonial yokels  more than that it will even get you into polite society !  your dream come true george the only dream that really matters to you . 
really ?   which precious homily was it ? 
mankind is born free but everywhere he is in chains .  .  . 
oh but you must not mind my talking about you !   in fact william says my main job here at belvoir is to civilize you to make an honest english gentleman out of you . 
it 's the freest land on earth . 
well we must be who we must be .  .  . 
you 're out of your mind ! 
and dost thou live to ask it ? 
that land belongs to the strongest . 
this this is life indeed !   life worth preserving such life as juba never felt till now . 
you did n't have to shoot him bo .  we coulda just beat him up some . 
his foot .  jeez poor ronnie .  .  . 
whoa .  .  .  this is the man used to jump offa high buildings ? 
that 's right me . 
harvey keitel .  yeah .  maybe .  he was pretty good in the movie fingers . 
yeah morgan freeman .  but he 's a colored guy . 
i 'm with you on that .  and do n't you think it needs a good female part ?  increase the romance angle . 
get something going there . 
she 's .  .  .  young . 
what money ? 
i 'll find it . 
i 'm at 8150 wonderland avenue .  it 's right off laurel . 
you must be makin' some big deals doin' lunch in a place like this ? 
you serious ? 
the airport . 
are you the guy they called ray bones ? 
what three hundred grand ? 
that 's correct .  look at me . 
sovereign . 
movie producer ?  yeah why not . 
well since leo 's name was on the passenger list .  .  . 
but you work for the casino ? 
not really . 
you got that on the brain harry .  if you 're so scared of em why 'd you take their money to vegas to begin with ? 
one of his best parts . 
no his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed mt .  whitney . 
the problem is murray .  he and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the kern a few weeks ago .  murray never made it back . 
so you 're thinking what if i was to put you next to my dry cleaner .  ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie . 
never say anything unless you have to . 
you do n't open an account leo you put it in a safe deposit box .  dip in whenever you want . 
i would n't let her if she tried .  why i 'm here leo basically is to save your ass . 
i know who he works for .  where 's your phone . 
that 's right .  three percent . 
lemme get this straight you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before ? 
ripped nylons work .  makes the shot more real . 
yeah .  when you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished .  .  .  when you give us all that look joan crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence .  not even in mildred pierce  which by the way was a better book than a movie  did crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look . 
i just caught the end . 
what do you think ? 
i do n't like the title .  or the main guy 's name . 
depends who pays ? 
definitely not martin .  movie stars never pick up the check .  they have no idea what things cost .  most of them do n't know their zip code and a lot do n't even know their own phone number . 
oh i like him .  i just think he 's .  .  .  short .  i mean he 's a good actor and all but i 'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in marty . 
yeah .  there 's a girl in it now . 
hey chili ?  look at me . 
you do n't act like it ? 
could n't find my toothbrush . 
all i know is he came by the barber shop all fuckin' undone wanting to know where you were staying in vegas .  i told him i do n't know .  i still do n't . 
what 're you talking about ?  you wanna be a movie star ? 
what emotion' ?  girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick . 
come on in . 
i do n't hear anything . 
chili and me . 
hello martin . 
really . 
yeah and i 'm wondering how did it go wrong ?  how did it all .  .  .  slip away ? 
and after all you have such morals . 
affirmative arctic warrior .  what type of vessel ? 
amidships starboard at the beam .  just under the waterline .  i do n't think it 's a problem . 
why not . 
maureen ? 
roger ? 
out here ?  what so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now ? 
what 're you crazy ? 
maybe he is n't alone . 
right .  wednesday . 
why not ? 
smugglers maybe . 
we gotta get outa here dodge .  a storm blows up and we 're history . 
a ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard adrift ?  and nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it ? 
then we 're rich .  we 're damn filthy stinking rich . 
the sooner we get under way the sooner we are to spending what 's ours . 
how do you mean ? 
what ?  ! 
conveniently enough for you . 
maybe twenty gallons an hour . 
too big .  more like a freighter . 
that 's what i call a payday . 
you just shoot at something ? 
if they were close enough to shore they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats . 
february first . 
the what ? 
i do n't know what else you 'd call her .  one second she was there the next she was gone . 
showing you what ? 
no .  i think they are were just passengers .  innocent victims . 
victims of what ? 
more than just a mutiny .  more than just the gold . 
just lucky i guess . 
if the weather holds it might not be so bad . 
so you killed them ? 
i did n't want it to turn out this way . 
murphy do n't you see what 's happening ? 
i think i see it pretty well . 
i know a little bit about human nature and what i 've seen only confirms that . 
i think maybe you been on this boat a little too long with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo .  there 's nothing supernatural about greed .  and that 's what it comes down to pure and simple . 
you 're up late . 
you do n't remember ? 
better late than never . 
twenty .  you knock off twenty and then we see .  after my guy looks at it . 
how should i know ? 
yup . 
well maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at computer station .  normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience but she thinks she can convince them . 
i 'm afraid i do n't understand .  i simply wish to know 
no i 'm serious .  give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell . 
oh my god that 's him ! 
can i come in ? 
are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms ? 
nothing . 
it 's just my stupid way of getting attention !  god i practically love you josh ! 
why not ? 
these assholes are saying that i have to go to summer school and take some stupid art class ! 
uh oh .  .  .  do n't turn around .  .  . 
in fact never . 
god this paper is so boring .  who reads all this shit ?   here we go .  .  .   windsurfing doctor mensan iq maverick sagittarius .  let 's hit the clubs make each other laugh ! 
is n't it weird ?  it 's her favorite . 
i remember every minute of that party . 
i bet !  actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with  you always go for guys with some lame fake shtick . 
that larry guy  what look was he going for ?  a gay tennis player from the forties ? 
which loser ? 
why do i always have to do it ? 
i remember when i first started reading these i thought dwf stood for dwarf ! 
what exactly is a cardigan anyway ? 
i ca n't believe it ! 
i know .  .  .  would n't you be totally pissed off ? 
he wo n't see us .  .  .  we 'll just stalk him from a distance . 
bingo ! 
not really .  .  . 
somewhere downtown . 
fuck you bitch ! 
hassle ? 
it 's not like i 'm some modern punk dickhead .  .  .  it 's obviously supposed to be a 1977 punk look but i guess johnny fuckface is too stupid to get it ! 
everybody 's too stupid ! 
god are n't you tired of seymour yet ? 
aw c 'mon this is a fun party . 
no way .  .  .  when ? 
really ?  both of you ?  .  .  .  why not ? 
well we wo n't keep you . 
it 's kind of falling apart . 
fine and how are you ? 
tsk !  you jews are so clever with money .  .  . 
fuck you you stupid redneck hick ! 
you know like weird 1960 's indian rock n' roll music . 
wow ! 
no !  !  ! 
i .  .  .  i did n't think you would have any interest in this get together .  .  .  i mean if you had told me you were coming i would have warned you  it 's not like a real party or anything . 
really ?  can i see it ? 
i do n't know what kind of question is that ?  i mean it 's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me .  .  . 
i really did n't get a good look at her . 
i mean as long as she 's not a complete imbecile and she 's even remotely attractive .  .  . 
oh my god !  we have to go in here ! 
we 'll just go in for one minute  it 'll be a riot ! 
shh ! 
i told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label . 
hooray for me . 
yeah right i 'm a klansman  thanks a lot !  .  .  .  do you know the cook 's chicken franchise ? 
yeah but still .  .  . 
do n't you trust me seymour ? 
oh .  .  .  uh thanks a lot enid .  .  .  i really appreciate it .  .  . 
uh yeah .  a long time ago .  .  .  she called before once .  .  .  it 's just somebody trying to humiliate me . 
yaaa ! 
so what kind of stuff do you guys do together ?  is she into old records and stuff ? 
are n't you even going to ask me how i 'm doing ? 
just someone so young .  .  . 
you must have done something to make her think you like me . 
i .  .  .  i do n't think so . 
no of course not . 
 .  .  . what do you mean ? 
look i just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then i 'll leave you alone . 
what 's the matter ? 
do you have anything to drink ? 
fuck dana .  i 'm sick of dana . 
jesus how can you stand her ? 
that 's great !  halfempty  that 's what i like about you seymour you 're a natural pessimist ! 
what are you talking about ?  you 're disappointed every minute of your life . 
i mean .  .  .  of course i .  .  .  why would n't i want to go out with you ? 
 .  .  . maybe i should just move in here with you .  .  .  i could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until i get a job . 
i was just thinking out loud .  .  .   i mean you 've got this whole thing with dana  i 'm not going to let you fuck that up .  .  . 
shhh .  .  .  i really need to get some sleep . 
they 're seymour 's . 
yeah well .  .  .  thanks for cheering me up . 
i wish i could see him . 
i did n't conceive of it for the lions i built one in india when there was trouble with a tiger . 
i 'm going to try and locate redbeard i assume you 've heard of him . 
well he got away did n't he ?   riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them donkey took the brunt of it then suddenly the lion ran off . 
what if there are complications ? 
we have hunted since childhood . 
might be exciting for you . 
possibly . 
but you said they were always old . 
but it 's crazy the lion should n't be that hungry this soon .   samuel ? 
we need to talk . 
let me save time  you are the engineer  you are in charge  you 're sorry i 'm here .  right so far ?   good because  i am not an engineer  i do n't want to be in charge and  i 'm sorrier than you are that i 'm here i hate tsavo .  so i will help you by killing the lions and leaving and you will help me by doing what i tell you so i can leave .  see any problems ? 
all right let 's go into battle .   i 'm redbeard .  
i 'm always considerate my mother taught me that . 
but of course yours worked . 
good luck . 
the most of any lions .  .  .  a hundred .  .  .  ?   probably more .   johnny .  .  .  ? 
actually i could have done it much more easily without you but for whatever reason i 'm glad you came .  
i do actually very much . 
he does n't .  he needs nobody .  but we have hunted many times .  .  .    .  .  . he knows i am afraid of lions .  .  . 
once .  .  .  
four should do it . 
because i have two plans to kill the lions one involving the cattle the other the men . 
i did n't paint it .   i 'm just cleaning it .  it 's an original ver meer .   it 's worth about ten million dollars . 
peter what about the bathtub ? 
so what ?   it 's a free country .   thanks lib . 
no problem .   always glad to help  and hug . 
peter do you think maybe i have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things . 
look you stay away from the mayor .   next fall barring a disaster he 's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with twobit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends .   you read me ? 
so they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services which was a good deal for all of them because then they did n't have to withhold tax and social security which i 'm not saying is right but it 's just a story so i guess it 's all right .   i can finish this later if you 're tired . 

not .   do n't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities .  we 'll be back . 
i await the word of vigo . 
maybe they just want to appeal . 
get on with it counselor ! 
sherman i 've done lots of favors for you . 
i got you out of those bad tax shelters . 
hi it 's really great to meet you guys .   i know this sounds weird but once i had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed but i knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that 
i let them handle all the little stuff .   i just come in on the big ones . 
well i think it 's important for people to know that the world is in danger . 
well for your sake i hope you 're right .   but i think my other guest may disagree with you .  elaine you had another date in mind ? 
you need the exercise . 
it 's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country . 
from where  neptune ? 
you might want to check those duke university mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis . 
this is about as deep as you can go under manhattan without digging your own hole . 
you 're not sleeping with this stuff are you ? 
she 's new in town . 
are you all right ?   you coming down with something ? 
look zeddemore it was n't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line . 
i 've lived in new york all my life and i never visited the statue of liberty .   now i finally get here and we 're taking her out for a walk . 
wonder what ? 
if she 's naked under that toga .   she 's french you know . 
it 's okay .   i have my senior lifesaving card . 
i did n't break your precious clock roy ! 
it is a star !   that 's great .   you 're very good . 
no .   they 're just coming to me . 
do you think i have it dr .  venkman ? 
i got the twister game for later  .  .  . 
spengler  see if you can find the word zuul in any of the literature .   i 'll take miss barrett home and check out her apartment . 
yeah but it 's got a great cello break . 
no ?   what do i act like ? 
okay okay .   but if anything else happens you have to promise you 'll call me . 
i 'll cancel the reservation  i found the name zuul in  .  .  .   the roylance guide to secret societies and sects .   i do n't suppose you 've  read it . 
take me now . 
i want you inside me . 
there is no dana .   i am zuul . 
fine .   this university will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group 's activities . 
definitely some sort of fighting spaniel i think . 
you volunteered did n't you ?   are n't we paying you for this ? 
yeah but i did n't know you were going to give me electric shocks .   what are you trying to prove ? 
what is it ? 
i do n't think so .   it 's more of that gozer thing .   she says she 's the gatekeeper .   does that make any sense to you ? 
you have to keep him there .   do whatever you have to but do n't let him leave  he could be very dangerous . 
you talked to gozer ? 
or even a race memory stored in the collective unconscious .   and i would n't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either . 
we 'd better adjust our streams . 
what do you mean by seen ? 
looked at with your eyes . 
what do i say ? 
ray i apologize .   i guess my confidence in the regents was misplaced .   they did this to galileo too . 
you 're not going to lose the house .  everybody has three mortgages these days . 
maybe .   but no one ever advertised before . 
this might do  .  .  .  i do n't know  .  .  .  it just seems kind of pricey for a fixerupper do n't you think ?   we 're trying to keep our costs down .   you know how it is when you 're starting a new company . 
do you think it 's wide enough ?   how much ? 
fourteen hundred . 
do you know when that might be ?   we 're on the brink of a very serious cashflow problem . 
sure .   each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back .   no problem . 
i do n't know .   i 'm just guessing . 
do you believe in god ? 
judgement day  .  .  . 
yeah judgement day . 
i 'm tired of being stuck in that wagon . 
i 'm sure i do n't know . 
you 're coming back ? 
send them out ! 
i met with falco and the senators have agreed to call for a truce with the germans . 
commodus .  .  .  he 's a gladiator .  .  .  is he mad ? 
proximo we need to talk about my one third .  .  .  i imagine the betting booths will be doing good business .  and what was the name of that olive oil company ? 
i 've read of it . 
you 're a citizen and a soldier .   not a gladiator . 
why you ? 
that 's what worries me .  .  . 
narcissus !   terrified ?   you ?   the only thing he 's scared of is me . 
yours will do ! 
centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the germans will try one last offensive .   they 've got nothing to lose and it 's so very like them . 
it 's your job as a roman officer to disobey such a summons . 
athenians .  .  . 
who else ?   i 'm the one who runs the estates while you 're here risking everything we have for the glory of rome !   or for the glory of you ! 
i killed too many barbarians . 
condemned ?   are n't i owed a trial before being condemned ? 
that 's one way to look at it . 
as what the galloping gladiator ?  ! '
it 's absolutely not like that !   this is for your own good !   come on get the rest of your armor on ! 
on you !   of course !   you are my bravest fighter  the best fighter i have ever seen ! 
why not ? 
ah .  where ? 
at the zoo . 
the zoo .  they have a pretty good one here do they ? 
 really incredible 
all right then !  yes ! 
 how you  how anyone  could do a thing like that . 
i do n't understand . 
goodbye . 
i have to go back now . 
yes . 
oh no .  he said that . 
all right boys  i think you can get back to your rooms .  i do n't think we 'll have any more of this agitation .  will we braddock ? 
i 'm in the bathroom . 
well here 's the purse . 
oh  yes .  the singleman party . 
a single .  just for myself please . 
what ?  no .  nothing . 
where is your luggage ? 
oh .  well actually i 'd just as soon find it myself .  i just have the toothbrush to carry up and i think i can manage it myself . 
fine thank you .  the bathroom is down at the end of the hall . 
that 's right . 
what ? 
let 's go . 
i want you to come in till i get the lights on . 
because i do n't feel safe until i get the lights on . 
look  i drove you home .  i was glad to do it .  but i have some things on my mind .  can you understand that ? 
no . 
my husband will be back quite late . 
mrs .  robinson  you are trying to seduce me . 
mrs .  robinson will you forgive me for what i just said ? 
no i do n't .  but i just feel a little funny . 
what novel did you read . 
what ? 
what ? 
well i ca n't . 
well i never thought of you and mr .  robinson as the kind of people who .  .  . 
wait a minute .  wait a minute .  so how did it happen ? 
because i 'm interested mrs .  robinson .  now what was your major subject at college ? 
oh no .  in the car you did it ? 
a ford !  a ford !  goddamnit a ford !  that 's great ! 
benjamin do n't you ever take that girl out . 
let 's hear your reasons mrs .  robinson .  because i think i know what they are . 
benjamin ? 
you go to hell .  you go straight to hell mrs .  robinson .  do you think i 'm proud of myself ?  do you think i 'm proud of this ? 
are you ? 
but if it 's sickening for you 
may i stay then ? 
this is absurd . 
look we 'll go out to dinner and have a drink and i 'll bring her back .  because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families .  and i 'm afraid i could n't quite handle that if you do n't mind .  i have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life .  so do n't get upset about it . 
do exactly what i say . 
i 'll find her . 
sir ? 
very good sir . 
yes .  well  goodnight . 
sure . 
benjamin ?  i 'm going to ask you something but you do n't have to tell me if you do n't want . 
what else ? 
i do . 
no . 
we have n't . 
different . 
would you mind telling me then  what were those four years of college for ?  what was the point of all that hard work ? 
no  it 's not .  it 's completely baked .  it 's a decision i 've made . 
sir ? 
yes sir . 
in many ways i feel as though you were my own son . 
oh  not too much .  taking it easy . 
because i just think you two would hit it off real well together . 
it was nothing to do with you sir . 
you miss the point . 
do n't shout at me ben . 
the point is  i do n't love your wife .  i love your daughter sir . 
huh ? 
mrs .  robinson ? 
could i speak to you for a second dad ? 
they are ?   come on . 
your bank mr .  kringelein .

no thanks  keeping my head clear . 
how 's the beautiful lady ? 
my dear sir i would gladly change rooms with you . 
what ?   who ?   whom ? 
i do n't know . 
i do n't believe it  he was a real gentleman .  i know people .  .  .  i 'm so tired i can hardly see out of my eyes .  no sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel  that means a lot of work .  but it 's too bad about the baron you always felt better when he came along  always friendly  such an agreeable fellow . 
nobody doctor . 
the grand hotel .

when a lady falls in love she does her hair differently . 
that theatre  half empty  dancing for those few  i was frantic  i finished  the last beat and .  .  .    .  .  . i waited  i listened  but the applause did n't come  nothing .  a man in the box  and just the claques behind  it is passed pimenov .  we are dead  it 's finished . 
good morning gru  your 
does the world belong to you mr .  preysing ?

no i wo n't wait  i ca n't  every day is precious  every hour  every minute . 
i want to dictate my statement for tomorrow .  i ca n't speak without notes .  i like to have things down before me in black and white . 
what 's bluff ?

she had an engagement in the yellow room at five o 'clock  she was in a hurry .

so here we are ! 
i ca n't take that job !  i mean i mean i ca n't take it right away .  i 'm still recuperating i just dropped in to say hello see everybody 
that 's what we 'll do then .  but i tell you what roy .  before i hire anybody else i 'll ask you one last time .  fair enough ? 
i 'm working down in san diego .  just for a few weeks .   thought i 'd drop in on my longlost son . 
you 're one to talk .  still running playback money for the mob . 
the first day of the delmar meet there was a nag called bluebell .  i should have been on it .  but that was the day after you came in here so i stuck around to see how you were gonna be . 
you do if you 're where i am .  where you want to be .  how 'd you get that punch in the stomach roy ? 
i guess not .  you 'll be heading east from here huh ? 
no . 
i thought it over and you were right .  you wanted me out of the rackets and now 
i thought you 'd be happy for me .  after all you 
i do n't care about that .  this time i gotta have the rent . 
we 'll work something out joe . 
scram .  go home . 
you 're too young .  you should be in school .

oh yeah ?   thanks .   how long do they say i 'm in here ? 
i want to know everything about you . 
i just do what the doctor says babe . 
i do n't like to come here roy .  every time i do your mother comes in and makes remarks . 
that 's just lilly 's way . 
you 're a mama 's boy if you want the truth . 
see you soon . 
the long end .  big con . 
it was beautiful .  and getting better all the time . 
is that right ? 
it is roy !  and now right now it 's the perfect time the best time since i 've been in the game . 
yeah ?  how ? 
that 's where they keep the criminally insane is n't it ? 
sure . 
sure .  i 'm pretty tired myself . 
i saw her . 
you must have some very knowledgeable friends . 
yes or no .  they 're both easier at home .  okay ? 
what ? 
what i say is no .  we do n't do partners . 
mostly because you scare the shit out of me .  i 've seen people like you before baby .  doubletough and sharp as they come and you get what you want or else .  but you do n't make it work forever . 
bullshit ! 
better take em to virgil 's downtown .   we got a dead body in there . 
pretty messy .   parents have already been notified .   our office has been trying to get a hold of you .  .  . 
think eddie had something to do with it ? 
what the fuck are you talking about ? 
i think someone broke into my house . 
no shit ?  ! 
do n't think so .   but they sure did a real number on your office .  crap everywhere . 
i took the padlock off your door .  what more do you want ? 
my life is a living hell . 
nothing . 
or what ?   you 're gonna shoot me ? 
afraid not .   you can pick your friends but you ca n't pick your family . 
where 'd you get it ? 
then i 'll get caught . 
here take my jacket . 
who ?  ! 
the tighter you squeeze the harder he 'll try to break free . 
michael meyers . 
are you going to leave too ? 
i have to pee . 
where 's shane ? 
you mean tommy .   yeah on the weirdness scale he 's about an eleven .   supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid .   messed up his head .   he 's harmless though .   probably just lonely . 
he 's in the bathroom . 
kara and danny never showed up tonight .  we 'd better go home and check on them .  there 's nothing else for us to do here . 
but they 're gonna light the tree in a few minutes 
you 've been watching too much tv . 
promise ? 
i promise . 
kids are what 's ruining this country .  everywhere you go it 's the same .   no goddamn respect . 
i 've come to help your family . 
found this morning .   in a field outside haddonfield .   stabbed . 
an old friend . 
no one 's home .   checked it out myself . 
your madness is another man's greatness .   this is the way things have always been .   you 've just been too blinded by your own reality to see .   but having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways .   you always did come through  our loyal watch dog .  finding him .  bringing him back to us once he 'd finished his work .   although after you had that nasty stroke the last time i had to go after him myself .   and what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell . 
she has the gift  the blood of thorn running through her veins .   michael 's mother had it too .   so for six years i incubated her prepared her for this night .   michael has served his purpose .   and soon we will have a new progeny . 
stay away sam . 
it 's a bitch . 
oh shit . 
you were rich before .   this is the first time i was ever rich . 
so long colonel . 
you know what gets me ? 
go home ! 
the educational process . 
you know me boy . 
when we were up in the tree so longwith the bats . 
every time i start thinking like that i get the clap . 
it helped more than you know .   down deep people were deeply affected . 
i dunno . 
sorry .   at least you 've got a place to come back to .   i do n't have a place to come back to anymore . 
maybe it 's time you got out . 
eight years you guys were together through thick and thin . 
i 'd rather go to viet nam . 
i just want one true adventure before i die . 
that can be arranged . 
for africa . 
it would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us . 
no matter what you say to me i still think you 're the greatest guy i ever knew . 
as a matter of facti am home . 
are youdo you
do you mind if i ask who you are ? 
mind ?   god yes i mind .   i 'm your father 's friend .   a man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago . 
he worships father . 
i see .   and he came into the apartment one day to demonstrate his wares and your mother as it happened was charmingly en deshabille
he insults him all the time . 
no . 
do n't care for cold steel ?   a knife is worse than a bullet ? 
where did you get the poison ? 
the name will live forever .   it was there that harold ryan slew the beast of yugoslavia .   mhravitch . 
you 're a very good boy to respond that way . 
go ahead .   no no no no . 
alive and hale .   he 's throwing a little surprise party for his own family .   is your mother often this unstable ?   penelope ! 
she said you were legendary .   i wrote a theme about you and she said your father is a legendary hero out of the golden age of heroes . 
that 's nice .   you thank her for me .  go to bed and get lots of sleep and then you thank her in the morning . 
what 's this ? 
pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamberwhere it belongs . 
too late !   it 's man to man now .  protecting your mother from me are you ?   protect her ! 
everybody simply evaporates !   there are guest issues to be fought out hereor to be argued at least .  the enemy the champion of all who oppose me is in east st .  louis with his mother and his aunt !   i have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a violin . 
i 'm talking to you gently now . 
how do you do mrs .  ryan ?   i 'd heard you were beautiful and so you are .   am i intruding here ? 
your old beau ? 
we thought it was an emergency . 
when i 'm dead  or fucking . 
i did ? 
a trip you mean ? 
you used to like it stark ! 
i 'm not going to strike you .   i am going to be as gentle as pieas lemon meringue pie .   you must n't run away now .   this is your loving husband approaching .   i 'm your husband .   society approves ! 
you 've killed women ? 
he 's dead you know . 
 .  .  . who ?  .  .  .  did she say how far apart the pains were ?  .  .  .  when was that ?  .  .  .  oh dear . 
oh dear . 
call her backtell her to head for the hospital .   tell the hospital to expect her .   i 'll leave right now . 
ahhthen she 's still alive . 
and what exactly is your relationship to mrs .  ryan ? 
pacqualinincheewa root .   means cougar fang .  cures anything but a yellow streak down the back . 
we have have we ? 
you were wrong you quack ! 
a living fossil !   like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs . 
i 'm to be left behindin primordial ooze ? 
do n't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew ? 
i put a poisoned thought in your head .   even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind .   it 's saying obsolete obsolete obsolete and clown clown clown . 
and the hell with it .   it was so tragically irrelevant so preposterously misinformed . 
my selfrespect is goneand my soldier 's honor with it .   it is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man . 
use the sanitary facilities if i may . 
it was a bitch . 
thank you .   you can leave now .   we 'll begin . 
so that 's it !  kestenbaum kestenbaum .  everybody was yelling kestenbaum kestenbaum .  i thought it was some foreign language . 
alice is dead ? 
how horrible . 
i dunno .   marry the first whore who 's nice to me i guess .   get a job in a motorcycle shop .   so long you guys . 
you want to join the harold ryan fan club ?   wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back ? 
that is sad . 
is it ?   i have this theory about why men kill each other and break things . 
do n't ! 
you sure misunderstood something and we 'd better get it straight . 
no . 
you 're the only woman he ever took out . 
father 's friend . 
do n't know . 
what does he say to do ? 
maybe it 's supposed to end now .  maybe god would n't have it any other way . 
i 'll get ready herb .   i did n't expect you this soon .   pleasewo n't everybody be nice to everybody else while i 'm gone ? 
i 'm glad . 
i know . 
i do n't want to go to vanderbilt . 
when harold is definitely out of the picture penelope when i do n't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or paul wrong .   i 'm going to ask you to be my wife . 
it 's dark in there .  penelope and that 's where he is ! 
a week .   we were waiting for the right time to
thank you herb .   you 're a wonderful man .   you really are .  everybody respects you for what you 've done for scouting and the little league . 
what 's so wonderful if i lost the sale ?   you poor kid . 
wellit was nice while it lasted .  thanks for the memories . 
if he has anything to say about it yeah .  i 've been asking a lot of questions and i do n't like the answers i 'm getting .  he 's made a lot of people nervous including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star . 
no i do n't . 
what do you mean ? 
wait ? 
how many weeks ? 
just one . 
that 's charity .  she 's out back .  she 'll be free in half hour . 
i tried to get more but this is the limit .  the de vries line has the same area . 
pavonine .  it 's the same tint as the stripe in the fabric . 
sam ? 
yeah . 
make it nine hundred .  that was my best week . 
at least i 'm a growing person . 
you never met a working girl before have you ?  you think i like sucking off guys all night ?  maybe i do .  so what ?   you ca n't even say it can you ?

well then i must be off .   we shall have to meet again . 
yes . 
and you get into any car you want and just drive off ? 
all right . 
she seemed yare to me . 
that 's really great . 
what ? 
an ice sculpture .  it 's venus  the goddess of love the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream . 
look the ice is melting . 
did confucius say that ? 
no .  i feel more like  yodeling . 
they 're going to draft me .  in the army .  i 'm going to be sent away . 
well do n't go . 
yes . 
they mocked me .  they were representations of people i dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me and that in time all i would have left would be vague feelings  but sharp photographs !  so i tossed them out .  my memory fades i know .  but i prefer pictures made by me with feeling and not by kodak with silver nitrate . 
i do n't know . 
huh ?

oh now you 're defending that motherfucker ?   you 're going soft in your old age rob .   there was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street .   now all of a sudden i 'm offending your golf buddy .   you 're right rob .   i am so sorry .  how are we ever going to make enough money to get you and laura into the country club ? 
just listen to me .   if i said to you 
how the fuck am i supposed to know that ?   you might get sick of people telling you you 've really gotta go see the movie . 
because it 's a brilliant film .   it 's funny violent and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass . 
how do you know about that ? 
i did n't make up the name .   it 's the steely dan song .   and it was in the commitments . 
that was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally yes .  but 
great !   that 's fucking great !   they only asked you to sing because of your name !   you can stick it above the browser racks over there . 
of course i 'm not coming .   do i look like i 'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave ?   where is it ?   the fucking bucktown pub ?   ha ! 
whatever .   okay .  tell laura i love her .  that 'd bring the house down .  laura 's mom could sing it . 
because it 's in the big chill . 
yes way .   it 's really .  .  . 
we 're not as bad as you think rob . 
no ! 
oh well .   nevermind . 
is n't her album called number four with a smile ? 
it 's a reference to a chinese meal in toronto and i think that there is a the .   but i could be wrong . 
we work there ! 
he 's not worth it ! 
 it was dean you fucking idiot . 
well i used to go to the dodger on your nights and i saw you 're doing it again and that your putting out a record and it 's sort of a thenand now story against the backdrop of the chicago music scene with the emphasis on now . 
yeah .   i could show it to you if you want to come over and see it . 
your desert island topfive .

why did you break up with me for marco ? 
c 'mon just answer the question .  you can say what you like .   what the hell ? 
good weekend ? 
yeah i have n't really absorbed that one . 
okay . 
'course i will rob .   no problem .  no problem at all .   i 'll tell him next time i see him . 
i 'll start with your news before i tell him mine obviously .   mine is n't much really just about marie lasalle  playing at lounge ax tonight .   i like her you know she 's kind of sheryl crowish .  .  .  but you know good .   so i 'll tell him before that .  good news and bad news kind of thing . 
liz hold on a second   what ? 
marie lasalle is in the store !   here she 's here and now ! 
 fuck off ! 
i 'm upset but i 'm fine . 
yeah . 
i thought i could give you a lift back . 
i remember the song .   i just could n't remember who sang it . 
so you were n't interested in music at all ? 
you 're being deliberately obtuse . 
hey how ya doin' ? 
pigsty . 
do n't worry about it .   just get into bed .   worry about that when you 're better . 
no no .   when are you going home ? 
you 're also an idiot . 
thank you .   i appreciate it .   i ca n't reciprocate . 
c 'mon . 
i 've only got a couple left .   i 'm saving them for later . 
i lived with you .   you were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you 're worried i might kill you and you 're entitled to worry .   is n't that a terrible thing ?   is n't that sad ? 
hey great idea .   what i 'll do is tomorrow i 'll get a hold of a box full of mint elvis presley 78s on the sub label and i 'll pay for it that way . 
well you were the kind of person who came to the artful dodger and i was the kind of person who deejayed at the artful dodger .   you wore jeans and tshirts and so did i .   and i still do and you do n't . 
no but .  .  . 
you have n't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years i 've known you .   if we 've grown apart then i 'm the one who 's done the growing and all i 've done is change jobs . 
harder . 
where ? 
ha . 
what ? 
you had no right .   supposing i was doing something that could n't be cancelled ? 
no .   i do n't think so .   i 'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days .  fair enough ? 
i 'm just sick of thinking about it all the time . 
well you 've asked . 
actually i 'm fine .   i 'm great .  last night i got to thinking you know what ?   maybe it is time to move on .   maybe we 're just not right for each other .   or maybe we are .   but time will tell and at this point i 'm going to be fine with whatever 's meant to be .  you know ? 
rob !   two years ago you got laura pregnant you then proceeded to cheat on her !   you borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back !   and then just a few weeks ago you told her you were unhappy with her and were kind of looking around for somebody else ! 
well she 
what difference does it make ? 
yup .   not far from here actually . 
it 's a great song . 
i 'm sure it is n't . 
whiskey . 
so you 'll stay ? 
meet a nice girl and have children .  i promise the next time we talk i 'll have it all sorted out . 
so you say .   i 'd like to hear her side of it . 
mom !   for the last fucking time i 'm telling you laura did n't want to get married !   she is not that kind of girl !   to use a phrase .   that 's not what happens now . 
give me fifty bucks and they 're all yours . 
and you must not be getting along too well right now huh ? 
suit yourself .   there are plenty of others who will . 
thirteen hundred . 
sure .   ten cents . 
okay .   because you took the trouble to come up here .   and because you 've got principles .   but that 's it .   i 'm not selling them to you one by one . 
we 're not there yet justin . 
this one came unassembled . 
fine . 
scottish claymore .   take a french epee add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business and you 've got a claymore . 
you 're very macabre . 
thanks . 
carl smith . 
very traditional . 
no .   just the child of some lonely girl i gave a ride to .   when they died i put them in a grave with my name on it .  twenty years later i became the son . 
a factor of age . 
you wo n't . 
my life has been chock full of people with complications and weak nesses .   i ca n't stand it .   but you 're different .   it 's in your hands .   a clarity . 
i 'd like you to try . 
what about that family in '31 ? 
life is only life when it is bounded by death .   the inheritance is death .  the gift is the finality of life .  to be part of the fabric .   the inside .   i love you brenna . 
now there 's a new topic . 
you 've been a busy little beaver .  especially with that records mess up in church hill .   your notes are very complete .  naturally my feelings were crushed when you did n't rush right over and tell us what you knew .   in fact we 're considering book ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder . 
it 'll never stick . 
research .   if your pal was there i never saw him . 
it 's that important ? 
your name is conor ? 
i should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation .   and a solution . 
how can you know this ? 
does it change with me in the room ? 
i do n't understand . 
you are not dead boy .   accept it . 
oh my god .   oh my god i 'm lost . 
aye . 
we are brothers .   and you are a defense  of sorts . 
me arm hurts . 
go to hell . 
oh the boy has a mouth now if only he had an arm . 
point conceeded mr .  macleod . 
some think not . 
what would you like ? 
like you . 
perhaps not .   you seem to have misplaced a private .   no doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck . 
romirez is dust . 
we need more time . 
you are really going to force this are n't you ? 
but ian he 's still but a boy . 
what 's the point !   you have me finish it !

if anybody had told me i 'd be sitting at lunch with him  but he swept me right off my feet . 
and what 's the matter with a thousand dollars ? 
i know a lot of men who did n't do anything till they met walter burns .  please dear .

yeah in this book there 's a chapter called self made freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show .  it mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of borneo and shit like that but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an armless wonder . 
yeah so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree ? 
you know what jerry who really cares at this point ?

i do n't know nathan .  what are you supposed to do ? 
no !  it is now that you must decide .   i love you doctor nathan .  .  .    .  .  . but i will not wait .  i will not be your chippy .  i will not be your little mademoiselle parlezvous side dish .   my love .  i want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly .  .  .  from you . 
it 's an animal urge puff .  it 's nothing to be ashamed of . 
very well .

oh yes honey .  getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over .  smooth as a baby 's butt . 
i love it rose .  i 'm getting to be a real girl . 
yeah well my brother is his shrink . 
my brother says he likes you too . 
marrying a midget was a cheap thrill ? 
i love that you said that .  it makes me feel a bit lighter .  i 've been rather heavy lately .  thinking about my childhood .  realizing how much a product i am of my upbringing .   i 've been seeing someone .  a therapist . 
paper or cloth ? 
what 's the larger experiment ? 
oh i 'm sorry .   i 'm sorry nathan .  i never really learned those things . 
i 'm sorry that i became so upset .

it would be my pleasure doctor .   distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community i stand before you today a living testament to the amazing skill of dr .  nathan bronfman .  to say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement .  dr .  bronfman took me from playing with my own feces then to crayons and then to an appreciation of the complex works of franz kline joseph beuys and marcel duchamp .  from compulsive masturbation to .  .  . 
look why do n't you and lila stay here and have your natural life .  i 'll just go on my way .  you 'll never see me again .

i thought you said you were doing to break it off . 
just what the hell do you think you 're doing ?

so far these things have not become hostile .  for the moment let 's assume they wo n't .   connie let 's issue statements advising people not to panic to stay home and take cover . 
if we do n't strike soon there may not be much of an america left to defend . 
i 'm going after dad .

why 'd you invite me here ? 
i do n't know . 
 .  .  . mr .  athol will be with you as soon as possible .  will you be able to wait ? 
the experiment .  the danger .  .  . 
what does he know ? 
yeah ?  what for ? 
pooh 's dusty sweetheart .  .  .  he 's dusty and you breathed him in okay ?  so what 's  what 's happening to you now is .  .  .  cells called mast cells told your lungs do n't breathe any more of that dust in .    .  .  . and the airways in your lungs are like branches .  and when the branches close up you get an asthmatic attack .  and we give you medicine and you get better .  huh ?  okay ?  you 're better already are n't you ? 
can i go over to janeane 's house ? 
i heard them . 
you bet we are .  and i ca n't talk to you now . 
monday . 
it 's drawn from a selectively circulated .  .  . 
because he has to reveal it in a court of law .  it 's on record it 's out .  it 's no secret anymore .  so how can they restrain his speech or retaliate ?  it 's out in the world .  .  . 
oh we need cops on the street .  we do n't need them on horses . 
excuse me lowell .  sharon's on line 3 . 
it 's an alternate version .  so what if we have an alternate version ?  and i do n't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable . 
no .   i 'm assuming the cavein begins with the threat of litigation from big tobacco .  are we talking .  .  .  are we talking brown  williamson here ? 
do n't you have to be at the office ? 
i 'm going to the store .  you need anything ? 
soy sauce .  .  . 
i do n't understand . 
why ?  who said ? 
can we talk about this when i get back ? 
i ca n't .  .  .  i 've got to fly to boston tomorrow . 
from my perspective what 's been going on and what i 've been doing is ridiculous .  it 's halfmeasures . 
who is this ? 
area code 2125550199 . 
what chance is there of getting jeff 's interview on the air .  .  .  ? 
bring a tie so they 'll let us in the front door .  .  . 
the seven ceos of big tobacco .  .  .  referred to this .  .  .  said they should be afraid of him .  .  .  i assume afraid of what he could reveal .   now you tell me .  what does this guy have to say that threatens these people ? 
how are the rooms ?  comfortable ? 
i 'm with don on this . 
i think it was a disgrace . 
i 'm going to tell you why .  because when i tell someone i 'm going to do something i deliver . 
in the real world when you get to where i am there are other considerations .  .  . 
how have you liked your stay ? 
because i think hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now .  so you care about what you 're thought of in america .  and in america at this moment in time hezbollah does not have a face .   that 's why . 
no .  we do n't do that .   you 've seen 60 minutes and mike wallace .  so you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity .  you also know we are the highestrated mostrespected tvmagazine news show in america . 
that 's good .  that works .   uh you know i want to ask you something .  .  .  i know it sounds odd .  .  .  but .  .  . 
what are you talking about ?  where are you ? 
like what ? 
then .  .  .  you 're in a state of conflict jeff . 
my father ?  what the hell 's that got to do with my father ? 
 .  .  . to a network probably we 're all commodities .   to me ?  you are not a commodity .  what you are is important . 
i ca n't say that ! 
what do you mean followed you ?  did you call the police ? 
well what do you really think though ? 
there is  there is no family . 
i 'd rather play than talk about it .   what did you want to see me about ?  i do n't like being back here . 
yeah i know you do .  .  .   you know i came up through sales .  one of the reasons i was a great salesman was i never made a promise i could n't keep .   i knew that if i ever broke my promise i 'd suffer the consequence .  .  . 
okay .   i do n't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements .  i was paid well for my work .  the health and welfare benefits are good .  the severance package is fair .  i have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which i said i would n't . 
after you doll . 
is that .  .  .  one person ? 
triple ! 
grounds ? 
you want botox ? 
it was a gift from a client . 
got any symptoms ? 
yes .  the inability to experience pleasure . 
the center counter defense .  the thing is not to move your queen too early . 
marylin rexroth .  she came into my office and signed a prenup with howard doyle . 
that was  oh shit .  what if he 's on his way over there ? 
why do you think she did it ? 
it 's about time . 
i think ming is older than tong .   what is this ? 
i 'll be right back . 
is n't everything ? 
yes .  again . 
i know . 
i have a watch . 
oh miles ! 
may i come in ? 
i do n't believe you have things . 
on the contrary .  we 're married and we have no prenup so a case could be made that everything in here is mine . 
you 're out of your league marylin .  rexroth was a primate .  i 'm a professional . 
that 's marriage . 
marylin ? 
miles ?  miles !  where have you been ?  i 've been trying to get in touch . 
so did i .  now pack up a few basics and 
fine .  they were created during a dictatorship .   what if something happened to you ?  what would i tell little gus when he asked what was my daddy like ? 
i thought so . 
please ! 
he told me to  he said he wanted me to 
oh god ! 
yes yes it 's just  you know i 've never been the first wife .  rex was married before me . 
she 's here now . 
at this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation . 
that 's delusional . 
my client feels sufficiently dispassionate . 
i 'll have you suspended .  i 'll have you disbarred . 
miles massey .  please sit relax and consider this office your office your haven your war room  for the duration of the campaign . 
mm . 
i do n't know .  i can assume .  .  . 
and she had private investigators assisting her . 
she brought my digestive enzymes . 
and she has .  .  .  ? 
berry spoons . 
she could buy and sell you ten times over . 
kenneth this is my associate wrigley .  wrigley this is my friend dr .  beck . 
do you have it ? 
please understand me .  when i say she did n't tell me anything about it i mean not until a little while ago .  she thinks you 're entitled to anything you can get . 
and this is what you wantthirty nine dollars and sixty cents ? 
let me get this straight .  you want this thirtynine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars ? 
what ten thousand ? 
i 'm afraid i 'm a little confused .  you see i assumed you were coming here for
the average man would go after the reward .  all you seem to
a guy that 'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined . 
do you love her ? 
i asked you a question .  do you love her ? 
i might . 
please .  i ca n't fight on an empty stomach .  remember what napoleon said . 
i hope you 're not comparing yourself to napoleon .  he was a strategist .  your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe . 
you 're going to finance him i suppose . 
why not ?   look what he 's doing for aviation .  it takes courage to do what he does .  and character !  at least he 's accomplished something worthwhile .  i suppose you 'd like to have me marry a business man .  well i hate business menparticularly if you 're a shining example . 
ah !  coconut layer cake .  nice and gooey too .  just the way i like it . 
oh yes .  i heard . 
nothing .  
no . 
he 's marvelous ! 
yes .  peter warne . 
i suppose so . 
certainly !   pay him off .  he 's entitled to it .  he did an excellent job .  kept me thoroughly entertained .  it 's worth every penny he gets . 
why should she ?  after all
what about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that ? 
fine .  i 'll see you at the reception . 
oh no .  she 'll be crazy about it .  well see you later .  i 'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space .   goodbye .  
what do they say ? 
just between you and me i never intended taking it off . 
holy smokes !  you 'll never get out yourself !  better phone for some help . 
wellof all thewell  maybe you 'll be interested to know your bag 's gone . 
no i 've got that all right .  but my money .  all i have here is four dollars .  i 've got to get to new york with it . 
why noi  yes  .   .   .  i guess i will . 
no .  i 'd rather you did n't . 
why that 's ridiculous !  they 're responsible for everything that
why you ungrateful brat ! 
i hated to wake you up .   how about some breakfast ? 
what are you talking about ? 
will you please tell me what you 're raving about ! 
what for ? 
listen if you 'll promise not to do it i 'll pay you .  i 'll pay you as much as he will .  you wo n't gain anything by giving me away as long as i 'm willing to make it worth your while .  i 've got to get to new york without being stopped .  it 's terribly important to me .  i 'd pay now only the only thing i had when i jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and i had to pawn that to get these clothes .  i 'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to new york . 
forget it .  i did n't do it for you .  his voice got on my nerves . 
now is n't that just too cute ?  there 's a brain behind that face of yours is n't there ?  you 've got everything nicely figured out for yourself including this . 
smart aleck ! 
peter warne ?  i do n't like it . 
listen brati 'm going to count to ten .  if you 're not out of bed by then i 'm going to yank you out myself . 
like this .  i have no robe . 
your hair 's cute like that .  you should never comb it . 
if you did n't waste so much time on that wisecracking drummerwe 'd have been through with breakfast by this time . 
why you do n't have to apologize mr .  warne .  you 'll never know how much i appreciate all this . 
thanks .   you think this whole business is silly do n't you ?  i mean running away and everything . 
thanks .  nurses governesses chaperones even bodyguards .  oh it 's been a lot of fun . 
it has its moments .  it got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father 's detectives .  ii did it once actually went shopping without a bodyguard .  it was swell .  i felt absolutely immoral .  but it did n't last long .  they caught up with me in a department store .  i was so mad i ran out the back way and jumped into the first car i saw .  guess who was in it ? 
there you go again !  how many times did i tell you to stop butting in when i have an argument ? 
he did n't make a pass at me !  i told you a million times ! 
well you were ! 
we could start a twoperson stock company .  if things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums .  we 'll call this one the great deception . 8
i did !  it was my idea was n't it ? 
do n't be silly .  nothing you can do .  must be tough on an old womana trip like this . 
at the rate he started he 's probably passed two state lines by this time .  the exercise is good for him . 
i do n't trust that chatterbox . 
to new york ? 
sorry .   it 's the first time i 've ridden piggyback in years . 
that 's silly . 
and rich people have none of those qualifications i suppose . 
yeah .  he finally agreed to let us have a room . 
i do n't care .  i love you .  nothing else matters .  we can run away .  everything 'll take care of itself .   please peter .  you ca n't go out of my life now .  i could n't live without you .   oh peter
come here you little fool ! 
not interested .  
you bet we did . 
left twenty minutes ago . 
oh thank you .  thank you very much .   here . 
husband ? 
no he ai n't !  and the car 's gone too . 
what 's that ? 
up yonder .  see the lights ? 
would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you ? 
well i got it joe . 
you ! 
for heaven's sake joestop being an editor for just a minute .   we 've been friends for a long time have n't we ?  you ought to know when i 'm serious .  this is on the level . 
oh boy !  what a yarn !  what a yarn !   get me hank on the phone .  gotta hold up the morning edition . 
yeah but i got a bag .  my wife gave me one for christmas . 
yeah . 
yeah .  come oncome on ! 
take that story there for instance .  be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers . 
you 're not kidnapping her are you ? 
what 's the matter with you !  gettin' yellow ? 
you can trust me mister .  i 'll keep my mouth shut . 
got a couple of kids huh ? 
you love them do n't you ? 
suresurei 'll keep my trap shut .  you can depend on me mister . 
my instinct is that ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating and we 'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks .   if we call him now he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we 've ever had . 
i 've seen him copying files leaving here late at night . 
now that 's pretty important dean .  you also told the fbi when you met him he was six foot two .   then you tell the commission he was five foot eight .   how the hell did the man shrink like that dean ? 
you ca n't ever say crime do n't pay in louisiana jim  only not as good as it used to .   good chowder ai n't it ? 
oh i first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56 '57 when i lived down in the quarter . 
swishes .   they swish y 'know .   young fags you know .   they 'd come into my bureau needing help no bread and i 'd say hey man i ai n't rockefeller who gonna back you up ?   these cornmuffins go to the phone and dial .  .  . 
did you speak to oswald in dallas ? 
a bullshit president !   i do n't see any weeping for all the thousands of cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the bay of pigs .  where are all the tears for the russians and hungarians and chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by kennedy 's communist buddies  all these damned peace treaties !  i 'm telling ya jack that 's what happens when you let the niggers vote .   they get together with the jews and the catholics and elect an irish bleeding heart . 
i think we should have him in for a little talk . 
boss are you calling the president a murderer ? 
 .  .  . did you ever use the alias clay bertrand ? 
dave do you think we 're out of our minds ?   the whole building 's been a zoo since that broke .   we ca n't get a thing done .   reporters crawling everywhere .   you think we want that ? 
it leads farther than that . 
do you remember me mr .  garrison ?   i met you on carondolet street right after your election .   i congratulated you remember ? 
that 's not true .   i never met anybody named oswald .   anybody who told you that has to be crazy . 
but you are aware he served in your civil air patrol unit when he was a teenager . 
i 'm sure you 've seen this .   perhaps you knew this man under another name ? 
did you bag any geese on this trip ? 
your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car .   dave is n't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun ? 
would you say this leon was actually lee harvey oswald ? 
i do n't know .   were you ?   who you scared of dave ? 
everybody !   the agency .   the mob .  the cubans .   yeah follow the cubans .  check them out .   here in dallas miami .   check out a guy named eladio del valle .   my paymaster when i flew missions into cuba  he 's somewhere in miami .   you 're on the right track . 
fuckin' a .   how do you think the agency gets people to do their bullshit ?   fuck knows what they got on oswald ! 
dave can i just ask you this directly ?   did you ever work for the cia ? 
and shaw ? 
as a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death was it not ? 
well i heard dr .  humes stating that  he said .  .  . 
what ? 
well it looks like it jasper . 
no jasper nobody 's gonna kill us . 
four to six . 
sort of like benedict arnold coming back to george washington's cabinet . 
a perry russo ? 
a willie o 'keefe ? 
mr .  o 'keefe told us he met you at the masquerade bar down in the quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on dauphine street .   do you recall that ? 
i would imagine a uniformed waiter helps . 
mr .  shaw have you ever been a contract agent with the central intelligence agency ? 
no people like you do n't have to i guess  people like you walk between the raindrops . 
that 's what bothers me mr .  garrison .  you see they 've been altered .   my statements .  .  . 
honey in all my years in the service i never knew a single man who was given a russian test .   oswald was a radar operator .   he 'd have about as much use for russian as a cat has for pajamas . 
but why in the lord 's name would you do it in the middle of easter sunday when you knew we were .  .  . 
my sympathies . 
liz i 'm really sorry .   the meeting went much longer than expected . 
we waited for you .  .  .  hours jim .  you could have telephoned for god 's sake .   it 's easter !   you promised jim . 
leave us alone for god 's sake !    .  .  . oh it 's lou . 
your daughter 's life was just threatened ! 
how do you know ?   how do you even know what goes on in this house anymore !   you 're too busy making speeches stirring up every crazed klansman in louisiana after us ! 
how many men ? 
earle cabell .   and guess who his brother is ? 
general charles cabell .   deputy director of the cia .   fired by kennedy in '61 because of the bay of pigs fiasco he moved back to the pentagon called kennedy a traitor .   when he came to new orleans to address the foreign policy association you know who introduced him ?   our friend clay shaw . 
head of the cia since '53 .   kennedy fired them both .   cabell was his deputy for nine years .   talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop .   now we 'll have to subpoena them lou . 
boss then i 'm afraid i ca n't continue working with bill . 
i sometimes feel things 've gone downhill since john kennedy was killed senator . 
sure three experts and not one of them could do it !   they 're telling us oswald got off three shots with worldclass precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds  and accordin' to his marine buddies he got maggie 's drawers  he was n't any good .   average man would be lucky to get two shots off and i tell ya the first shot would always be the best .   here the third shot 's perfect .   do n't make sense .   and then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits kennedy and connally seven times .  one pristine bullet ?   that dog do n't hunt . 
you think there were other men involved russell ? 
no it ca n't ! 
you did n't get that break you needed but you went as far as any man could bubba .   what can i do for you ? 
his name ? 
clay bertrand .   he 's in the warren report .   he tried to get oswald a lawyer .   was kennedy ever discussed jack ? 
if you must know virtually nothing . 
how many men are working with you on this ? 
virginia or elizabeth ? 
i am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing  i am going to have some lunch . 
i understand . 
wo n't forget ? 
who ? 
i 'm still scared as a motherfucker ordell .  they talkin' like they serious bout me doin' that machine gun time . 
how old is that machine gun shit ? 
well it ai n't so much a problem a a situation .  remember i sold those three m60 machine guns outta the five i got ? 
well if you owe me git your ass in the trunk . 
but the only way to help you was to do that so i did it .   okay how bout this ?  after we 're through fuckin' with these koreans i take you to roscoe 's chicken and waffles .  my treat . 
she knows it 's my case ? 
sure . 
oh you 're both ?  in 1985 you were flying for twa and got busted for carrying drugs .  you were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours .  he did time and you got off .  but that ended your career with the big airlines .  cut to thirteen years later .  you 're fortyfour years of age .  you 're flying for the shittiest little shuttlefucking piece of shit mexican airline that there is .  where you make a whopping twelvethousand dollars a year .  that ai n't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career .  and to top it off you 're going to jail .  now true the judge even with your prior will probably only give you a year or two .  but this does n't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away .   now we do n't like trying losers like they 're criminals .  but in the absence of a criminal we will try you .  now was n't this money given to you by an american living in mexico by the name of cedric walker ? 
i felt a lot safer having it .  my milk went bad when i was in jail . 
you went out this morning and bought a gun ? 
yeah . 
sure . 
he called you ? 
okay i 'm a little sensitive about my hair .  it started falling out ten years ago .  so i did something about it . 
how 'd you feel about it ? 
how was it ? 
for now .  these relationships never last too long . 
how old 's annette ? 
i do n't care . 
no harm in that .  he 's a young guy havin' fun being a cop .  i know the type trust me on this .  he 's more interested in ordell than the money .  if he 's gonna do anything suspect it 'll be cutting corners to get the conviction but he would n't walk off with the money .  it 's evidence . 
no i mean you right now .  not it you were somebody else . 
uhhuh . 
did you do it that night ? 
you know a good cop wo n't let you know he knows you 're fulla shit . 
well you know i 'm not going to show him the whole amount .  he 'll see fifty thousand . 
he wo n't  i mean he did n't the last time .  he 'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is  on top . 
you 're gonna have surveillance all over you . 
it 's not that simple . 
uhhuh . 
less ten percent . 
i hesitated taking that much . 
i 'm sure . 
i never lied to you .

this time ?  almost a year .  i 've known him forever . 
hi melanie .

a woman . 
yeah but it 's my money and i do n't need me a partner . 
i can do that . 
look it 's my ass facin' the penitentiary .  you send some hard headed roc whore and she fucks things up .

i know you do n't know .  i said guess . 
so we on the same page then ? 
that 's not what i meant when i asked did you trust her . 
yep .

hang it up she 's on her way .  you gotta listen to this .  this involves you . 
that 's what i got to talk to you about .  you see melanie was giving me a hard time 
you know how she is . 
you could n't just hit her ? 
look that 's the bag she came out with .  she never even put her hand in it and neither did i . 
you sure she ai n't somewhere with a halfamillion dollars i worked my ass off to earn ? 
pull the car over . 
or .  .  .    .  .  . she gave it to somebody else first before melanie went in the dressing room . 
you gonna tell me who it was ?

hell yes they know each other .  he bonded her out of county .

jacob i do n't believe in demons not in the empirical sense .  i do n't be lieve in devils fighting for our souls .  i do n't believe in enternal damnation .  i do n't believe in other worldly creatures tormenting us .  we do n't need them .  we do a good enough job on ourselves . 
look .  i do n't pretend to know what 's going on inside your head .  for all i know it 's pathological and they should be pumping valium into your veins by the quart .  but if you 're not willing to accept the help of sci ence and believe me i admire you for that then you 'll have to do bat tle on your own .  what can i say ?  it 's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls .  but to be pursued by  .  .  .  demons no less  .  .  .  there are no guides jacob .   you wanna know what i 'd do if i sud denly started seeing demons ?  i 'd hail the first taxi that came along shoot over to bellvue and beg them for shock treatment .  i 'm no saint .

what if we blow the walkways first ?  leave jason over here to go up with the ship ? 
we made it ? 
not so fast yllo !  there 's a protocol here . 
i still think we should send for a team of real scientists . 
right now i care only for the safety of this crew .  you do n't know anything about these two 
not a chance . 
you got that right . 
not an option .  i 'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down .

the best interest in this town would be to see that fish bellyup in the water with a hole in his head .  you do the right thing .  you authorize me .   right there .  whatever it costs . 
what d 'ya mean ? 
let 's all have a drink . 
something else .  do most attacks go unreported ? 
it 's called territoriality .  it 's a theory . 
if you 're looking for a shark you do n't look on land .  you go out and chum for him . 
i bought it .   both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me stocks went up so i do n't have to touch my principal . 
no shark did that to a boat ! 
it 's a whale out there .

just a little appetizer .  i want our porker to know we 're serving .  i want to put some iron into that big yap .  .  . 
real fine stuff but it wo n't mean a thing to mr .  whitey of course .  .  .  he did n't go to schools in electronics .  he was born with what he does best .  eat .  he 's a swimming appetite .  course he might eat this stuff but then i 've seen him eat a rocking chair too .   next time ask me .

like i 'd marry you !  you would be the meanest wife of all time .  and anyway i know you were n't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on tv .  the blair witch project was on starz and you were like oh i want to watch this but we should make out instead .  la la la . 
forget it bleek .  take katrina the douche packer to the prom .  i 'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time ! 
yeah .  that was me . 
that 's all i need from you .  that 's more than i could ever ask for .  you 're just golden dude . 
you are always trying to keep it real .  i 'm in love with how you feel .  i do n't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you . 
no .  .  .  i guess not . 
i 'm an ultrasound technician ma 'am . 
hon did you get expelled ? 
cool it . 
i do n't know i just did .  and while we were waiting for vanessa mark and i watched the wizard of gore and he burned me some cds of weird music .  he 's kind of cool . 
it does n't work that way kiddo .  you do n't know squat about the dynamics of marriage . 
it really did n't hurt that bad having him . 
something happened .  because your eyes ?  are very cold ?  they 're very cold josh .  they 're cold lying eyes . 
viscera ? 
tell me about it .  i used to play in a really tight band back when i lived in chicago and one night we opened for the melvins .  .  .  do you know who the melvins are ? 
no she 's working late tonight .  she 's trying to accrue some extra time off for when you know .  .  . 
that 's what you think .  i drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuterbabies that 's born without junk . 
i know what junk is . 
we definitely want it to have junk . 
hey i like this . 
i did n't .  but it 's a threeway tie between the stooges patti smith and the runaways . 
yeah i definitely need to make you some cds .  at least while my kid is hanging out in there . 
you 're something else . 
i came over as soon as i got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis .  my stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises . 
i imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point . 
consider it your musical education . 
is n't that great ?  i got it when i was in japan with my band .  she reminds me of you . 
most fruitful yuki is bad ass man .  you should be proud to be the same condition . 
her name was cynthia vogel and she was a good dance partner .  even let me put my hands on her butt . 
no ? 
yeah i guess .  .  .  is this my fault ?  is vanessa mad at you because of me ?

he asked her .  i heard they were going to benihana then the prom then to vijay 's parents' cabin . 
i would n't be so sure about that .  he did it with you .  he 's a man now . 
i 'm not jealous and i do n't care .  i just know he does n't like katrina and i do n't think he should toy with her emotions like that .  she seems so nice and all . 
well i was born to be a mother .  some of us are . 
juno just wanted a closer look at kimber here . 
no it 's fine .  thanks for making the call i guess .

oh shit . 
yeah i get bored .

not too late . 
if i had it maybe .  but right now i do n't have a penny to my name . 
all right . 
you want a wipit ? 
i would n't know . 
sit down ! 
no .   she just moved here last month from portland . 
maybe he 's going to drug her ? 
i 've seen a lot of things in my time on the job but nothing like this .  yurilivich ? 
it 's a voice modulator . 
you were n't mad at him for picking up the phone ? 
did anyone stand out ? 
but a hundred men could move him . 
oh c 'mon .   we 're not going to spend any more time on this crap are we ?   it does n't mean anything .   it 's sanderson ! 
it is n't him .   frank you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this . 
you 're not going to tell me that . 
you know her ? 
because she 's the type . 
you heard me .   why did you go out to the institute looking for her ? 
very nice speech peter .   did you rehearse that or was it impromptu ?   there 's an old wooden bench in the garden .   next to it is a rock .   you 'll find a message for you under it .   let 's see if you 're as clever as you think you are . 
can we correlate data ?   look for specific things like player 's ages .  .  .  stuff like that ? 
okay .   run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the island . 
set up some pieces on the big board ? 
he 's in his seventies and lives in holland . 
what scars ? 
i admit i handled it badly .   sanderson was n't going to talk to me .  .  .  but you 're young attractive
why did he what ? 
you 're losing me . 
not really .   it 's pretty boring . 
it ca n't be a coincidence .   the woman that owns it has a son .   she says he 's been on vacation in montana for the last ten days .   we 're trying to locate him .   there 's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week .   we 're checking that out too . 
what does that mean ? 
you know i hate to say i told you so but i warned her .   coming home at all hours of the night .   a young girl new to the city .   this neighborhood ai n't what it used to be . 
through a rental agency . 
she called to give me my schedule for tomorrow . 
what 's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing .   yet she says on her message for you to call her at home and she does n't leave a number .  that would imply you already knew the number . 
it does n't make sense . 
wait a minute .   there 's an apartment in that area called the castle arms . 
that 's got to be it . 
he knows you 're aware of that . 
whatever 's on your mind . 
feel like practicing ? 
what are they please ? 
that 's a very personal question . 
are you disappointed that i wo n't answer you ? 
i thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess . 
i ca n't right now .   i 've got a game . 
in a way . 
how can you look at it so clinically ? 
okay .   so tell me about yourself .   are you married ? 
very good .   spoken like a true psychologist .   when confronted with the prospect of your own reality hide behind quotations .   what is that masters and johnson ? 
you 're not ? 
does n't that scare you ? 
why ? 
you 've got to face the things you feel . 
you . 
if i have to .   i 'm going to take a shower . 
what ? 
i 'm not looking for an apology peter . 
move quickly .  we are coming for you .  we are in the fortress . 
i knew you would come . 
yes . 
you ca n't reach her !   through the door .   quickly ! 
yes .  each dawn it rises in a different land sometimes in the mountains sometimes in the jungle sometimes the desert sometimes the sea .  never in the same place twice . 
then even if lyssa tells us where she is we 'll never be able to reach her for they will never allow the fortress to rise near us . 
you have not slept in two days . 
no .  then they were led by his underlings .  but i knew he had come this time from the ferocity of their onslaught from their use of the fortress .  they use up much of their strength to do these things .  they are taking great risks . 
no .  she must agree of her own free will . 
you must never know her name .   if more than one approaches she will certainly kill them .  alone i may have a chance . 
let us wish him peace . 
i forbid you ! 
what will happen ? 
saddles . 
then give me comfort .  sleep with me tonight . 
a forest near the valley of needles . 
i have need of friends . 
fame is what you leave to your sons . 
those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men . 
and what do you think a small person lives in you oneeyed fool ?  leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination . 
i cannot go with you my friend . 
i  .  .  .    .  .  .  am titch . 
and do you think i 'm not going to eat myself to death this very night ?  huh ? 
we have plenty of hares . 
i am being exploited !  where are you going ? 
that creature helps no one .  and none who go there return . 
you said nothing .  you told me nothing . 
power you have given me .  what can my power give you ? 
he forgot his money .  .  .   my mother 's got a pub behind the corner and he forgot his money about 100 . 
ok .  mister stansfield norman stansfield . 
 .  .  . i heard he said .  .  .  that 's all .  .  .  thanks . 
asshole .  but she wo n't miss anything that .  you 'll see . 
 .  .  . what ? 
yeah . 
it 's better .  .  .   you see it 's my turf so i do n't want contracts i 'm not informed about on my turf .   i 'm not opposing but the least they can do is informing me is n't it ? 
yes . 
i 'll explain you leon they 'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you ca n't write and they 'll ask you your job your employer 's name and you ca n't tell them my job i 'm a hitman and my employer is tony his record is longer than his resturant 's menu .   that 's why you ca n't have a bank account ! 
take them you never know .  .  .  if you want to have some fun .  take it 's a gift . 
130 .  .  .  140 .  .  . 
look .  when you can see his fingers it 's 50 meters .   when you just see his hands it 's about 80 meters .  when you distinguish arms from body it 's 120130 .  when you see nothing more than a shape you do n't shoot .   not very sure .  you have one chance out of five to miss .   a contract means getting all chances on your side .  5 out of 5 .   you ca n't miss a client .  never .  .  .  if the task is delicate or the risk is too big you double .  that is you insure yourself by another means . 
it 's not serious it 's just training .  you have to learn from the beginning to hit the target then to improve precision you 'll train but on cardboards . 
mathilda do n't resume please .   .  .  .  . change subject ok ? 
 .  .  . i 'd like knowing what he 's listening to .  .  . 
 .  .  . later . 
that was n't bullshit i said we love each other . 
 .  .  . you 're young mathilda .  .  .  you still have a chance to get out .   you ca n't give up this chance .  you have to protect it .  there 's a lot of things to do in life a lot of other jobs .  .  . 
yeah i know !  but for the moment you 're not yet a woman .  so be patient .  .  .  i need time .  .  .  and you too .  you have to grow up . 
why ?  did you have too many and you fear it may shock me ?   i wo n't get shocked .  i 'm used to this !   my father was a true pig .  he fucked the bitch i 'd as mother all around the apartment .  whenever a door was closed you could be sure they were making sex behind it !   and my sister if you did n't sleep with her you 're building 's exception ! 
it 's impossible . 
if you really want to do this .  .  .  plan it out .   rest up .   train for it .   build up your body .   plan every stop along the way .   how much money ?   time ?   really do it properly .   this is all so  by the seat of your pants . 
i think my uncle is suffering from a condition called mania which is linked with depression .   it is a time when an individual will act overconfident and will act out impractical grandiose plans .  sometimes these plans can be dangerous . 
it can but it 'll have to wait in line . 
okay . 
what 's that ?   that 's not a fortune .  .  .  you will be rich .  .  .  that 's a fortune .   what you have is a statement . 
i will  i promise . 
you like to take walks ? 
he 's plastered . 
pacifica california . 
good . 
not our problem . 
it 's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the steadman's house . 
maurice and ellen parker .  .  .  it was issued in philly .  .  .  mr .  maurice parker has come a long way from home .   why ? 
parker .   right .   get on the horn with philly .   call me here . 
i 'm isaac .  .  .  i 'm three . 
i 'm maurice parker .  .  .  i 'm much older than three .   are your parents home ? 
right .   but everyone saw how small isaac was and laughed .  .  .  but not big billy .   he stared at isaac carefully and then told him to join the game .   it came to the end of the game .   it was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game .  .  . 
by car right ? 
they called her lizy' in the book .  .  .   sorry i was late .   my jeep died on the way over from the paper . 
where ? 
he wants to reward you .  .  .  that 's why i 'm here . 
what do you mean ? 
i mean you 've done a great thing .  you should be rewarded monetarily . 
orange soda ? 
no . 
we can go to one if you 'd prefer . 
why should i ?  i know you 're not a cop so what is it tonight ?  another twofifty to watch you sleep ? 
i have to change and take a shower first .  if you want to come home and wait . 
thank you .  what time is it ? 
i like hearing you talk .   if you feel up to a short walk there 's a place to eat around the corner .  all the food in vegas is terrible so the place does n't really matter .  how does that sound to you ? 
do they have drinks ? 
three nights two days .  when is your rent coming up at the motel ? 
what do you mean ? 
right .  .  .  ok .  .  . 
then come .   i 'm going to change .  watch tv .  i 'll be half an hour . 
here 's my speech .  .  .    .  .  . i know this should n't be acceptable to me but it is .  do n't ask me why .  i sense that your trouble is very big .  .  .  and i 'm scared for you .  .  .  and so i 'm doing what i think you need me to do .  falling down in casinos is little stuff .  it does n't bother me .  it has nothing to do with us . 
ok but remember that they wear it because they have to .  i wear it because i want to .  that 'll make me look different .  let 's get a drink . 
thank you sera . 
do you want me not to go tonight ? 
they would n't know . 
last spring i happened to walk past a house that i had once patronized .  there was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window i could see a bare leg .  the girl must have been taking a break between customers .  it was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that i was late for something already i just stayed there loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and .  .  .  the reason i 'm telling you this epilogue is that i felt that i 'd come full circle . 
yes .  .  .  i guess i knew that . 
hey ben .  there were a couple of guys looking for you . 
the news is not good kid .  this bit here .  .  .  see there .  .  .  it 's broken .  you need a new  one . 
how much do you think ? 
i do n't know .  i 'll find out though . 
i will keep you safe .  we are both older . 
i got up went to starbucks went to the gym got a perm and came home . 
where you got in the shower . 
because they got wet . 
she 's younger than i am .  did she tell you that ?  how would you feel if your father married someone younger than you ? 
yes .  but i ca n't tell you what it is . 
you 're a beautiful girl elle . 
so everything you just said 
forget it .  i 've already spent too many hours crying over you . 
how about 
well i recommend knowing before speaking .  the law leaves much room for interpretation  but very little for selfdoubt . 
no ! 
definitely !  i love him ! 
trust me .  you 've got the equipment you just need to read the manual . 
really ?  thanks . 
maybe you should sleep with the judge too .  then we can win the case . 
your scrunchie ? 
i ca n't believe you guys are actually here  but this case is important .  i 'll make it up to you after finals okay ?  i  promise .  i really want to do a good job . 
no but she made me cry once .  not in class  i waited until i got to my room but yeah she can pretty much shrivel your balls  or you know your whatevers . 
aside from that . 
how do you figure ? 
we 're on our way to the bridal show in new york so we thought we 'd rescue you from law school for the night . 
i do n't know 
uh no .  maybe you should try the lido deck . 
so are you ! 
and i fully support that . 
so you 're breaking up with me because you 're afraid your family wo n't like me ?   everybody likes me ! 
you got into harvard law ? 
what like it 's that hard ? 
uh  sure . 
sarah was my girlfriend at prep school .  we got back together over the summer at my grandmother 's birthday party . 
that 's because i spend all my time with case studies and hypos . 
am i on glue or did i not get into the same law school you did warner ? 
thank you . 
huh .  imagine that .  looks like i am . 
yes . 
it 's not a theta 
you 're right .  phew ! 
faith . 
always . 
i doubt the faeries will admire their beauty .  .  .  come this will be fun to watch . 
indeed the best of fun .  .  .  enjoy yourselves . 
what do you want with me ? 
you are cruel !   your heartless jesting worse than torture !   how can you speak of love when you see what i am ! 
then why hide behind a mask ?   you are ashamed ! 
i can keep a victim alive for weeks .  .  .  months if i desire it .  .  .  it 's an art .   they beg for death .  .  .  i keep it just out of their reach .   the pain remains constant . 
what ?   speakee loud !   no hear velly good . 
oh no never .  .  .  nothing like that .  .  .  never crossed my mind . 
dlagon not like that .   dlagon is spilit of life .  .  .  spilit of stlength and goodness . 
an' how you do it ?   how you rift cuss ?

i 'm not denying it 's a joyous day 
she lives like all the world before the baron's curse lifted .   now the world 's reborn yet still she sleeps .  .  .

no there does n't .  not really  just so many want it to exist .  .  .  so many who do n't want to die .  .  .  want it so much that a place called sanctuary becomes real .  but it does n't exist .  it never existed .  just the hope . 
you 're wrong !  !  it has to be !  !  it just has to be !  ! 
sanctuary is the right to live .  .  .  nothing more .  but nothing less either .  .  .

you 'd be surprised my dear conway how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems . 
that my dear conway is the story of a remarkable man . 
who ? 
when was all this ? 
yes yes .  they were very sincere about it too .  you see a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here .  they 've never known anything different .  so what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here . 
108 and still active ? 
oh no .  just a little bowled over that 's all . 
very often . 
the high lama arranges everything mr .  conway . 
you get out of here !  if any of you men think you can come busting in here

do n't push it .  you way ahead .  you back on top .  that boy loves you man . 
i can show you how to get out of prison .  and it 's no hype . 
the first men on earth were black .  they ruled and there was not one white face anywhere .  but they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees .  black men were never like that . 
i will not touch the white man's poison his drugs his liquor his carrion his women . 
but the key to islam is submission .  that is why twice daily we turn to mecca to the holy of holies to pray .  we bend our knees in submission . 
 the hardest and the greatest . 
tell him that . 
you can grovel and crawl for sin but not to save your soul .  pick the lock malcolm pick it . 
i 'm sure we can .  this is a new sister sister betty . 
i 'm telling you god 's words not to hustle . 
brother benjamin do not rush it has to be exact . 
why not ?  you 've had ample time you and the sister . 
let me explain .  no .  i 'll do better than that .  i 'll show it to you .  scientifically .  but it 's demonstration purely in the interest of science you understand ? 
so it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat .  the meat itself is foul . 
how old are you betty ? 
and dogged when i set my mind to something . 
yes i did .  did you hear my answer ? 
i 'll be away a lot . 
say what you 're saying . 
two years in the women's reformatory at framingham . 
but our crime was n't burglary .  it was balling white girls .  they gave us the book . 
i mean it 's late baby . 
i 'm going to bed .  i gotta work tomorrow need my rest . 
 there is a serious question as to whether 
i think sometimes mrs .  little candor is the only kindness . 
did you hear me ?  ! 
to wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition .  the ministers say you are spreading untruths about the messenger .  the ministers say you are a great hypocrite judas benedict arnold .  the ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the messenger 's doorstep . 
let me die then . 
i wo n't let myself come between you and your father .  go home . 
me ? 
fine as may wine . 
well sammy 's dead .  yeah fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him .  had twentyfive grand in his pocket .

japanese are here in a big way .  cheap labor .  factory space .  but they feel a lot safer living over the border in el paso .  i ferry em back and forth .  they think i 'm johnfucking wayne . 
and a level five shithole is better than a level six .  your logic 's inescapable .

no . 
the traffic takes some getting used to . 
planned what ? 
what was her name ? 
camila .  camila valencias . 
do you know what she told me last night ? 
for a few months .  hire someone cheap .  you have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance .  then fire him for incompetence .  the important thing is lisa 's daughter will return to school . 
for an american she understands this country very well . 
when ? 
no .  not by the rules of polite society at least . 
i should start going for your tits first . 
yes .  but if i traced creasy to you others will do it as well .  their facilities are as good as my own if not better . 
what happened to him ?  what happened to creasy ? 
she 's all right andy .  it 's just that i get one saturday night off every three weeks and i was expecting something better that 's all . 
i came to see you .  how you feel ? 
i keep one eye open when i sleep because she 's gonna come in stab me in my bed . 
oh catherine please !  do n't make a tragedy .  you come to my house where you know you be happier yourself . 
it pains that they should do this . 
were the lights on ? 
catherine you are a blanket of gloom .  wherever you are the rain follows .  someday you gonna smile and we gonna declare a holiday . 
so there you are .  so i guess i 'm not such a dog as i think i am . 
i 'm thirtyfour . 
i 'm a catholic you know and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin . 
yes i know . 
why do n't you just move out to portchester ? 
well that 's what i was saying .  my father is getting old .  and we 're very close .  he 's a wonderful man really .  .  . 
no thank you .  i do n't think i should stay very long .

no .  .  . 
please .  .  . 
nothing . 
how do you do ? 
well siddown a minute .  i just come inna house .  i 'll take off my coat .  siddown a minute . 
i do n't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life . 
yeah .  i was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl . 
what ? 
i 'll see you . 
that means he 'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old . 
you 're the accountant inna family and i figure you might know about these things .  my boss wantsa sell his shop to me .  his kids are all married you know and he and his wife live alone and they wanna move out to california where his daughter lives so he wantsa sell his shop .  he wants five thousand dollars down although i think i can knock him downa four .  .  . 
what girl what does she know ?   why do n't you let her hold the baby once in a while ?  !  your mother boy she wantsa take the kid for a day that 's fine ! 
well i do n't know .  he sits arounna house alla time .  you know a place he can go where he can find a bride ? 
the stardust ballroom .  it 's loaded with tomatoes . 
she was here you know wednesday and i said catherine my sister .  .  . 
that 's all right that 's all right .  .  . 
all right ginnie .  i do n't wanna talk anymore about it .   i do n't think i got one hour 's sleep the whole night .   last night was the first time in my life i ever heard my mother cry you know that ? 
you 're welcome to one of these whatever they are . 
i do n't know what else .  you 've been that route a little have n't you ? 
there 's only one way . 
four goddam months .  and they do n't even give you time off for good behavior . 
i done my shopping in seoul last night . 
the spot we picked to spend the winter .  maybe we ought to look a little harder . 
we think the same way . 
it 's that disrespect for you that 's what i ca n't forgive them . 
finest kind .  we 're training hojon to be a bartender .  join us ? 
 .  .  . and for our supreme commander over here and our commanderinchief in washington . 
shut up or i 'll tear you apart . 
you betcher ass general . 
must be fun .  but the point we want to make about henry .  .  . 
if you do n't know what you 've seen why should i ? 
the painless pole plans to cross the great divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out . 
well he would n't score more than once in seven or eight tries but the important thing was he did n't waste time socializing .  anyway trapper john this is me lay . 
i do n't know why .  as long as it 's light enough to see your caddie . 
dartmouth 's too big and too expensive .  if he 's as good as i think he is he can move into the big league later .  but androscoggin first . 
we 'll cut him in on the bets we make .  and still have enough profit to send hojon to college . 
might make kind of a social issue not having any other negro officer . 
that do n't surprise me .  if you 're a good observer you must have observed by now that frank burns is a jerk . 
and his track record that do n't count ?  look honey when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss . 
it 's possible
they do n't have to be dull .  i mean if you and me put our minds together .  .  . 
you 'd think now with only six weeks before they ship me back home it would be easier .  but it is n't . 
how would he avoid it .  .  .  as if i needed to ask ? 
it could be a purely impersonal thing .  what matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions . 
i 'm fond of painless and i 'd feel terrible if anything happened to him .  .  . 
it 's your decision maria .  i do n't want to highpressure you . 
second pint . 
yes reverend ? 
thanks reverend .  thank you both for tipping me off .   you do n't know a captain forrest or a captain pierce do you ? 
glad to help . 
proud to know you trapper .  like to shake your hand if you 'll hurry up and get that chest closed .   you still working the trains ? 
that 's about the only thing i do n't do  that i 'm built for .  i inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital .  sometimes i tend bar and act as bouncer . 
there 's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another . 
christ .  all of a sudden it 's west point . 
i did .  first and only blow .  so far . 
we 've got too many wounded for us to handle now !  get on the phone right away and .  .  . 
stop that o 'rielly ! 
sir ? 
oh get out of here ! 
yeah .  lavender and old lace ! 
yeah i 'm all right . 
never mind those guys .  all right stand up .  now let 's see what you look like when you protest . 
against what ? 
money ?   well i 'm glad to hear somebody admit it .  do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over ? 
yes sir . 
no no nothat 's your seat . 
yes .  the john doe party . 
oh yes you will ann dear  .   .   .  you 're very clever . 
yeah i know .  what are you looking for ? 
well yes i know dear but these people are in such need and we have plenty now . 
yeah i do n't know .  i simply ca n't get it to jell !   i created somebody who 's gonna give up his life for a principle hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and unless he says something that 's well that 's sensational it 's just no good ! 
darling there are so many complaining political speeches .  people are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio .  if you 're going to have him say anything why do n't you let him say something simple and real something with hope in it ?  if your father were alive he 'd know what to say . 
huh ? 
look mr .  connell  .   .   .  i just ca n't afford to be without work right now not even for a day .  i 've got a mother and two kid sisters to  .   .   . 
what 's that ? 
the letter from john doe . 
the one we hire for the job you lunkhead ! 
holy smokes !  wasting my time listening to this mad woman . 
oh let me go will you ! 
yeah a little . 
hey do you know something ?  she supports a mother and two kids .  what do you know about that ? 
both of em ? 
the heelots ! 
yeah .  that 'sthat 's him .  of course you do n't know grubbel but he 's the man that everybody figured was the worst noaccount in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody 'd have anything to do with him .  er that is until murphy the postman told us the truth .  why grubbel he says he lives out of garbage cans because he wo n't take charity .  because it 'd ruin his selfrespect he says . 
well anyway ii guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came except the delaneys .  the delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money so why bother about inviting him ?  until grimes the milkman spoke up and he said say you 've got the delaneys all wrong .  and then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week and how when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty .  if you ask me he says they 're starving . 
the elevators are still runnin' . 
yeh .  say how much money we got left ? 
yeh . 
why d .  b .  you 're not going to fall for
okay .  i just came in to get warm myself .  come on let 's go . 
whyuh
how ? 
run a story .  say john doe was in here and is sorry he wrote the letter and
better get that story in hank it 's getting late . 
ah you bet your life you did n't !  you look in your papers ladies and gentlemen and you 'll find miss mitchell 's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it ! 
thanks . 
no she just left .  i 'm surprised you did n't run into her .  she went over to mr .  norton's house . 
uhhuh . 
well i was just thinking about this john doe business .  why as soon as it comes out it 's all a fake you 'll be washed up in baseball wo n't you ? 
how ? 
now look .  i 'll give this money to the colonel just as soon as you get started .  we 'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you . 
hold him .   yes mrs .  brewster i 'm listening .

swat is a lifesaving unit you know . 
you have to .  it 's a tradition . 
why ?  you like my ass ? 
explain how that works . 
every couple of months huh ? 
no .  actually i think it 's fucking crazy i do n't know if i could do it . 
so why would you hesitate to lie to save lives ? 
i have two words for you .  .  .  seek help . 
so what do you want ?  .  .  .  an autograph . 
he 'll be running at the quarter pole . 
occasionally you lose . 
and doing a very good job of it .

i do n't know but i 've got to get on there . 
you 're crazy . 
you 've got to decide that for yourself . 
then we better get moving .  .  .  but there 's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence . 
only that floor . 
for the last week things have been going pretty well between us .  i think we 've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff .  .  . 
in europe women find older men very sexy .

i ca n't do that . 
you know i ca n't assign you to this .  you 're much too close to it .  you were much too close to sam .  the department will take care of it . 
what have you promised them ? 
halden how nice to hear your voice . 
why 
someone who believes in miracles . 
yes .  .  . 
it 's his nature .

committee . 
yes .  they give it to a sub committee where they really give it a going overhold hearingscall in people and ask questionsthen report back to the bigger committeewhere it 's considered some more changed amended or whatever .  days are going by senator .  daysweeks .  finally they think it 's quite a bill .  it goes over to the house of representatives for debate and a vote .  but it 's got to wait its turn on the calendar
a committee of the majority party leaders .  they decide when a bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list
but you 've just taken care of the spirit all right . 
he did ? 
buti meanfor a womanandyou 've done awfully well
go right ahead . 
all right .  sure .  just curious .  the picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle or something
i know .  it 'sviolet . 
now susanthat 's really a pretty name
no
great . 
good !  i 'm going to be pretty busy tonight

yeah ?  well when i get my hands on a redheaded doll with a southern lingo i 'll
the head man's writing a bill . 
yesa camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading .  so calm down chickandgoodnight . 
joei 'm getting leery of this guy .  we keep calling him dumband he keeps winding up in our hair !  i 'm telling youwhen he finds out there 's a dam going up where he wants his camp he 's gonna start asking questions six ways from sunday
tomorrow !  joehe 'll hear the section on willet dam .  he ca n't be there ! 
well thenthis is too much for my lame brain .  i 'm calling jim taylor . 
well well ! 
okay .  see you here . 
by the way mr .  mcgann just phoned in a high fever .  smith 's gone again .  have you any idea where ? 
look senatori was n't given a brain just to tell a boy ranger what time it is .  what do you need me for ?  get somebody elseget a registered nurse
well when i first came to washington my eyes were big blue question marks now they 're big green dollar marks
what are you talking about ?  what difference ? 
so i go right back where i was carrying compromisescovering up back to political tricksthis time for !  no !  i was just getting rid of all that .  if i did anything i ought to go and tell him to stand up and .  no !  i do n't want any part of it !  smith or anything else !  i 'm all through .  i want to be left alone ! 
joewhat 's the matter with you where you 're concerned i would n't take the slightest risk 'specially now after the great reputation you 've made in the senate .  why look at this campaign i 've started for you in all my papers .  you 're the logical man from the west on the national ticketat the convention anything can happen
jimif what you say about the future is remotely possiblewhy not do as i saydrop things like this dam ? 
you ca n't say that to
noii 'll take a walk 
i 'm afraid we wo n't have room in the car father .  senator smith can follow with mr .  mcgann and the pigeons . 
who are you ? 
yes i
who 's that ? 
sometimes twice . 
uhhuh . 
all right mr .  dodsworth .  i think you 'll qualify .   take this to that desk over there for further instructions . 
no . 
your honor ! 
did you subsequently write a series of articles about him ? 
humoresque ?  i 'll bet you do n't even know how it goes . 
mary  i  excuse me
nothing . 
you started out to be a successful newspaper woman did n't you ? 
he 's got goodness mabel .  do you know what that is ? 
i just could n't stand seeing him again . 
leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow . 
sure . 
you 'll get it babe .  you 'll get it . 
why babe  that 's terrific !   cinderella man woos mystery girl !  who is the mysterious girl that
i 'm having lunch with him today .  he expects an answer .  it 's going to be pretty . 
you 're crazy !  you ca n't do that ! 
right . 
just one little drink  and then we 're ready to shoot . 
but a half million dollars !  my goodness where are we going to get
those flowers are too high .  wo n't be able to see her .   get a smaller bowl will you ? 
he 's not home i tell you ! 
i wanna see that guy ! 
nuisance value ? 
mr .  cedar ! 
wants to know who the heir is . 
hang up . 
make three reservations on the first train out to mandrake falls vermont . 
mandrake falls .   man
what ?  there must be 2000 of them out there . 
why the chairman presides at the meetings . 
we own an opera house do n't we ? 
i guess it is .  but i personally would n't care to be head of a business that kept losing money .  that would n't be common sense .  incidentally where is the 180000 coming from ? 
well we were rather expecting it to come from you . 
you see mr .  deeds the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business . 
it reminds me very much of this one .  nicht wahr ? 
oh mr .  deeds
what kind of wife did you say she was ? 
a child ?  my uncle 's ? 
i say we do n't want to appear greedy . 
that 's all right .  i got it off my chest . 
binge ? 
farmer ? 
get up from there .  i do n't want anybody holding the ends of my pants .  get up from there ! 
yes sir . 
miss dawson sir ?  no sir .  no miss dawson has called sir . 
that 's what the two policemen said sir . 
you kept searching me last night sir .  going through my pockets .  you said you were looking for a rhyme for budington . 
but she 's on the telephone
they said if i did n't get help they would n't deal with me any more .   what do you think about that ? 
hmm ? 
it 's happened before .   i 'm shocked by how little i 'm feeling .  i ca n't understand it .   i 'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon wo n't i ? 
phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city .  which leaves you the only psychologist in town . 
why ?  i 'm paying for this . 
you came because it 's taking over .  you 're in its grip . 
now we 're back on track . 
oh ? 
i 'd better get in there . 
that 's a lot of people all at once . 
salad nicoise ?  i love salad nicoise . 
who was that ? 
not sure .  let me think about it . 
it 's a pretty piece of land . 
no gentleman caller doc .   not that i care .  i 've had it with men .  they 're so fascinated by their own crap .  took me four years to get the last one out .  almost turned me into a dyke .  .  .  these days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed .  now that feels good .  and you do n't have to do all that .  .  .  listening . 
where am i supposed to eat ? 
he told you . 
you would have met in some shower eventually .  .  . 
got a license ?   but no car ? 
i been drivin' since i was twelve . 
got to . 
no .  .  .  sort of .  man she could be cool but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys .  she 's blowin' them in the parking lot . 
insane !  did n't ja hear ?  my family got five hundred times better .   let 's go vanessa . 
do you think that 's a good idea ? 
that 's right the fake kind . 
i 'd better not i 'll fall right to sleep .  i think it 's too soon for me to be sleeping with you . 
hmm as in  that 's interesting .  sometimes with enough clues it 's possible to figure these things out . 
maybe you 'll catch it . 
can i ask you something ?   did n't you tell my dad you did n't think it was a good idea to come to the patient ?   so what changed ? 
we 'll turn back anytime you want . 
where ? 
life . 
what ? 
why do you think you tell me nessa ? 
pro boner ?   pro bono huh ?  for whose good supposedly ? 
this shrink school you went to .  .  .  did you hear about it on an infomercial ? 
do you think that 's what he wants ? 
what 'd he say ? 
no again ? 
of course !  that 's exactly what i want . 
you moved here from back east and your name is the same as this town .  is that right ?   far out . 
do n't tell me cause i 'm not going to tell you what i 've got . 
she 's probably ten years older than you . 
doc .  i know we 're not supposed to get together till wednesday .  .  . 
that 's right .  and you also know that even though i make 23 of the modems in the world .  .  .  i cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me . 
no doc not a doll .  i am panda .  i 'm talking about much much more than a doll .  the world has never seen what i 'm talking about .  .  .  except maybe in the movies . 
all new people start with that .  .  . 
i 'm honored . 
yep . 
the ritual to bring the body of anck sunamun back to life . 
and how does one do that ? 
by reading the book of the dead . 
excuse me ? 
i got caught robbing a synagogue .  lots of good stuff in them holy places churches temples mosques and who 's guarding them ? 
 and read the sacred incantations contained inside it . 
twenty . 
broad ?  ! 
no i mean 
the last time i was at that place everybody i was with died . 
oh that 's comforting . 
we 're about to be shown the way . 
no .  i believe if i can see it and i can touch it then it 's real .  that 's what i believe . 
personally i think he 's filthy rude and a complete scoundrel .  i do n't like him one bit . 
after all you rode us night and day to win that bet . 
do n't blame me i do n't even remember being there . 
he 's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon . 
got it . 
not quite .  you have n't announced our engagement yet . 
do it big boy ! 
he 's dead . 
should i kill them ? 
why bother ? 
really ? 
every night . 
nothing wrong with being a waitress . 
champion's going to bounce back and i want to be here when it does . 
and what if you get killed ? 
what a jerk  and like nobody knows who he really is ! 
but look at him .  .  .  and look at us . 
the most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced .  twenty years ago they were casanova 's personal bodyguard .  but after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork . 
well they 've crawled back out . 
are you serious ?  this is the break we 've been waiting for ! 
he has n't stolen it yet . 
really ?  like captain amazing ? 
we prefer to think of ourselves as unsung .  .  .  i am the blue raja master of silverware .  .  .  
what are you doing in the silver drawer ? 
and mister furious .  .  .  his anger is his power . 
sorry . 
be a mohican .  
whatever our name is . 
and this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since . 
my dear caulaincourt agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live .   napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure england but before that he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live .   he cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring england to her knees  and i 'm afraid that is what it has come to . 
well has your majesty considered what napoleon's alternatives might be if you simply chose to ignore his note ? 
ah yes  proceed . 
perhaps it would be even more serious than that your majesty .  his european confederation is held together by some very slender threads .   your majesty knows even better than i that austria and prussia are very doubtful allies and the emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him at the first sign of weakness . 
if i can presume to go into the emperor 's mind i believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of moscow .   when vienna fell there was a peace treaty .   when berlin fell another treaty .   that has always been the rules of the game .   but what is he to do now if no treaty is forth coming ?   he knows that beyond moscow there is nothing and that if he withdraws there remains only a fall into emptiness . 
may i come to the map ? 
the 21st dragoons about two or threehundred troopers . 
any cannon ? 
where are they ? 
i must be honest with you .   i first approached three generals more senior than yourself and they all very prudently sent excuses . 
i do n't know the details of the treaty sire marshal mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to and he said that i was to take the army and make for fontainebleau . 
yes sir . 
thank you sir .   i will do that . 
you would tell me joseph would n't you ? 
the comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already . 
you must not act impetuously . 
when is she supposed to return ? 
only as a last resort .   what are the councils doing now ? 
thank you madame de beauharnais .  you probably do n't recall but we met briefly a few months ago at a party at paul 's house . 
well i 'm sure that you will be just as pleased to have this as he will be . 
do you expect me to believe that ? 
yes . 
not in the least .   after all what is adultery  only a brief transaction on a couch requiring a few minutes of privacy . 
promise me . 
promise . 
perhaps  but tell me you promise anyway . 
all right  i promise . 
what are you doing in there ? 
oh my darling .   i 'm sorry too .   i wo n't do that again  whatever you do .   i wo n't cause you any more embarrassment i promise . 
indeed  well you may tell dr .  corvisart i should be entirely satisfied with half her success . 
nothing .   that 's all i can say . 
well whatever the hell you wanted to do you are going to tell me everything right now .   do you understand ?  ! 
my god what do you think ? 
i know . 
you are much younger and much more handsome than your pictures . 
yes i do  very much . 
you are so good to me .   will you also allow me to have a botanical garden ? 
i am told that fontainebleau has many lovely views .   i know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside . 
papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me . 
my dear talleyrand none of the kings of europe bear any friendship for france .   it is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties .   the only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones i have won on the battlefield . 
and where do you place alexander ? 
he will stand by his agreement  i know him better than you do . 
you may save your philosophy for the magistrate monsieur varlac .   i am only a simple officer in the army and to me what you have done is called murder and his always been called murder by honest men . 
send him in . 
life is a burden for me .   nothing gives me any pleasure i find only sadness in everything around me .   it is very difficult because the ways of those with whom i live and probably always shall live are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight . 
if the french army had been commanded at jena and auerstadt by a tailor the king of prussia would certainly have gained the day . 
yo' cousin craig .   hook us up . 
if you see that boy again bite off his ear off like mike tyson . 
do n't need water .   we did n't have no pool in the projects .  .  . so none of us swim . 
'cause your lips is getting black . 
yes you did . 
i 'll do it . 
naw i already ate . 
black magic . 
fuuuuuuck  u ! 
i do n't . 
it is easy .  you know why ?   cause they 're not expecting it .  now roach you gotta occupy cheeco .  long enough for me and dayday to take a good look . 
you go first . 
wait for what ? 
oh yeah why you walking ? 
i do n't know . 
i hope you do n't think i 'm crazy but i just had to come in here and show you i ai n't scared of yo' punk ass brothers .  .  . and you would n't have be scared of em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life . 
yes i did .   excuse me . 
thanks for noticing .   it used ta be peaceful before they got out .   took over the house and caused my mother 's nervous breakdown . 
nice house .  did n't expect you to answer .  you must be one of those entertainers .  what team you play for ? 
delinquent property tax notice .  .  .  i hope the cracker killers pay well cause if not back to the ghetto you go .   wife stays here of course . 
18years of chasing dogs and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing .   i still ca n't figure that one out . 
i 'll remember . 
it 's a long story .   right now we gotta do somethin' . 
sir the manager stepped out for a moment .   i 'm currently running the store .  can i see the cd ? 
what up bro ? 
ever since my momma died the bills are always late . 
bummer huh ?   and friday is suppose to be a kickass day . 
let it go roach trust me . 
are you out your mind ?   i 'm not messing with them s . a . s boy .   you must be crazy . 
he 's inside the house ? 
do n't worry about it .   we gotta figure out a way to get craig out of there .  he 's probably getting tied up now . 
what ? 
'take your car ? '
come on el you 're a trooper .  i 'll get you some pepto you 'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person then back to sacramento .  this is no time to lay down on the job .  i do n't care what the polls say you ca n't afford to relax .  look what happened to bush .  tell you what if you want to blow off the sacramento speech fine .  but do this one and we 'll get out of the smog . 
i 've been a bad boy . 
sorry . 
i appreciate that . 
i 'd prefer we did n't refer to it as my last speech . 
indeed . 
you 're from santa maria mr .  watson ? 
yes .  it 's ok lynn .  these are our friends . 
you would n't .  .  . 
yes you will mr .  watson . 
at one thirty my little girl is dead . 
of course you 're invited .  you 're a big donor to the campaign .  they love you . 
you fucked up . 
do you now mr .  watson ? 
keep your voice down . 
i do n't see how they could be in on it .  they 're the best .  they 're hand picked . 
he 'll think you 're in the crowd until the end of the speech .  wait a minute . 
yeah . 
you 're going to deny me a lousy dollar after i 've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild ? 
you worthless piece of shit !  gimme that ! 
it looks real .  i do n't know anything about guns . 
everybody does ? 
i 've done much better ones than this . 
you 're wasting time . 
no . 
what do you figure he done with it ? 
that 's right preacher .  i robbed that bank because i got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food children roamin' the highways in this year of depression children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junkheaps and i promised myself i 'd never see the day when my youngins 'd want . 
you preacher ? 
the religion the almighty and me worked out betwixt us . 
ai n't nobody stole dad 's skiff . 
ca n't hear ye boy .    .  .  . so the big boats heave a sigh they blow for uncle birdie .  .  . 
when'll the skiff be ready ? 
just fine . 
shoot a horsehair 'll hold a lumpin' whale . 
how 's your own boy miz cooper ? 
how do you mean ? 
say what walt spoon ! 
about mr .  powell .  all of it !

no nothing . 
thank god . 
she 's entering deep sleep now .  heart rate 's a little high due to anxiety but otherwise she 's nicely relaxed .  all normal .  she could dream at any time now .   right now she 's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one 's mapped yet .  waiting to see what shows up . 
just like i did the hat .  have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up . 
me ?   wait a minute you ca n't bring someone out of a dream ! 
if i ca n't then you all can relax because it 'll just be a simple case of me being nuts . 
what !  ? 
he 's dangerous . 
nan i 
sure but .  .  . 
deal . 
uh she just saw you sir .  .  . 
i could hear you tossing and turning all night kiddo .  you 've no business going to school . 
right home after .  see you . 
get into bed . 
i will . 
mother for petesakes . 
great
nancy ? 
okay .  .  .  you need anything just call . 
okay . 
did you ask daddy to have the hat examined ? 
go on .  .  . 
they say you 've bottomed out when you ca n't remember the night before .   no more drinking baby suddenly i just do n't feel like it any more . 
i told you .   it was dark but i 'm sure there was someone else in there under the covers with her . 
i mean it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time .  but invisible razors .  she just .  .  .  opened up .  .  . 
really .  turn er up a little . 
no more fights . 
i know .  .  .  my heart is sad .  .  .  but my feet are happy .  when all the tanks and guns were roaring over the red square i sat here all by myself and played a beethoven sonata .  not bad at all .   are you expecting someone ? 
ever since you have been back from paris .  .  . 
i see . 
ninotchka you know i am your friend you can trust me .  .  .  .  did you bring back anything else ? 
it was very silly .  .  .  .  i would be ashamed to wear it here . 
as beautiful as that ?  what else ?  come tell me . 
evening gown ? 
you mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day ? 
yes . 
i do n't want to go to siberia . 
which part of the room is mine ? 
you might get me an accurate map of paris .  i want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city . 
huh ?  .  .  .  why do n't you get a haircut buljanoff ?  you all look so wintry comrades .  and why do we always keep the windows closed ?   is n't it amazing at home there 's still snow and ice and here .  .  .  look at the birds .  i always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries .  now i know why .  we have the high ideal but they have the climate .  .  .  well comrades i do n't think i need you any more . 
and there is a russian saying the cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses . 
with our cream situation what it is it is russia which should apologize to the cats . 
well gentlemen how about my proposition ? 
that 's all right . 
blue ?  let 's offset his mood .  find a striped one and brighten it with a great blaze of tie . 
good evening monsieur . 
i ca n't follow you gaston is n't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position ?  you being my servant ?  would n't you like to stand on an equal footing with me ? 
no sir . 
emphatically not sir .  the prospect terrifies me .  now do n't misunderstand me sir i do n't resent your not paying me for the past two months but the thought that i should split my bank account with you .  .  .  that you should take half of my life 's savings .  .  .  that is really too much for me . 
yes general savitzky ? 
yes . 
comrades if we ring nine times .  .  .  let 's go in . 
while you eat you look at the view . 
thank you for a wonderful dinner . 
ninotchka we are in the magic east the country of aladdin and his lamp .  .  . 
 .  .  . the russia of piroshki .  .  .  people will eat and love it . 
i am nina ivanovna yakushova envoy extraordinary acting under direct orders of comrade commissar razinin .  present me to your colleagues . 
do you know how much a cow costs comrade iranoff ? 
what can i do about it ? 
i 'm sorry sir but i must insist . 
in other words you do n't know . 
how long does it take a man to land ? 
yes very strange . 
yes it is . 
it 's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within .  there are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality . 
please do n't misunderstand me .  .  . 
i will start with you . 
thank you .  thank you . 
you are bringing in wrong values .  love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological or shall we say chemical process .  a lot of nonsense is talked and written about it . 
i acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all . 
you do n't have to do a thing .  chemically we are already quite sympathetic . 
do n't do it please . 
do n't pity me .  pity the polish lancer .  after all i 'm alive . 
i ca n't possibly think of a better reason . 
oh my barbaric ninotchka .  my impossible unromantic statistical .  .  . 
ninotchka or shall i say special envoy yakushova .  .  . 
i kissed the polish lancer too .  .  .  before he died . 
i always eat here . 
death !  death !  always so glum !  what about life ninotchka !  do russians never think of life ?  of the moment in which we are living ?  the only moment we really have ?  do n't take it all so seriously ninotchka .  nothing is worth it .  please .  .  .  relax .  .  .  i beg you sergeant .  .  .  smile ! 
why ? 
why ? 
it seemed funny to me when i first heard it .  maybe the trouble is n't with the joke .  maybe it 's with you ! 
i do n't think so . 
anything ninotchka . 
if you do n't want to answer you need n't .  but if you do you must tell me the truth . 
you must darling . 
and we wo n't stretch up our arms .  .  . 
our salute will be a kiss . 
all right . 
let 's turn on the radio . 
well then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven .  .  . 
it would n't be fair to the man in the street .   there they are .  .  .  they are terrible things those jewels .  .  .  . 
 .  .  . they are the tears of old russia .  .  .  see that stone ? 
it is their wish . 
i wo n't tell you what came between .  .  .  i 'll prove it .  it will take a long time ninotchka .  .  .  at least a lifetime . 
did you win ? 
oh leon you are so good to me .  
those newspaper people ? 
oh yes . 
what does he say ? 
darling you 're taking my business affairs far too seriously .  much as i 'd love to rob the bolsheviks of their filthy money i wo n't do it at the expense of your health .  particularly as we know we wo n't get much .   you look so pale .  .  .  pale but interesting . 
you have n't seen her yet ? 
that proletarian !  in the old days we 'd have had her flogged . 
no thanks swana . 
is this by any chance going to be a confession ? 
all right i 'll listen . 
your highness forgive this intrusion but .  .  . 
never .   i never said that about jews ! 
you do n't need to check the tape .   i know what i said . 
pay him .   pay him what he wants . 
i agree it 's ridiculous but 
i mean who the hell cares about this pennyante shit .   goldwater put it right .   he said well for christ 's sake everybody bugs everybody else we know that .   .  .  .  it 's the coverup not the deed that 's really bad here .   if only mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it give them the hors d 'oeuvre and maybe they wo n't come back for the main course .   that 's the tragedy of all this .   mitchell 's going to get it in the neck anyway .  it 's time he assumed some responsibility . 
that 's not the question john .   the question is why is he paying ? 
i think he means the kennedy assassination . 
sure .   lyndon jfk fdr  i mean truman cut the shit out of my investigation of hiss back in '48 . 
you know al men in your profession  .  .  .  you give em a pistol and you leave the room . 
for what ?  ! 
he 's completely lost touch with reality . 
it 's the supreme court sir you do n't get around it . 
evidently to install bugs and photograph documents . 
apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through mexico .   the fbi 's onto it .   we could have a problem with that . 
it was right after the pentagon papers broke .   they went in to get his psychiatric records . 
fucking hell . 
what do you mean sir ? 
 .  .  .  but even the presidency is n't enough anymore  .  .  . 
we ought to fire his whining ass .  right now when he 's on top .   you know what  it 'll set the right example for the rest of this administration . 
 .  .  .  beating out the other papers chasing girls  .  .  . 
he 'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain . 
it 's helms  it 's got to be . 
townsend gave us 300 grand .   belgium 's not worth more than 100 150  .  .  . 
for god 's sake when does this end ?  ! 
sir  .  .  .  six bodies . 
of course we 've tried but so far we 've come up with nothing that  .  .  . 
i 'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area mr .  president given our charter and the congressional oversight committees  .  .  . 
what ? 
it is not my practice to spy on the president .   doctor kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own . 
 .  .  .  but it has never been the policy of this government to accept that .  and it is certainly not cia policy . 
is that why you and kissinger are negotiating with the chinese ? 
but  .  .  .  if we were able to separate china from russia once and for all we can  we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century . 
no .   they make me sick .   they smell like death  .  .  .  i had two brothers die young .   but let me tell you there are worse things than death .   there is such a thing as evil . 
black irishman .   very moving .  turning and turning in the widening gyre  the falcon cannot hear the falconer  things fall apart the center cannot hold  mere anarchy is loosed upon the world  and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned  the best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity  .  .  .  but it ends so beautifully ominous  what rough beast its hours come round at last  slouches toward bethlehem to be born ?   .  .  .  yes this country stands at such a juncture . 
kennedy  never .   he 'll fry in hell for what he did to me .   but nixon does n't know that which is why i 'm gonna have to remind him he needs us a helluva lot more 'n we need him . 
it wo n't .   as long as i 'm here . 
and whose fault is that ?   if we 'd won in vietnam  .  .  . 
i beg your pardon 
he was he was .   we taught a class together at harvard .   but you know these backstabbing ivy league intellectuals they ca n't  .  .  . 
he 's turned into a drug fiend he shot people from helicopters in vietnam he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children .   he sees a shrink in l . a .   he 's all fucked up .  now he 's trying to be a hero to the liberals  .  .  .  if he gets away with it everybody will follow his lead .   he must be stopped at all costs . 
you remember john in '48  no one believed alger hiss was a communist .  except me .   they loved hiss just like they loved this ellsberg character .  east coast ivy league .   he was their kind .   i was dirt to them .   nothing . 
make some money dick prove yourself to the wall street crowd and let goldwater and rockefeller take the fall against kennedy . 
shit the press does n't care about the facts .   cronkite 's sticking it to me .  it 's their first big hit on richard nixon . 
my brother harold was about the same age as those kids john .   tuberculosis got him . 
you all know me .   i 'm one of you i grew up a stone 's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in yorba linda  .  .  . 
hello  .  .  . 
i like jazz  .  .  . 
yeah she lives in dallas  .  .  . 
now some people we both know them al think you can go stand in the middle of the bullring and cry mea culpa mea culpa while the crowd is hissing and booing and spitting on you .   but a man does n't cry .   i do n't cry .   you do n't cry  .  .  .  you fight ! 
i know  .  .  . 
it 's not fair buddy .   i can take the insults i can take the namecalling .  but i ca n't take the losing .   i hate it . 
buddy before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again you should remember people vote not out of love but fear .   they do n't teach that at sunday school or at the whittier community playhouse ! 
no .   i 'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again . 
amen to that . 
yeah  .  .  .  i 'm out . 
i 'll never run again .   i promise . 
de gaulle 's gonna be there .   and macmillan .   and adenauer .  nixon ca n't not be there . 
we  .  .  .  have n't announced anything  .  .  .  uh  .  .  . 
you should be going  .  .  .  the primaries are soon are n't they ?   new hampshire  .  .  . 
this .   above all . 
because  .  .  .  i have to relax . 
i 'm not scared buddy .   you do n't understand .   they 're playing for keeps buddy .   the press the kids the liberals  they 're out there trying to figure out how to tear me down . 
but they never will dick .   no matter how many elections you win they never will . 
it 's not the press that matters .  nixon's wife is proud of him . 
you .   what' you 're doing 
thank you ?   dick sometimes i understand why they hate you . 
i remember alger hiss .   i know how ugly you can be  you 're capable of anything .   but you see it does n't really matter at the end of the day what 's on them .   because you have absolutely no remorse .   no concept of remorse .   you want the tapes to get out you want them to see you at your worst  .  .  . 
well enough .   you 're looking happy nelson . 
hi happy .   well you 're obviously making him happy . 
whatcha mean by that ? 
well that 's wonderful .   so get me this crisis thing dick i 'll be glad to take a look at it . 
you heard it ? 
i 'm kindly surprised to hear you say that . 
yes you 've circled round . 
no i mean was it right away or in the night or when was it . 
you ca n't stop what 's comin .  ai n't all waitin' on you . 
believe you 're right . 
well i do n't either ! 
there 's a question .  whether they stopped bein' .  and when . 
yessir . 
when is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse . 
okay .  two of em .  both had my father .  it 's peculiar .  i 'm older now 'n he ever was by twenty years .  so in a sense he 's the younger man .  anyway first one i do n't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and i think i lost it .  the second one it was like we was both back in older times and i was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night . 
i put it in mama . 
i ai n't got the money . 
what little i had is long gone and they 's bill aplenty to pay yet .  i buried my mother today .  i ai n't paid for that neither . 
 .  .  . i need to sit down .

i need to know that . 
yeah .

you are comin back ai n't ya ? 
if you knew you would have it with you . 
you mean the nature of this conversation ?

airport . 
i guess that passes for manners in your cracker view of things . 
now .  we close now . 
sir ? 
you 've lived here all your life ? 
 .  .  . if that 's the way you wanna put it . 
call it ? 
for what ? 
just call it . 
well  we need to know what it is we 're callin' for here . 
no . 
you already have the tent ? 
the kind with the most poles . 
you get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on ? 
just drive me around .  i want to see if someone 's here . 
i do n't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here buddy . 
i want you to take me to another motel . 
no sir but you struck me as a man who would n't want to waste a chair .  i remember dates .  names .  numbers .  i saw him on november 28th . 
well you should find out .  she keeps talking about them .  .  . 
c 'mon betty open up !  i got some questions for you about .  .  . 
i ca n't .  .  .  they prefer a more formal presentation .  i do n't usually go so close to the surface but i was .  .  . 
yes it was .  betty saw the whole thing !  your killer 's name is chloe .  .  . 
 .  .  . and half the other guys in this town .  including you i believe .  .  .

i 'm not going out there !  let 's wait for the real police .  .  . 
great .  good .  content .  .  . 
they 're fine .  .  .  you miss it ? 
you must be joking . 
no just stand there .  .  .  lemme look at you a minute . 
sure .  you could probably have any thing you wanted .  .  .  somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself and you do n't even realize it . 
i would n't have put it quite that way but .  .  . 
well i certainly would have heard about that . 
of course he 's only here two days a week .  he 's also on staff over at loma vista . 
good .  i 'm prepared to offer you a job .  you can help out in the pharmacy until your california certification and references arrive but you are not to touch anyone .  is that totally clear ?   fine .  .  . 
betty honey listen to me .  a man came by from mutual life insurance .  he says you 've got money comin' to you from del 's policy .   del 's life insurance policy  are you with me ? 
the day i left you i just drove and drove .  i drove all day and all that night and i did n't go anywhere .  i just kept driving .  i stopped at a little country church and the pastor let me in and i sat 
he never told me anything about .  .  .  that 's unbelievable ! 
yes she is . 
she 's a good person to know .   so where did you study again ? 
of course . 
no i mean your dedication scares me .  .  . 
 .  .  . but i love listening to you so that 's okay .  .  . 
thanks .  but i 'd like to hear what you 're feeling .  .  .

later for that .  i 'm done either way .  .  . 
all of the above man .  .  .   and then some . 
mom !  it was n't like that .  it was bullsh .  .  .  they were just harassing us .  no charges were filed .  it 's alright . 
do you ? 
my pleasure sir . 
colonel will do . 
that one is a bit more difficult . 
yes sir . 
perhaps . 
thank you .   how 's the spotted one 's milk ? 
he vowed that if the assembly votes a single shilling to lee he 'll dissolve the body . 
i 've been doing this for two years .  i 'm the best scout in the continental army the best horseman the best shot the best scavenger and i know every deer path and swamp trail between here and charleston . 
granted .   where are you going ? 
is it her ?   is anne in there ? 
you know what happened . 
everyone knows .   it 's what made me a hero .   me harry lee all of us .   i got a medal .   men bought me drinks .  they still do sometimes .   everyone knows what happened . 
i 'm not my mother .   i ca n't have the respect without the knowing . 
thirteen years .  .  . 
 .  .  .  time royal succession regicide bribery .  .  . 
you said bribery twice .  .  . 
i 'm sorry i was n't here for this . 
they 're nothing but farmers and you 're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard .   they 'd be better off letting it move on . 
robert .   robert e .  lee . 
no there 'll be skirmishers on the roads .   we 're safer here . 
he looks as if he 's sleeping does n't he ? 
who is this paxcow ?  is he like the boogeyman ? 
anyone who can scream that loud is n't ready for intensive care just yet looks like she just skinned her knee . 
cause i had a bad dream about him .  i dreamed he got hit by a car and you and mr .  crandall buried him in the pet sematary . 
no more chocolate chip cookies . 
well it 's actually reincarnation but you get the idea .  and some people think we just wink out .  .  . like a candle flame when the wind blows hard . 
because your mother and i need the rest sugar .  now buzz . 
and i 'm going to eat his breakfast cereal too even though it tastes like boogers .  and .  .  . and .  .  . 
i swear . 
that roadand those orinco trucks are the two main reasons it 's there . 
i 'm sorry .  at least it do n't look like he suffered . 
seems like you told me about a promise you made
the place we 're going is on the other side of that . 
you 'll see before long .  let 's go . 
just do n't stop louis .  you do n't ever want to stop down here in little god .   and you do n't ever want to look behind you whatever you hear . 
no i 'm okay .  will i really be able to dig him a grave ?  the soil looks thin . 
what did we do jud ? 
ayuh .  it was the ragman told me about the placestanley bouchard .  us kids just called him stanny b .  he was half micmac himself . 
why then things should be fine . 
the door must not be opened .  the barrier must not be crossed .  do n't go on doc .  no matter how much you feel you have to .  there 's more power here than you know . 
you 've got one shot  and we ca n't die . 
elizabeth goes free ! 
you left me on a desert island  what worse can you do ? 
that 's fair . 
aye for us there is . 
now .   no do n't kill him . 
no .   but him i believe .   he us genuinely angry . 
because it 's what you 're searching for .   you 've been searching for it for years .   i recognize this ship .  i saw it eight years ago when we made the crossing from england . 
i ca n't breathe . 
one good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness . 
and that 's what concerns me .  elizabeth we will be landing in port royal soon and beginning our new lives .  would n't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station ? 
yes  yes . 
ceremony ? 
at least once more miss swann .  as always . 
do n't be thinking i 'm not already working on it . 
so that 's it ?   that 's the secret grand adventure of the infamous jack sparrow ?   you spent three days on the beach drinking rum ? 
a month ?   will does n't have a month !   we 've got to do something to help him ! 
nothing  .  .  .  it 's nothing .   just  .  .  .  i 'm reminded of a song i learned as a child .   a song about pirates . 
funny i was thinking along those lines .   how about you let me go in alone and while you 're setting up an ambush i 'll trick the pirates out to you . 
ah .   then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record .   so if you 'll excuse me  .  .  . 
only a little . 
pirate . 
move ! 
how ?   the key 's run off . 
we need to go ! 
i 'd die for her . 
no worries there .   she 's far more likely to rot out from under us . 
so 's breaking a man out of jail .  face it will you may say you 'll never be a pirate but you 're off to a riproaring start .   my advice  smile and enjoy it . 
he was a merchant marine !   he was a respectable man who obeyed the law and followed the rules
you think your father is the only man who ever lived the glasgow life telling folk one thing and then going off to do another ?  there 's quite a few who come here hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life .  and they 're all merchant marines . '
on whether the stories are all true .   if they are that 's a waterfall that spills over at high tide with a short drop to an underground lagoon .   if not 
are you sure ?   jack  this is not something you have to do . 
it 's the right way . 
the black pearl is a real ship . 
like i said there 's no real ship as can match  hey ! 
where did he come from ? 
an explosion in the powder magazine .  merchant vessels run heavily armed . 
dammit man it appears someone is stealing your ship ! 
you do n't have to give it to us because dr .  nebbleman can just cut it out of him . 
no . 
do ?   well i suppose that depends on you . 
ai n't it . 
did i ?   i 've been waiting for that for years . 
thank you sir . 
they also tried using viral r . n . a .  as the bonding element . 
yeah .   but it was n't a group .   it was one man . 
i hope you 're right .   i 'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just did n't care . 
dr .  argon would say we are all prisoners . 
no !   well not those exact words . 
who is n't ? 
so i guess it worked . 
the big house ? 
a cage by any other name would still smell like sweaty ugly men . 
i guess i should be flattered . 
we 'll see ?   what does that mean ? 
no something is really wrong .  .  .  look ! 
the nanobot . 
we do n't ? 
what happens ? 
means ?   oh no .   we wo n't know what it means until the end of the story and maybe then it wo n't seem quite as funny to you doctor frankenstein ! 
just giving credit where credit is due . 
blame the victim . 
victim my ass !   you stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage !   maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved ! 
this is what i deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists ? 
yeah .   old times . 
he believes that the second nanobot should be ready for testing by now . 
you wo n't .   that 's why you 're whispering . 
yes he might be . 
pipe down brain lady !   and you .  .  .

traffic tickets gone to warrant .  they stopped him for something found the warrants on im took im to jail .  she does n't want to walk around alone with all that weed .  well i do n't wanna do this i have a bad feeling about it but she keeps askin' me keeps askin' me finally i said okay cause i 'm sick of listening to it .  well we 're picking this guy up at the train station . 
mr .  brown ? 
it 's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy .  now granted that 's what true blue is about no argument about that . 
it hurts .  it hurts her .  it should n't hurt .  her pussy should be bubbleyum by now .  but when this cat fucks her it hurts .  it hurts like the first time .  the pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin .  hence like a virgin . 
give me my book . 
i 'm going to die !  i need a doctor !  i 'm begging you take me to a doctor . 
no i ca n't .  you know what i heard the other day ?  heartbeatit 's lovebeat by little tony defranco and the defranco family .  i have n't heard that since i was in fifth fuckin' grade . 
i do n't tip because society says i gotta .  i tip when somebody deserves a tip .  when somebody really puts forth an effort they deserve a little something extra .  but this tipping automatically that shit 's for the birds .  as far as i 'm concerned they 're just doin' their job . 
goddamn goddamn !  how did he die ? 
oh this is bad this is so bad .   is it bad ? 
what 's done is done i need you cool .  are you cool ? 
that 's not correct . 
shot my way out .  everybody was shooting so i just blasted my way outta there . 
i do n't buy it .  me and joe go back a long time .  i can tell ya straight up joe definitely did n't have anything to do with this bullshit . 
we ca n't take him to a hospital . 
well joe ai n't gettin' here .  we 're on our own .  now i do n't know a goddamn body who can help him so if you know somebody call em . 
so you wanna git bit huh ? 
you takin' his side ? 
fuck sides !  what we need is a little solidarity here .  somebody 's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand 's on the handle .  now i know i 'm no piece of shit .  .  .   and i 'm pretty sure you 're a good boy .  .  .   and i 'm fuckin positive you 're on the level .  so let 's figure out who 's the bad guy . 
what are you gonna do about him ? 
this is what he was doin' . 
look of things she does n't . 
i 'm clay phillips .   my brother steve . 
it 's a nice place owned by an old couple named wyatt . 
i 'm not in his shoes so leave me out of it . 
yeah . 
yeah .  while the horses wander all over the country . 
thanks . 
i 'll make the soap myself . 
oh it did .  it had a great deal to do with you . 
you do n't mean that clay . 
what does a man usually tell a girl ? 
i do n't expect anything .  a minute ago i had n't cuite waked up . 
morgan blood .  the beat in nevada .  clay and me have a place on the toulomne river .  we 're going to raise horses like these . 
i guess i have .  you were pretty little when they locked him up .  i do n't suppose you even remember that time i was gone two months . 
she told me not to fight with you anymore .  she said it was n't your fault but  i figure different .  .  . 
all right you did n't know . 
do n't ask me because i wo n't tell you !  i wo n't tell anybody !  go away ! 
but i want to stay . 
if she says anything to them i 'll kill her . 
the way you act it must be something pretty secret . 
then why stay in the hills . 
we tried to point that out .  but there were some pretty nosey citizens who would n't listen to reason .  they said aspen had outgrown us .  it 's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon . 
there 's still tomorrow morning . 
clay could save us an awful lot of time . 
how many ways can a man say no . 
because there 's a man i want to see . 
will you quit gabbin' and do what you 're told . 
oh this is too much .  i 'm gonna have to play these numbers .  remind me to pick up a lotto ticket . 
brenda are you okay ?  come sit . 
okay . 
yes of course uriah .  i feel his evil presence . 
but he could still be haunting the house .  he 's angry that he had to leave . 
yeah i think i 'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man . 
i meant you 're into ghosts . 
shhh ! 
wait i want to check something .  give me a hand . 
i was thinking the same thing . 
great !  !  ! 
huh ? 
no buddy i 'm the one he wants . 
oh . 
i think so . 
oh my god ray !  what are you doing here ? 
i am .  so just do me a favor and stay away from me . 
not in a thousand years . 
i 'll go . 
me and my friends .  .  .  you see there was this ghost .  he came out of nowhere and .  .  .  . 
as i am sure you are aware professor subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation which is of course why i 've given them special consideration . 
remember dwight not a word to anyone . 
right .  what about condoms ? 
let 's not forget folks this is a study on sleep disorders . 
yeah i can see that .  later i want you to teach me that trick but right now we have a job to do . 
hi . 
oh i could n't do that . 
yours or the turkeys ? 
not unless you have a paternity test to prove it . 
soon .  first i must bless this house . 
dog you look hot . 
shorty why do n't you say grace ? 
i am tom green i am tom green .  daddy want some sausage sausage .  daddy want some sausage .  .  . 
fucked me . 
no !   it was n't like gore movies at all !   it was real ! 
carl ca n't believe how much i make at swap meets . 
he certainly drives like a jerk . 
i 've identified every little birdie we 're going to watch tomorrow on the eastern shore . 
i just thought with all the sadness .  .  .  you would n't want .  .  . 
oohhhh eugene ! 
ooohhhh ! 
oohhhhh !  yeah !  yeah ! 
not at first but then i heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and i put two and two together . 
i beg your pardon ? 
who is this ? 
cocksucker !  
i did n't do it ! 
yes i did .  it 's terrifying !  the police were at my house this morning . 
who on earth would want to harass poor dottie hinkle ? 
i 'm not that bad a driver .   look at her hair !   turn it off honey . 
yes .  .  .  but .  .  .  i did n't .  .  . 
there is one big problem though . 
that girl was looking for jacqueline gibson .  i 'd forget it if i were you . 
you ca n't tell . 
i 'd like to get out of here . 
then you also understand that you must die . 
look mary now that i know you better i think i can be more frank with you .  i do n't believe you .  i still ca n't understand the reason for such a wild tale .  it 's like some of jacqueline 's stories . 
we 've tried so long to find her . 
perhaps later when things are settled when jacqueline 's well again  maybe we can arrange things differently . 
but i understand her .  that may be more important . 
yes .  and now that i 've shown you that i know that much and can guess more  will you trust me to look for jacqueline ? 
i went as a detective .  i found out that mrs .  redi reads the same books as dr .  judd . 
that 's it .  and this figure she traced it .  the book i saw at the library had been marked perfect by the library inspector in march .  mrs .  redi had it out in april .  no one else had read it since . 
it 's all clear to me now  so clear . 
he loves you mary and you 'll have to tell him . 
what 's wrong mary ? 
they may have been friends of hers . 
but you should make her laugh jason .  come make jokes for her .  i 'll bring your food to their table . 
well since you 're over twenty one
i 've lost my knack . 
after that wonderful first book  after all the adulation and the good reviews ? 
uhhuh . 
it sounds strange and i 'm going to be very wary . 
it goes beyond that .  it praises the goodness of god and the greatness of all his works . 
why not let your publisher judge that ? 
cloven hoof ? 
i think i can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation .  i know too much .  i was jacqueline 's psychoanalyst . 
yes .  there are certain punitive measures .  .  . 
i can imagine .  but you did say you came to me as my friend that you were concerned for me . 
are we ? i thought i was very gay . 
life has betrayed us .  we 've found there is no heaven on earth so we must worship evil for evil 's own sake .  we 're not wicked .  we commit no violence unless .  .  . 
unless what ? 
oh .  well i did .  i was in a band once and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible . 
anyway i think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned . 
nine years ? 
younger . 
are n't you ? 
excuse me for asking but how would you know ? 
i just wanted to see how the place looked furnished . 
not much to see i 'm afraid .  i 'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe . 
can we look at one ? 
maybe you want to go . 
do you want me to stop ? 
yes . 
if i asked you to would you ?  not on tape i mean ? 
no . 
no . 
i do n't know .  it all gets back to that cynthia thing .  i do n't like her .  .  .  eagerness .  there 's nothing left to imagine there 's no .  .  . 
i 'm babbling . 
you should be .  he lied to you .  so did cynthia . 
so why wo n't you make love with me ?  why would n't you i mean ? 
i 'm asking for real .  i want you to turn that camera off and make love with me .  will you ? 
not entirely . 
but that was part of it ? 
yes . 
as i said i have n't decided what to do exactly .  perhaps i wo n't do anything . 
oh you just moved here to think about it right ? 
jesus christ ann .  why is anybody anything ?  i think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad and you do n't allow for any gray areas and that 's what most of us consist of . 
jesus christ where 'd that come from ?  i have a late lunch by myself and now i 'm fucking somebody ? 
if i 'm right i want to know .  i do n't want you to lie .  i 'd be very upset but not as upset as if i 'd found out you 'd been lying . 
i was just saying you know ?  i did n't get paranoid when you did n't want to make love .  i could have easily assumed that you did n't want to because you were having an affair . 
but i 'm not . 
why do n't i believe you ? 
i do n't know .  sometimes i feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world . 
i want out of this marriage . 
yes ! 
yes . 
what upsets you about that ? 
nope . 
i think you 're right .  so come on i came all the way over here to find out what got ann so spooked tell me what happened . 
why do n't you let me tape you ? 
nothing . 
no .  he kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer and then his family moved away .  to cleveland actually . 
if you wish .   you 're not wearing any underwear . 
do you like the way i look ? 
yes . 
hi . 
no .  you 'll have to get somebody else . 
i 'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer . 
how about if you record over the one we already made ?  you could have the same date and not use another tape .  who would know ? 
i 'm sorry .  i ca n't do it . 
i only get one today ?  gee how exciting . 
why ? 
i hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time . 
no i mean doing it at my house . 
you should be .  can i meet this friend of yours ? 
does n't work .  he has to know the people he has to be able to interact with them . 
why not ? 
you realize you have no recourse legally ?  this stuff could show up anywhere . 
it wo n't .  i trust him . 
actually no i 've changed my mind .  i should n't have called . 
who ? 
what do you mean ? 
what tapes ? 
john as a lawyer you should know that those tapes are private property . 
brian kirkland please . 
anyway i 've always said the work is the thing .  i can be happy without a marriage but take away my work that 's different .  and if ann ca n't handle that that 's her problem like we re all alone in this world you know what i 'm saying ?  i mean fuck .   jesus what 's takin' this guy ? 
well look .  how 's this ?  you go on down to the clinic and tell that nice dr .  st .  luc .  .  .    .  .  . you tell him that nick 's ill he 's got these lumps and he ca n't get out of bed .  tell him to come when you 're sure nick 'll be home .  and do n't tell nick anything .  let the two of them fight it out . 
make love to me nine ?  i want you to make love to me .  please please make love to me . 
i see .  then what brought you up here ? 
meeting rollo at tudor 's .  might take a while . 
i wo n't be at the office except to sign in .   i 've got a lot of claims to check out .  all over the place .  garages and more garages .   i 'll come home right after work . 
well let 's wait for the xrays . 
it 's no use pussyfooting around janet  we have to cut quick and deep . 
sponsor !  !  ! 
sold ?  ?  !  ! 
who trusts experts ? 
overreact !   you 're the one with theories about conspirac .  .  .   oliver ? 
are you spoken for this evening ? 
what are you trying to do ?   make bert look like a fool ?   he 's made all the arrangements . 
some people do it for the fashion
you lost your baby when you lost your balls you 've lost your mind you 've lost your grip so say byebye
you 've lost your heart
you 've lost your cause
some people do it for for improvement
he was adopted you know .

he 's a lame dog remember ?   but even he would n't want to see you like this . 
i know .

janet !   where 's that lovely dress i made you ? 
thanks officer park .  .  . vance .

i 'm worried about you miles .  do you need some money ? 
stephanie . 
i do n't know .  senior editor ?  sounds like you 're in to me . 
it 's a long shot all right ?  and conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway .  i 'm not getting my hopes up .  i 've stopped caring .  that 's it .  i 've stopped caring . 
sure is tasty . 
it 's not worth it .  you pay too big a price .  it 's never free . 
what color is it supposed to be ? 
i do n't know .  wine ?  fermented grapes ? 
when do we get to drink it ? 
not with the wine list these people have .  we do n't want to hold back . 
you think i 'm making a mistake marrying christine ? 
whoa . 
yeah .  it 's good .  feels good . 
she is very hot . 
and she likes pinot . 
well i 'm tired .  are n't you tired ? 
now i 've got another lie to live down .  thanks jack . 
how do you know ? 
she probably went home lit some candles put on some relaxing music took a nice hot bath and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator . 
okay okay .  relax miles jesus .  no merlot .  did you bring your xanax ? 
with maya . 
i said okay ? 
huh . 
what ? 
wow .  okay .  calm down .  sorry . 
who 's being selfish now ?  i 'm the one getting married .  i thought this week was supposed to be about me . 
we gotta slow down .   i 'm so tired .  let 's just get out of here . 
are they too sporty ? 
you ever actually been in there miles ? 
i do n't have to . 
see ?  right there .  just what you just said .  that 's beautiful .  a thumbprint on a skyscraper .  i could n't write that . 
gonna fuck that up too .  i should sue her ass .  only reason i wo n't is to protect christine . 
uhhuh . 
you 're joking right ?   what are you doing ?  unfucking believeable .  can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home ? 
okay so they were in your wallet and you left your wallet somewhere .  some bar .  christine 'll understand . 
my ankle .  just go explain the situation . 
hey why do n't you invite maya to the wedding ? 
you 're so negative . 
what the fuck ! 
you need a new car anyway . 
on a sauvignon blanc ? 
oh yeah .  steph 's way into pinots and syrahs .   hey steph ?  you sure we can open anything ?  anything we want ? 
what was the bottle that did it ? 
what 's the title ? 
horticulture ?  wow .  i did n't know there was a college here . 
why are you so into pinot ?  it 's like a thing with you . 
great .  what 's the latest we can get there ? 
he 's an actor so it ca n't be good . 
but you wanted to fuck me first . 
it 's miles .  listen i do n't know if you even care but i had to call and tell you again how much i enjoyed our time together and how sorry i am things turned out the way they did .  i think you 're great maya  always have .  from the first time you waited on me .   and while i 'm at it i guess you should know that my book is not getting published .  i thought this one had a chance but i was wrong .  again .  do n't bother reading it  you 've got better things to do .  so you see i 'm not much of a writer .  i 'm not anything really .  the only real talent i seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand .  we 're leaving in the morning and i want you to know that i take with me wonderful memories of you .  i 'm sorry .  i 'm really sorry . 
miles maybe it is better if you do n't come to the wedding . 
back to the drawing board i guess .  or not .  so .  .  .  you 're married .  congratulations .  you look happy . 
oh .  huh .  well .  .  .   congratulations again vicki .  that 's wonderful news . 
about a year . 
you do n't even know what that word means . 
i do n't feel much . 
 .  .  . i will . 
what ?   colleen ?  .  .  .  colleen ? 
it 's called probing .  it 's a military procedure .  you send a reconnaissance group very small to check out things .  not to engage but to evaluate the situation .  evaluate the level of danger .  make sure things are all clear .  .  . 
boy why are n't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of t and a ? 
it 's broken morgan .  it 'll just keep doing this .   let 's get out of the car okay ? 
yes . 
how can you say that ? 
he was trying to eat a second chocolate bar .  your grandma said no .  he tried to take a bite so i grabbed it . 
me too . 
oh . 
bimboo ? 
yes .  they would invade us using only ground tactics .  hand to hand combat .  they would n't use their technology or fight an airborne battle because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them . 
did it seem short to you ? 
sounds good . 
yeah .  .  .  maybe .  so long . 
so far that 's all i seen in this life . 
is he alive ? 
i guess i put a good scare into him . 
you must have known that before you came . 
it 's one thing to know it .  .  . 
this time you 're really going ?   you know where i 'll be . 
and they were two of them .  look 
i want you out of town before the hanging . 
i 'll be long gone . 
south of here past chimayo . 
i expect . 
bad luck for me .  now i gotta bust him out of there . 
you have n't got any money . 
all right you buy me a drink . 
anybody got any ideas ? 
i saw the light .  i thought maybe rae had come back to see me .  but i never thought it 'd be my boy .  i never thought that . 
what about the law ? 
tomorrow we 're going to town to straighten that out once and for all .  the next day we 'll be back here .  .  .  farming .  and these cattle better be gone . 
i do n't believe in luck .  i know what conrad was like .  do n't tell me what you think i want to hear . 
what 's that ? 
i want to build something make things grow .  that takes hard work  a lifetime of it .  that 's not why men come to a pretty woman . 
we did n't get that far . 
who is he ? 
all i did was kiss the girl . 
what 's the matter paden ?  you afraid i could n't get those two behind me ? 
i 'm done talking .  get out . 
i decide what 's right in this jurisdiction .  now move . 
so this is the guy you 're going to hang ? 
they 're watching the hollis place .  i ca n't get through . 
what makes you think i could ? 
who 's the owner ? 
oh no .   the fan club is real .   but they were worshipping computer code  ones and zeros . 
who ? 
why do n't you just come clean viktor ?   tell the truth .   you 'll feel better afterwards . 
i 'm not   he 's not . 
goodbye . 
please . 
spare me . 
good to see you too elaine . 
why is n't she with you ? 
why ?   because she would never show up at something like this .   she 's intensely private . 
almost right . 
out of the question .   a circus like that ? 
no problem .   do you want to come in ? 
if it 's on the page .  .  . 
al least a contingency for wardrobe .   any woman can go up a dress size . 
well we have to do something about this  stuntwoman . 
simone does not control my destiny . 
thank you .   what did you think lainey ? 
that 's genius viktor .   was that simone 's idea ? 
excuse me ?   start ? 
when is she coming over ? 
i just read somewhere 
who says that   ?    never mind .   you have to listen to me elaine .   simone is thin air pixels molded by me from a mathematical equation .   i inherited it from a madman  i can show you 
you 're drunker than i thought .   are you doing that again ? 
right beside you .   i borrowed viktor 's car . 
sometimes .   but just when i think your father 's changing for the better i realize he 's as self absorbed as ever .   he took the credit for simone tonight . 
 we do n't believe daddy because we do n't want to believe we were taken in too . 
of course . 
what i do to simone ? 
simone ? 
i just think actors talk too much .  does the world really want to hear your life story just because you 've got a movie opening friday ? 
who are you really ? 
that 's a good question .   as nietzsche said whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else .  .  . 
how about the nudity ? 
i suppose the thing i like most about the movies i 'm in is that they 're not about special effects . 
we all do .   but now i understand you 're eager to get back to work  and not the kind of work that we 're all expecting . 
 i know i do n't know anything . 
i know hal is as stiff as always . 
you know me  married to my work . 
too impersonal .   they have to meet facetoface . 
i 'll see what i can do .   you know lainey .   i do n't believe you 've ever once asked to meet simone .   do n't you like her ? 
no that was me . 
me and simone .   what i did . 
i could get the death penalty . 
she was never in new mexico .   she never left the studio . 
i know that 's what you 'd like us to believe .   but i got to tell you  embezzlement is a serious matter .  not to mention abduction . 
she looks a lot like you . 
i do ?   sure i do .   can we speak off the record ?   i 'm a fair man .   i 'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story . 
do n't you ? 
which means they 're significant .   incriminating .   perhaps criminal .   she 's hiding her past .   she 's hiding her past . 
taller viktor . 
after i saw what simone did with the role  you know i fired all my people went into rehab took acting classes changed my whole look .   she really inspired me . 
thank you . 
yes .   yes i 'm going to tell the truth about you why would n't i .  .  .  ?   of course with hank 's tragic passing the secret died with him .   i am going to tell the truth .  .  .  after your next picture . 
not eternity forever ?   the legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made ?   i 'd kill for that part . 
i was hoping you 'd say that . 
okay .  fine .  understood .   i 'm off then . 
nothing bad can happen in a church right ? 
i guess they do n't . 
he your best buddy ? 
we 're not gonna start crying again are we ? 
i guess she did . 
where will you go where no one has died ? 
and you know what else ? 
you 'd cry .  cause you miss grandma so much . 
that 's right .  so why do you take it sweetheart ? 
sometimes people think they lose things and they did n't really lose them .  it just gets moved . 
standing next to my window . 
they want me to do things for them . 
i wish i could be like my momma though .  she always knew what was wrong .  knew just what to say . 
what 's a little while ?

you could 've asked . 
you might have said no .  i have trouble handling rejection . 
yeah it 's tough when your cheek bones are your main asset . 
i guess if there 's one lesson i 've learned it 's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target .   i forgot your question ? 
the minute you see him you 'll know . 
they 're jammed ! 
what 's your twenty ? 
as far as john law knows i 'm just a joy ridin' georgia redneck .  we keep em outta your backyard we 're cool .   now just give me five to ditch this idiot and i 'll meet you in ole miss .

yeah m 'brothers .  .  .  they did n't make it . 
buddy i 'm not an ethics professor i 'm a physician be honest or be dead within a day .  .  .  s 'your choice . 
there are certain meds certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you 've done but i 'd have to administer them myself . 
no .  sorry comes later when you 're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis .  sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection sorry 
get in here goddammit ! 
his testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what 's left of the la cosa nostra is this country .  that alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with witness protection . 
 your intel corroborates what we already know .  sparazza 's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny it seems he wants one last thing .  .  .  the heart of his sworn enemy .  a recently opened cash rich escrow account has been traced back to sparazza .  this and the mention of this mysterious swede makes the million dollar contract on israel very real . 
 you can and you will . 
yes .  the actual contract went to lazlo soot the man that plunged to his death from the penthouse yesterday .  he was to neutralize israel 's entourage and prep for the removal of his heart .  ingstrom was to handle the surgery itself onsite with the assistance of dr .  gregory gill israel 's personal physician who was also on the sparazza payroll . 
 .  .  . yeah fiftythree . 
i would n't go that far . 
 we needed cohesion to move forward .  not conjecture . 
yeah y 'ai n't heard the punchline yet and before i get to it one more thing i heard little curious should probably bring it up .  .  .  primo wants israel 's heart .  the actual thing the organ . 
 who can say .  he 's off his onion y 'know he 's old school sicilian this is how they hate . 
no shit . 
cold blood sid dead eyes y 'know ? 
how are we on time .  .  .  ? 
you know i did baby .  .  .   and a deep dark one at that .  now if you ai n't a dog which you do n't look like 
 never in a million girl 
i probably woulda busted on you too .  .  .  and what a shame that woulda been . 
hold up hold up i 'm getting shots over the scanners tons of traffic  jus' chill for a sec lemme listen .  .  .

you 'll end up like me . 
what ? 
kelvin if you see anything unusual .  .  . 
and professionally ? 
an enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project .  we are in little danger of being left alone for long .   you 'll need to do something .  otherwise they 'll be sending someone out to recover you . 
gibarian said he thinks solaris should be destroyed . 
what is it ? 
why ? 
consciousness is enough that 's all i 've saying .   consciousness should be enough for anybody . 
sartorius .

she met some friend of aunt millie 's who works for a record company .   he thinks she 's got a great voice . 
that 's not even close . 
right . 
you make your own luck parker !  get into the middle of things spend every day pounding the pavement of the city 's mean streets
mr .  jameson
i see .   so amazing spiderman i 'll assume that 's not your given name
well .  .  . 
even if you 've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written . 
i hate people with alliterative names . 
you should write that one down . 
i 've gotta study . 
you 're not trained for that .   none of us are .  .  .  i mean sometimes i .  .  .   okay let 's say you had gone back .  what then ?   are you bulletproof ? 
am i ?   i 'm not so sure .   i used to be sure of a lot of things .   oh different things from week to week but now i 'm not sure of anything anymore . 
strong .  .  . 
hello .   so very boring .   peter parker how do you feel about me this morning ? 
why ? 
but you said he went off a little after the accident when those mechanical arms
right .  we have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men .  with the waldos . 
einstein right ?   we 'll see ya . 
i was napping on the couch .   there was a voice and a shot .   i woke up .  ben was looking at me . 
hi .   i 've got sort of a hypothetical question .   do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider 's proportional strength and agility ? 
truth .  pure eternal .   beyond the boundaries of mere mortality . 
no .  it is n't . 
truth .   truth alone exists .  truth must be released .  .  . 
no thank you .   i 'm sure you 've got your own problems . 
anybody here wanna double their bet ? 
okay security  what happened ? 
you 'd better get that blue blood circulating because we 're busting out of this stinkhole in exactly    one minute and twenty seconds . 
yeah . 
i 'm okay here .  why bother ? 
how could i have had a time bomb ?  they searched me when they took me prisoner . 
naturally .  it would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk . 
i want to talk about lieutenant dunbar .  is this lieutenant dunbar ? 
it 's a mouse trap . 
stop it harry ! 
i said say it again .  i did n't say repeat it . 
you 're teasing me again ! 
no .  your eyeball goes .  the top of your head .  gotta wind up with athlete 's stomach . 
plant it animal and grow us a chicken for christmas . 
come on baby !  daddy 's going to buy you a hunk of cheese ! 
kill it duke .  it 's got us all spinning . 
answer the question .  how do you rate all those privileges ? 
just as you say hoffy .  but would n't it be smarter if i went out and kept schulz tied up ? 
one more thing gentlemen .  the kommandant told me to pick up the radio . 
the one you are hiding in the barrack do n't you know ?  the one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound . 
says who ? 
says me . 
lay off i said  if you do n't want your head handed to you . 
okay then .  put a guard on me .  i want you to put a guard on me .  because if anything goes wrong out there this time you wo n't have a patsy .  right ? 
so who stays with me ?  maybe joey ?  no  not joey .  would n't you feel safer with security on the job ? 
you did ! 
you off your rocker ? 
he 's a nazi price is .  for all i know his name is preismaier or preissinger .  sure he lived in cleveland but when the war broke out he came back to the fatherland like a good little bundist .  he spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school gave him phony dogtags 
thirtyfifth . 
three hundred and sixtyfifth bomb squadron ?  out of chelveston ? 
will you get this guy out of my hair so i can go ? 
we have no radio . 
all right gentlemen i will find it myself .  now let 's see . 
wie hat er 's gemacht ? 
fine  fine ! 
you americans !  you are the craziest people !  that 's why i like you !  i wish i could invite you all to my house for a nice german christmas ! 
who 's the guy schulz ? 
why do n't we just plug up that tunnel  with the kommandant on one end and you on the other . 
the kommandant also sends you clean blankets .  he wants every man to have a new clean blanket . 
agreed . 
you get what ? 
we all are data .  but we 're going to get him back . 
i hope so sir . 
the ships are bearing at 310 mark 215 .  distance three light years . 
yeah .  they 're great are n't they ?  you can go back and see them born go forward and see your grandchildren .  time has no meaning here . 
i do n't understand . 
i ca n't leave .  i 'm already there remember ? 
yes yes it is . 
you 're a starfleet officer and you have a duty to
better ? 
i had n't planned on it . 
that 's right . 
least i could do for a captain of the enterprise . 
it 's like you always said if something 's important enough you make the time . 
i thought you might . 
an antimatter discharge directly ahead8a it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away . 
load torpedo bays prepare to fire on my command . 
thank you number one . 
sir is there anything wrong ? 
how is that possible ? 
too big .  how long until the ribbon arrives ? 
all right all right .  you 've made your point . 
we 're doing the best we can .  now if you 'll excuse me .  .  . 
nothing .  as before . 
could be grissom .   patch in the hailing frequency .   u . s . s .  grissom this is enterprise calling .  come in please . 
scotty .  .  .  ? 
oh no you do n't !  regulations specifically state nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated .  can you guarantee that ? 
not from here no . 
david .  .  .  sorry i 'm late . 
david !  .  .  .  what went wrong ? 
 .  .  .  fascinating . 
all the varieties of land and weather known to earth within a few hours walk ! 
there 's only one thing it could be .  .  .  short range scan . 
 .  .  .  or uwhou . 
not exactly . 
and spock with it .  they are joined together . 
days .  .  .  maybe hours .  .  .  protomatter has made the situation unpredictable .   i 'm sorry . 
pon farr .  vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life . 
i 'll go .  .  . 
your timing is excellent mr .  scott .  you 've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home .  how much refit time till we can take her out again ? 
aye sir ! 
bones help spock !  everyone else find a station ! 
he is not himself  but he lives .  he is subject to rapid aging  like this unstable planet . 
but we have spock alive !  that 's more than we bargained for ! 
yes sir .  it 's getting larger as we close in . 
go sulu ! 
then how 
 .  .  .  yes .  .  . 
 .  .  .  the needs of the few .  .  . 
 .  .  .  or the one . 
what must i do ? 
great power .  .  .  to control .  .  .  dominate .  .  .  destroy .  if it works . 
understood my lord . 
sir may i 
a twenty year space veteran yet you ask for the worst duty station in town .  i mean look at this place the hind end of space . 
but it 's damn irregular .  no destination orders no encoded i . d .  .  . 
this is n't reality .  this is fantasy . 
it 's new  have you any idea what you 're saying ? 
that 's all you have to say ? 
thank you . 
there may still be time .  .  .  you gave as good as you got . 
how can you think of food at a time like this ? 
it 's like the garden of eden .  .  . 
i 'm taking this bunch to sick bay . 
commander we are receiving .  this is regula i .  go ahead . 
we have received new orders .  upon our arrival at regula i all materials of project genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at ceti alpha vi . 
i 'm sorry you feel that way doctor .  admiral kirk 's orders are confirmed .  please prepare to deliver genesis to us upon our arrival .  reliant out . 
repeat .  .  .  what 's wrong ?  what 's wrong ? 
stage one of our experiments was conducted in the labora tory .  stage two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground stage three will involve the process on a plane tary scale .  what follows is a computer projected simulation of stage three .  please watch closely . 
par for the course .  .  .  you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner ? 
go back .  i 'm going to kill him . 
you do that and you 'll have murdered your father . 
but we ca n't just sit here   ! 
i suppose it ucouldu be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix .  .  . 
uwe were still thereu you dumb bastard !  we could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room 
what is the meaning of this attack ?  where is the crew of the reliant ? 
khan listen to me  if its me you want i 'll have myself beamed aboard .  all i ask is that you spare my crew . 
i 've given you no word to keep admiral .  in my judgment you simply have no alternative . 
aye sir . 
just the batteries sir .  i can have auxiliary power in a few minutes 
right on schedule admiral .  just give us your coordinates and we 'll beam you aboard . 
i see .  well shall we start with the engine room ? 
home . 
how far ? 
give up genesis she said .  what in god 's name does that mean ?  give it up to whom ? 
chekov 's on reliant is n't he ? 
who ?  who knew just where to hit us ?  and uwhyu ? 
damn .  alert starfleet headquarters .  i want to talk with starfleet command . 
as i indicated admiral that thought had not occurred to me . 
engage warp engines 
trying sir ! 
try again . 
course heading captain ? 
no power to the weapons system sir . 
aye sir . 
you are half human .  the computer knows that . 
where must you go ? 
you do this  for friendship ? 
do n't tell me fish stories kiddo .  i 've known you too long . 
mr .  sulu .  .  .  take us home .  .  . 
would you prefer to do nothing ? 
if you have a better idea  now 's the time . 
captain spock and i will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source . 
there are millions of other species on earth doctor .  only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man . 
that 's crazy !  who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale ? 
acceleration is no longer a constant . 
guess spock .  your best guess . 
guessing is not in my nature .  .  . 
reading the patient 's vital signs . 
a simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure . 
yes under u . s .  government .  now we need directions . 
i have the coordinates of the reactor .  .  . 
name ? 
no umyu name . 
we are in an enemy wessel sir .  i did n't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral . 
then 
very likely .  you 're not exactly catching us at our best . 
how will that be done exactly ? 
 .  .  .  who are you ? 
who do you think i am ? 
then tell me when the whales are leaving . 
noon tomorrow .  .  .  ?  ! 
it would n't be my first choice no . 
lemme tell you something .  i 'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd century .  if i have to i 'll go to the open sea to get them but i 'd just as soon take yours  better for me better for you .  .  .  and better for them . 
i bet you 're a damn good poker player . 
do n't worry .  i 'll find uyouu .   see you around the galaxy .  .  . 
uhura .  .  .  can you modify the probe 's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors ? 
as suspected the probe 's transmissions are the songs sung by whales . 
i have . 
nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels .  .  . 
yes ? 
i believe i was successful in communicating our intentions . 
admiral you must wait one damn minute . 
 .  .  .  aye sir .  .  .  ? 
yes sir . 
out of control and blind as a bat ! 
appreciated by all mr .  scott .   prepare for departure . 
well that 's different . 
that 's easy 6 inches .  we carry stuff that big in stock . 
 .  .  .  but it would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix .  .  .  ! 
oh here and there .   i flew something similar in my academy days . 
you 'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday .  .  .  stop planning for tomorrow .  .  .  until you find .  .  .   let me ask you a question  have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time ? 
yes .  exactly .  nothing more complicated than perception .   you explore the universe .  we 've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself .  .  .  full of powerful forces .  .  .  most people are n't aware enough of the now .  .  .  to ever notice them .  .  . 
it took us centuries to learn that it does n't have to take centuries to learn . 
i do n't . 
data .  .  .  have n't you ever just played .  .  .  for fun ? 
if you want to know what it 's like to be a child' you need to learn how to play .  .  . 
wo n't he rust ? 
the artificial lifeform was right ? 
and our people ? 
not at all .  they 're fine .  .  .  in fact they 're better than fine .  increased metabolism high energy improved muscle tone .  we should all be so lucky . 
'yewcheen cheffaw' .  .  .  my collar size is exactly the same as it was at the academy . 
what 's the last thing you remember data .  .  . 
from the mission .  .  . 
it 's nothing personal data .  you have to remember these people have rejected technology .  and you .  .  . 
'just a few loose ends to tie up . '
federation support federation procedures federation rules .  .  .  look in the mirror admiral .  .  .  the federation is old .  .  .  in the last twenty four months it 's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant  the borg the cardassians the dominion .  .  .  they all smell the scent of death on the federation .  that 's why you 've embraced our offer .  .  .  because it will give your dear federation new life .  well how badly do you want it admiral ?  because there are hard choices to be made now .  if the enterprise gets through with news about their brave captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless ba 'ku your federation politicians will waver your federation opinion polls will open a public debate your federation allies will want their say .  .  .  need i go on ? 
good luck .  dougherty out . 
that 's why we put chromodynamic shields in place  so our people would n't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation .  .  . 
how can there be an order to abandon the prime directive .  .  .  ? 
with metaphasics lifespans will be doubled .  .  .  an entire new medical science will evolve .  .  .   i understand your chief engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life .  .  .  would you take his sight away from him ? 
cometary debris pockets of unstable metreon gas .  .  .  we do n't want to go in there sir .  .  . 
we 're not going anywhere . 
slow to impulse .  we 're on our way . 
no sir .  i have n't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since i 've been back .  .  . 
transferring controls to manual . 
debrief them again .   have you been in a fight commander ? 
yewcheen cheffaw .  .  .  emphasis on the cheen' and the faw' .  .  . 
environmental concerns again .  an android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind .  .  . 
you should feel right at home with them . 
you 're in luck .  .  .  it says here they 've taken women from several races as indentured servants . 
if that 's true they 're a dying race . 
augh ? 
yes .  .  . 
it may not be that simple .  this is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history . 
i 'm saying they might shoot us on sight .  you have to remember .  .  .  these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them . 
i 'll be fine .   he 's a different story . 
how did doctor almack react to that ? 
i am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before .  as an android i am in complete control of my neural net .  the information contained there cannot be forcibly removed . 
i am the borg . 
power .  there has n't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks .  most of the batteries are depleted . 
i have the password right here . 
can you reconstruct the throttle valve ? 
always am . 
this is picard .  i 've suspended the launch sequence . 
it 'll have to wait .  come on . 
initiate preignition sequence . 
yes . 
and you know all this .  .  .  because uyou 'reu a spaceman too .  .  . 
it ca n't wait until tomorrow .  .  . 
friends from cornell .  .  . 
a key piece of the ship has been destroyed .  .  .  and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like . 
i am not a thief .  .  . 
onscreen . 
life signs ? 
i 'll bear it in mind admiral .  i think that 's all . 
i 'm going too .  they may need a doctor . 
stand .  .  .  ? 
that 's a comfort .  .  . 
i beg your pardon ? 
you feign ignorance ? 
that we fired two photon torpedoes .  but 
louder please .  we cannot hear you . 
i am . 
i ca n't make it alone .  you 're the likeliest candidate to come to this godforsaken place in months . 
candidate for what ? 
captain if 
who else .  .  .  ? 
captain may i remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock ? 
sir ? 
thank you captain sulu . 
do n't mention it captain kirk . 
you have personally 
we are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation . 
from enterprise ? 
he was just about to explain the whole damn 
what peace conference ? 
the night is young .  anyway it was logical .   you know you 're a great one for logic .  i 'm a great one for  rushing in where angels fear to tread .  we 're both extremists .  reality is probably somewhere in between us . 
we surrender . 
this is enterprise .  we surrender .  repeat  enterprise surrenders 
nothing captain .  if they 're here they 're rigger for silent running . 
sir i speak to you as a kindred intellect .  do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the federation ? 
that the universe will unfold as it should . 
you ca n't prove any of this .  .  . 
i do not think so .  enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts .  admiral donald will make certain all your shipto shore transmissions are jammed . 
what ? 
no sir . 
mr .  scott you forget yourself .  please accompany me . 
yet the data banks insist we fired twice .  one computer is lying . 
i think  not . 
nevertheless . 
i know precisely where he 'll be . 
thank you mr .  scott .  we were to return to spacedock the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear . 
about twentyfive years ago .  they probably used a hair follicle or skin cell . 
that was another time . 
well .  i suppose it does a bit .  i 'm very happy for them of course but i 'm going to miss them .  the ship will seem .  .  .  incomplete without them . 
that is because you have a familiarity with them .  you can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge . 
yes .  and frankly i envy them as well .  they 've made important choices they 're going to have great challenges ahead of them .  new worlds to conquer .  .  . 
while i find that fascinating data we really need that goddamned door open ! 
fire ! 
he may have already rejected my humanity but you also have a twin
because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle . 
do you have a moment sir ? 
understood . 
thank you commander . 
there 's something else .  i was reviewing the sensor logs . 
what if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack ? 
on my way .  please notify commander riker . 
the praetor 's power has always been the romulan fleet .  they must be behind him . 
his hatred of the federation is apparent .  he would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason .  he is going after earth . 
anything . 
i would be interested to know what we are talking about . 
yes .  the eyes have it . 
no race should be a slave to another . 
there 's so much and so much of it is dull .  .  . 
new worlds . 
what 's this all about ? 
it 's about destiny picard .  about a reman outcast who .  .  . 
and i 'm not quite human .  so what am i ?  what do you see ?   do you see a life you might have led ?  lost youth never to be recaptured ? 
you can still make a choice !  make the right one now ! 
do n't you think it 's time to surrender ?  i 'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces .  why should the rest of your crew have to die ? 
he 's a very unusual android . 
seven minutes . 
they will obey praetor . 
and when i return .  .  .  you and i shall have a little talk about showing proper respect ! 
there is .  they came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses . 
it 's taken on a disguise . 
you 're not hearing me . 
no we do n't . 
you 're a career intelligence officer shermin .  you 'll be in the air with us . 
you can speak to me mrs .  haydn .  i 'm in charge of this operation now . 
you 've been through quite an ordeal mrs .  haydn .  why do n't you stay where you are and let us pick you up ?  we 'll fly you home . 
no .  you 'll want to ask a lot of questions i do n't want to answer right now .  i already have a ride . 
gear shift . 
dashboard . 
good . 
that way . 
smile .  .  .  good ? 
it 's closed .  .  .  closed .  we need one that 's open . 
are you from up there ?  space ? 
no . 
no . 
horses . 
how many days and nights do you have to go .  .  .    .  .  . here ? 
that 's not much time .  i 'll just slow you down .  i have to sleep .  i 'm very tired .  and i have to wash and eat .  you do n't .  .  . 
no . 
no . 
why ? 
what is hitchhike ? 
but i speak english . 
yes . 
then do n't be smart . 
no . 
no .  my ship was doing a map of all the suns and .  .  . 
the captain .  .  . 
i do n't know . 
yes .  sing some more . 
where ? 
i 'm never going to see you again am i ? 
i will . 
it 's easier not to tell if you do n't know . 
no . 
no sir .  radar . 
we better get it into the box .  come on .  .  . 
it was the husband .  the police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman . 
i do n't understand . 
no . 
well maybe these men wo n't think so .  we were asleep when a helicopter woke me up .  it made me so nervous i went into the kitchen for something to eat .  i happened to look out the window and there was scott haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling jenny down the walk to the car . 
i would n't think so . 
i do n't want to hurt anybody .  i just want to go home . 
bullshit politics . 
easy eduardo easy .   preserve a sense of humor at all times .   okay the receptor rig .  .  .  what i 'm putting on your head .  .  .  sends a signal to the recorder .   see we call it being wired but there 's no wire .   you gotta keep the recorder close .  .  .  five six feet away max like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you 're going to close escrow know what i mean ?

jesus ! 
naawww . 
yeah but how 'd it get to you ? 
so lay it off to somebody else . 
hey you 're always saying bring me real life .   bring me street life .  and like one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's technicolor . '
i said that ?   look i 'll take it for five and you 'll make out okay because in this case it 's pure cream you do n't have to cut anything back to the wearer . 
who was just here ? 
iris man .   pay attention . 
wait wait .  .  .  wait a minute .   iris was here ?  ! 
i always do . 
they jerked my wheels d 'you believe it ?   i mean it 's outrageous the computer errors the banks are making lately .   have you noticed ? 
way i look at it i actually perform a humanitarian service .   i save lives . 
get it . 
you still like me do n't you ?   we 're still buddies ? 
sure lenny .   the only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love . 
wants to share . 
it 's not your fault . 
no it does n't . 
and what about the guy that was following me ? 
now you 're really getting paranoid . 
no shit .   you got someplace in mind ? 
fire 's out is n't it ? 
i ca n't tell you .   you 've got to see . 
deputy commissioner palmer strickland .   the sanctimonious prick who busted me out .   his ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it .   i know this guy .   if there 's one cop who 's not dirty it 's him . 
i guess . 
the bearded guy the creep .  oh one other thing .  testa if that 's his name he kept mentioning my feet .  said i had very pretty feet . 
yeah . 
down the road a piece is the golden sunset the notell motel socorro 's contribution to international relations .  the car 's just sitting there no activity .  i 've had a couple hispanic officers casing it all day .  want to take a look ? 
let 's take a look . 
oh yes i see .  you must get asked this a lot . 
yeah . 
i did n't wait on him .  fifty or so white regular build needed a shave  that 's all i remember . 
put a bolo out on that . 
agent kulok and i were in o 'hare when we heard . 
he got away .  i had him .  he got away . 
you did n't like anyone looking over your shoulder  why was that ?  what were you doing ? 
i 'm hesitant to .  .  . 
that gasbag .  i can imagine what he said .  i 'm not ashamed to admit that most of what i know about criminal profiling started with richard low .  i have also over the years i admit taken credit for many of his accomplishments .  he was the most brilliant law enforcement individual i ever met . 
both in the last year .  i suspected only someone as brilliant as dick low could find these guys .   look whatever daitz told you nobody wanted to strip richard of his badge .  you have to get close to be good at what he did the trick is not to get too close . 
i suspected but you were the one low contacted .  that 's why i brought you back here . 
collected shoes too ? 
huh ?  sir . 
in ft .  myers before your instruction .  nowhere else sir . 
i understand . 
we 'll wait .  get online with low inform him of zero 's route  we 'll set a trap for him . 
suspect zero now there 's an idea that does n't look good on paper 
shut the fuck up or i 'll shut you up . 
why did he come out here ?  what 's going on ? 
a very sexy case . 
people end up in occupations for a reason .  they may think not but they do occupations define us . 
take it to the next level .  what are his fantasies what turns him on what kind of pornography does he like ?  if he could act out his fantasies what would he do ?  imagine yourself one of his victims realizing your life is in his hands .  what is he thinking ? 
that 's because he 's a fucking wacko .  never met a selfpromotion scheme he did n't like .  what 's he doing now ? 
when you were his student ?  did he come on to you ? 
he 's called a couple times . 
when you exit head east on 10th . 
deputy director koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope risking highprofile failure .  better to get rid of me .  then he could be mr .  serial killer mr .  authority on deviant behavior  no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one richard low .  do you really think that plane crashed by accident ?  do you really think i was n't on it by accident ?  i 've always had a good sense of intuition . 
agent low 's theory of suspect zero the undetected serial killer is delusional the product of good intentions paranoia and obsession .  .  . 
zero killed them all ? 
of course not .  they 're possibles .  i 've checked them against bureau records check them against your file .  how did you get it ? 
who told you about her ? 
not the heart the watch . 
what does the file say ? 
so you 're the new meat ? 
i believe it 's in my file sir . 
johnny get this man's file .  mackelway right ? 
thomas mackelway . 
this case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to washington .  your old boss is coming out . 
i do n't .  .  . 
eight nine months ago .  when i was at computer crime .  i got into a chat room with someone named mydick .  i 'd talked to him before .  everything i saw yesterday everything in the autopsies it 's identical .  the forensics are dead on .  mydick 's fantasies involved a hogtie rig nylon cord torture with pliers rip the nipples  when the item screams she chokes .  he had a thing about eyes always the eyes  stab their eyes .  it 's the same guy .  speck was mydick . 
speck is dead . 
350 miles .

you do n't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with ?

she thought you were money . 
i just need some time .  .  . 
 .  .  . whatever .  it 's work .  you 're doing what you love .  what 's she doing ? 
baby she 's the one who should be thinking about you .  sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight .  trust me mikey you 're better off . 
 .  .  . through the kitchen .  .  . 
what 's wrong ?  i saw you talking to that beautiful blonde baby . 
yeah .  i guess you could call it that . 
 .  .  . just be smart about it . 
you owe the don a service .   he has no doubt that you will repay it .

i understand michael .   but you must make a family you know . 
yes but sons who would be professors scientists musicians .  .  . and grandchildren who could be who knows a governor a president even nothing 's impossible here in america . 
there are men in this world who demand to be killed .   they argue in gambling games they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender .  these people wander through the streets calling out kill me kill me .   luca brasi was like that .  and since he was n't scared of death and in fact looked for it .  .  . i made him my weapon .   because i was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him .   i think you have done the same with this man . 
there is nothing there .   not anymore . 
bad news from america .   your brother santino .   he has been killed . 
and hair .   black and curly like a doll .   and such a mouth .

michael . 
my parents do n't read the daily news .   all right if you think i should n't .   i ca n't believe the things the papers are printing .  i 'm sure most of it 's not true .

have you done something to your hair ? 
he 's not a man he 's a god . 
it 's superb . 
he 's not even aware of it .  when you 've got his attention you feel like you 're the only person in the world .  that 's why everybody loves him .  other times .  .  .

mr .  chairman as i understand it the fifth amendment pertains to selfincrimination and i ca n't incriminate myself because i 've done nothing wrong .   besides incrimination is why you have mr .  clyde working for you . 
go on home folks .   and thanks for the welcome . 
be a gentleman .   you have to help me down . 
whoa . 
oh well .  .  .  i guess you .  .  .  in high school you were a pretty good first baseman .   and we were on the debate team together .   but .  .  .  i think you were gonna run the bijou .  you were brought up there and you loved it so much .   and i think you knew how much the town needed a place like that . 
yes .   hic ! 
nothing .   
 .  .  .  and it 's just .  .  .  well deja vu . 
we 've done this before so many times .   the last time was so long ago but it feels like yesterday . 
no they 're not .   i 'd say your investment was paying dividends . 
oh .   okay . 
that 's .  .  .  pretty frightening . 
give the man a hug boy !   that 's your father ! 
well this place sorta reminds me of something . 
the jimmy stewart picture ?   i remember that one .   saw it over at the bijou .   so you remember that huh ? 
i remember the picture .  .  .  but i do n't remember where i saw it . 
and i hear you and harry are planning on reopening the bijou . 
a super market .   huh . 
ca n't wait . 
oh i had irene and old tim but they really could n't help much .  broke their hearts when we closed up .   broke mine too .   but now that you 're back well things will be different around here that 's for sure .   c 'mon i 'll show you where we live . 
oh .   what .  .  .  what time is it ? 
fortytwo was a lean year around here .   the war had just started .  .  .  you were gone less than a month .  .  .  and we were coming off a bit of a drought as i recall .   not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me .   at that time it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures . 
 .  .  .  ernie . 
anybody take it ? 
do n't tell me i know about these things .   i 've seen it before .   it 's all right .   it 's .  .  .  all right .  you 're here .   oh god i love you son .

that 's the one ashes to ashes .  i think it 's great .   but it 'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head .  you ca n't work until you 're cleared  and believe me starting right now i 'm gonna do everything i can to make that happen . 
well that 's a relief .   i understand they usually do n't let that stop them . 
luke did n't smoke . 
leo you were in there you saw what i did .   you think they 're gonna let me write pictures ?   hell they 're probably gonna throw my ass in jail .

cat .   that 's simple .   i like it .   hi cat . 
yeah .  .  .  me too . 
i despise it . 
i suspected as much . 
different ? 
with lydia .   did she seem a trifle distant ? 
lydia liked me you see .  that was the strange part of it .  in fact now that i 'm no longer a threat we 're very good friends . 
someone ought to tell her she 'd be gaining a daughter . 
i can understand his position .  he went through a lot with lydia after his father died .  he did n't want to risk going through it all over again . 
no that 's all right i do n't mind .  i came up here for two reasons .  to begin with i was bored with my job in san francisco .  i was teaching at a private school there .  .  .  well you know you probably went to one yourself . 
i 'll be going too to help out .  it should be fun melanie . 
yes . 
your brother told me . 
could i have a puff ? 
are you coming to my party ? 
i do n't know yet . 
oh .  where d 'you want the coffee ? 
see them two big trees across there ? 
mmmm . 
down at the dock by the tides restaurant .  ever handled an outboard boat ? 
what happened ? 
i do n't think it 's that serious .  you want to sit up here ? 
we 'll make our own fog . 
one apple pie !  you want more coffee ? 
where are the bloody marys deke ? 
yes lovebirds .  we could n't let you .  .  . 
i 'll pick you up miss daniels .  where are you staying ? 
caviat emptor mother .  let the buyer beware . 
yes very . 
how long have you known her ? 
no .  i only led her into believing i believed she was .  .  .  mother it 's really very complicated . 
if there are .  .  .  larger birds mitch .  .  .  they 'll get into the house . 
i do n't know when .   we 'll see what .  .  . 
i know you can .   but i 'd like to . 
i lost my husband four years ago you know .   it 's odd how you depend on someone for strength and then suddenly all the strength is gone and you 're alone .   i 'd love to relax some time .  i 'd love to be able to sleep .   do you think cathy 's all right ? 
now hold it mitch .  you do n't know that for a fact . 
and fridays ?  what do you do then ? 
nothing .   i go to bird shops on fridays . 
i 'm glad you do . 
what 'll it say ? 
and all the while that sparrow was getting in his little messages .  birds of the world unite ! 
take wing ! 
i had n't thought of that .   and then the swifts came . 
have we still got power ? 
santa rosa ? 
yes . 
oh good !  oh wonderful . 
yes certainly .  
no not in the shop .  but i can order them for you . 
 .  .  . insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet .  if it were n't for birds .  .  . 
what do you think they were after miss .  .  .  ? 
no one called it a war ! 
 .  .  . probably contain more than a hundred billion birds ! 
all right all right !   hope you figure this out folks . 
how could i ?   i will do my best .  after all you see i am financially interested . 
i 'm only a student . 
georgina told me how kind you were to her .   it gave me hope you might intercede for us with dr .  macfarlane . 
ma 'am is you 'll allow me i 'd like to give you cause for courage  dr .  macfarlane is a great man  i think he 's the greatest man in medicine .   god would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for georgina 's cure . 
it 's not the failure .  i feel that macfarlane has taught me nothing .  he taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he could n't teach me the poetry of medicine . 
he 's a great doctor  a great man 
if he were only that .  the man's evil himself .  some day you 'll know him as macfarlane knows him  for macfarlane he was to knox as you are to him .  that brought him close to gray he roistered with him and drank with him .  aye and gray even brought him to my door and my love .  there is all that between them and more  burke and hare and knox 
they did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the kings counselor pressed him hard  how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence . 
where can i find him ? 
but i must tell him  he must know of it .  please  tell me where he is . 
and back with macfarlane and all that he stands for the next day . 
well ?  and are you not a good student ? 
why yes . 
maybe there 's another reason .  maybe you have n't friends enough .  could that be it georgina ? 
a doctor ? 
i am a doctor .  i teach medicine . 
here have another glass macfarlane .  i 'll take you home and we 'll be friends again  now that you know that you 're knox 's man and my friend  aye forever . 
get out of here ! 
a pleasure to torment me ? 
i know 
now that is very interesting   take a chair joseph
i come from lisbon . 
eighteen persons they killed and sold the bodies to dr .  knox at ten pounds for a large and eight pounds for a small .  that 's good business joseph . 
see here child when you have this pain in your back where is it ? 
you think it 'll spoil the boy eh ?  was i not assistant to knox ? 
you can get out . 
there 's no scar you freak .  the corvis kid made it up . 
there 's no scar .  corvis made it up . 
could say that . 
christ .  it was corvis .  tommy leonard was right . 
the dead can return given sufficient motivation .  and corvis has that . 
i mean lauren . 
she was eighteen years old !  there were four of them .  they stabbed her fifty three times !  where 's the fucking accident ?  !  huh ?  !  where is it ?  ! 
let 's hope not .  license and registration please . 
just hold on to me . 
honey .  it 's does n't mean anything .  it 's not a message . 
i 'm never going back in that house again .  get away . 
the whole city has stopped .  people are running around like ants ! 
tell me hilda  does all this frighten you  does it make you feel insecure ? 
i assure you such power exists . 
yes  of course . 
that 's enough bobby .  i think it 's time you went to bed . 
now bobby just a minute
well not exactly .  i gave him two dollars . 
yeah  the grass was kind of wet . 
i thought that was only for bombs . 
mr .  carpenter  what does velocity mean ? 
it 's a problem in celestial mechanics . 
their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty . 
i 'm afraid in the present situation you 'll have to learn to think that way . 
i mean the reasons for my coming here . 
i was only hoping to make you understand . 
may i walk out with you ? 
before i ask you to be honest with me perhaps i should be completely honest with you
we 'll be stuck here for a little while  about thirty minutes . 
back to the boardinghouse .  i 'll be safe there for the afternoon  and i can keep an eye on bobby .  he 's the only other person who knows anything about
i was . 
no .  that 's all finished . 
i was only trying to be helpful .  he was having difficulty with a problem . 
how long will that take ? 
fine !   stay here ! 
as a matter of fact we 're almost certain that ghouls and werewolves occupy high positions at city hall . 
el vampiro . 
the meanest ! 
that 's right . 
you 're eating maggots .   how do they taste ? 
where the hell are you from kryton ?  ?  ? 
well .  .  .  he only shows up at the store after dark .   and today his dog attacked my mom .   listen to this .   from uvampiresu ueverywhereu .  .  .   vampires require a daytime protector  a uguardianu  to watch over them as they sleep .  for it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable .  since they hold sway over animals ufierce dogs  the hounds of hellu u are often employed for thisu upurposeu . '

i guess if i had my choice i 'd like to do something that involves children .   work with kids in some way .   teenagers maybe .   and santa carla seems to be full of them . 
you 're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding . 
let me tell you something about boys .   they 're like weeds .   they grow best when they 're ignored . 
let 's go see them .

he 's gone already !   do it ! 
oh shit !   well hang on !

if we 've got any surprises for each other  we should n't be in any condition to do anything about it .   you play chess ? 
it 's getting late .   hurry it .   i 'm going to check the last few rooms . 
could be anything .  .  .  men in isolation .  .  .  some beef that snowballed .  .  .  got out of hand .  .  .

i 'm afraid your indignation is lost here .   i have no more human response to the eloi then you would have to a carrot .   it 's just how we live now . 
so you take their best .  .  . 
and why not ? 
i just love mechanical things . 
no  wait  the moon's falling out of orbit  that 's not possible ! 
hold on .  .  .  i know i have it .  .  . 
no i 'm fine .   i 'm .  .  .    .  .  .  wonderful .   just walking down the street with you again . 
more than 800000 years . 
you can see so many here .

it must have been safe . 
over there was fifth avenue  and the plaza hotel was there .  .  .  this is .  .  .  the carriage path .   we 're on the carriage path . 
yes .  .  .  a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship shape . 
i could .  .  . 
my laboratory was about .  .  .  here .  and the kitchen was over there where that tree is .   mrs .  watchit would n't allow me in much .  .  .  but yes this is about the kitchen . 
what 's the matter with   ?    what would i do without you mrs .  watchit ? 
my equations are not parlortricks ! 
abstract mathematics relativity of dimensions geometrical durations  even allowing for the uses of speculation what is the point ? 
well we 're happy you 're here .  come inside . 
we have to go after them find where   ! 
then it 's time to change that 
dean fulton .  .  . 
yes sir . 
and what does that mean ? 
i think you know .  your eyes say you do . 
dog tags .  off her blank look they 've got your name and date of birth for identification . 
i do n't know .  beat i thought i was crazy after you left that day .  i died .  i still think i could be crazy .  but then i replayed that night in my head  the parts of it i could remember  and it was like .  .  . i do n't care if i was or am .  i have n't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life .  beat and when you left all i wanted was .  .  . 
you think lorenson kills you ? 
then why is n't there anyone around ? 
to the hospital . 
nowhere .  beat i just think i 'm gonna be sick . 
good .  how 's your mom ? 
you 're bleeding pretty bad there . 
i 'm doing fine . 
you 're not crazy . 
so it 's helping ? 
beat i do n't know . 
no i do .  that 's what i 'm saying to you . 
listen to me !  you do n't !  the jacket is my only chance in this place . 
it does n't look all that different . 
what about the world ? 
because i do n't have time . 
i 'm about to die unless i do something to stop it . 
what are you talking about ? 
mortality 's actually a great thing to be familiar with .  it means you 're sane on some level . 
sure . 
have you always been a waitress ? 
beat why ? 
funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a friday night .   you 'd almost think they 's want to forget about it for the weekend . 
no you wo n't .   you 'll be back today .  now !   you get your ass back here thelma now goddamnit .   thelma do you understand me ? 
yes baby ? 
do you think you could ever shoot someone ? 
you know what ?   you 're starting to irritate me . 
well you 're not exactly an expert witness but what makes you so sure ? 
if waitin' tables in a bar do n't make you an expert on human nature then nothin' will and i could 've told you that harlan puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot .  i 'm just surprised it did n't happen before now . 
well if i had to guess i 'd say it was some ol' gal some ol' gal 's husband .   but it was n't either one of those two .   the tall one the redhead she left me a huge tip . 
good .   you wanna tell me what happened ? 
sure .   maybe over coffee sometime .  i 'll buy . 
tell us about him . 
we do n't have a whole lotta choice do we ?   i ca n't figure out if they 're real smart or just really really lucky . 
i do n't know .   nothin' .   took a shower . 
that sounds nice . 
well not anymore thelma except for bustin' parole i have n't done one wrong thing . 
what did ya do ? 
well i was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' i was good at so i .  .  . 
i may be the outlaw but you 're the one stealin' my heart . 
good answer .   same goes double for me . 
something real bad has happened and i ca n't tell you what just that it 's bad and i did it and i ca n't undo it .   can you help me ? 
no for that much money i have to tell them exactly which office .   i know i 've had to have money wired to me on the road .   and there has to be a code word or they wo n't give it to you .   i 'll have to tell you the code . 
good .   that was good .   where do i go ? 
it 's a place called shaw 's siesta motel .   the address is 1921 north east 23 .   it 's under your name . 
and what 's the mysterious code word ? 
okay okay just tell me what 's the trouble . 
it 's nothin' like that . 
jimmy .  .  .  it 's beautiful ! 
'cause louise .   i do n't want to lose you .   and for some reason i get the feelin' you 're about to split .  permanently . 
i do n't know .   it does n't even matter anymore .   i just want you to be happy .  .  .  it 's not that i do n't love you either .   but jimmy your timing could n't be worse . 
you wanna let me see your license please ? 
hmmm .   we gotta get some money . 
actin' like what ?  !   how am i supposed to act ?   scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody 's head off ! 
i suggested we go to the police but you did n't like that so frankly louise i 'm all out of ideas . 
i .  .  .  i do n't know .   i do n't know what you 're askin' me . 
it 's probably not a good idea . 
louise and darryl do n't get along . 
nothing .   why ?   do i seem different ? 
well i 'm not on drugs .   but i might be crazy . 
do n't worry about it .   you want anything ? 
what happened ? 
now you get a grip louise !   just drive us to goddamn mexico will ya ! 
what for ? 
to find out if he knows anything .  if you think he does you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped . 
jeez louise tapped the phone ?   you think so ? 
they do n't know that !   it was just you and me there .   i 'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him !   i mean it 's almost the truth ! 
just past boise city . 
oklahoma thelma .   we 're crossing into new mexico . 
i guess i always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs . 
oh yeah .   you mean peekapoos . 
always lookin' on the bright side are n't ya ? 
well you got it now . 
harlan . 
what ?  !   what about him ?  ! 
 .  .  .  in texas .  .  .  did n't it ?   that 's what happened .  .  .  oh my god . 
sorry ! 
it 's good .   it 's what the pioneers ate . 
are you alright ? 
what 'd i say again ? 
that guy was hurtin' me .   and if you had n't come out when you did he 'd a hurt me a lot worse .   and probably nothin' woulda happened to him .  cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night .   and they woulda made out like i asked for it .   and my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now .   at least now i 'm havin' fun .   and i 'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead .  i 'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me .   and if i have n't i wanna take this time to thank you louise .   thank you for savin' my ass . 
but i do n't know .  .  .  something 's crossed over in me and i ca n't go back .   i mean i just could n't live .  .  . 
yes !   yes !   now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that ? 
does that mean suck my dick ? 
yeah right .   we 're not gonna get caught . 
why ? 
i guess i went a little crazy huh ? 
goodlooking ? 
well why do n't you look her up ? 
yeah right . 
he 'll do better than that .  i 'll send him down to miami on business you throw him a couple bucks on the side and he 'll track her down . 
never met him . 
what ? 
flew .   told my wife i was going to a promise keepers convention . 
got cash . 
pipes ?  what are you talking about ? 
yeah that 's more or less what the others said too .  out getting coffee .  .  .  supposed to meet him here .  .  .  picking up my grandma .  .  . 
fuckin' animals .  hey what do you say we go grab a couple drinks . 
what are you talking about ?  you were never an alky you were a cokehead . 
yeah well when you quit blow you gotta quit the booze too . 
this is a light beer .  you ca n't have a light beer ? 
no i ca n't .

ah fuck ya then you big pussy .  what are you spotting ? 
who the fuck is it to you ? 
no thanks . 
how 'd you know that ? 
it 's right there on your golf bag . 
well just until i get my pga tour card . 
i work with retards . 
i beg your pardon ? 
well it 's more of an enclosure really . 
wow i 've never seen him like this .  he does n't usually like guys . 
great . 
that .  .  .  ?  vestibule . 
sadly no .  well except for the lint . 
why bounce when you have your own condo in nepal to go to ? 
have you seen it ? 
what do you mean why' ? 
boston huh ?  did you get your degree up there ? 
you mean him . 
nice smokescreen is n't it ? 
maybe this 'll jog your memory . 
bullshit ! 
sully .  .  .  !  what the fuck happened here ?  ! 
that must make it tough . 
sucks .  so what 's up ?  you some kind of salesman or something ? 
think about it .  you walk into a video store and you see eightminute abs and right next to it you see seven minute abs  which one you gonna spring for ? 
jeez i do n't know where you 're ever going to find a guy like that . 
no i 'm not . 
is that old crab still with you ?  mary you said you were putting her up for a month  it 's been a year and a half . 
meaning these are the people you live amongst you got a right to know if they 're creeps .  for instance did you know there 's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife ? 
this one 's almost thirty years old .  it 's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love . 
do n't get ahead of yourself .  you 'll probably need it before i will . 
so maybe i could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies . 
knock it off pollyanna just cause you 're in love does n't mean everyone else has to be . 
i appreciate you looking out for me . 
thanks but i 've got to be going .  unfortunately doc this is n't a social visit . 
tucker i appreciate you doing all this but i 'm really strapped for time here and 
you mean he 's not a criminal ? 
hi mary . 
are you all right ? 
he 's dead . 
no it was a good thing .   i mean good in that it was very quick . 
nope nope  dodged a few bullets .   god i cannot believe i 'm standing here with mary jenson . 
oh great i ran out . 
oh .   oh that 's a good one . 
would you shhh !  mary 's gonna hear us . 
i mean is it .  .  .  is it .  .  .  ? 
eh . 
uhhuh . 
we 're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier .  if it turns ugly the russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine . 
what are you doing ? 
tomorrow .  .  . 
complete snowjob .  and then we went out and told the country they were n't putting missiles into cuba .   by the way you realize we just lost the midterms . 
what about the allies ?  congress ?  i think we may need to start letting key people know .  and they 're all scattered across the country for the campaign .  we 're going to need to get the u . n .  staff in and warmed up .  jesus .  .  .  i do n't even know if we 've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the soviets got that cryptographer of ours . 
yeah but the country did n't even exist as a country yet .  it was a mess and he did n't have a leg to stand on . 
they 're going to be pressing for a military solution soon .  we ca n't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats .  we need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here . 
something your father would 've come up with . 
helen and i went out for breakfast .  excom 's not supposed to convene til eight . 
we just got a second letter from khruschev .  the deal 's off . 
so now you 've got to talk him out of it .  and then we 've got to figure out an acceptable political solution . 
then they should speak up . 
says what kenny ? 
general the joint chiefs have just signaled our intent to escalate to the soviets .  you have signaled an escalation which i had no wish to signal and which i did not approve . 
i do n't know .  i do n't know . 
i know i know .  .  . 
then somebody 'd better deny it publicly . 
i 've got to move .  what do you have kenny ? 
do n't take it to court but we 've got good circumstantial evidence .  .  .   walter agrees .  my gut 's telling me khruschev 's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message . 
that may be what they want us to think . 
breathe carl .  four nice deep ones . 
do n't have one carl .  i have a number man .  just like the numbers on those treasury checks .  you stole from your own country carl .  shame on you . 
yes .  rooms thirteen and fourteen are on indian land . 
i see . 
sioux indian right ? 
i think leo 's retired from quillwork for the moment . 
ray levoi sir .  pleasure . 
good . 
i got one up on ya . 
good question .  hardly sees anybody anymore .  has n't left this place in twenty years .  did you bring some tobacco ? 
he wants to know if you ever watch the cookie monster .  he says the cookie monster is not to be trusted  a trickster . 
he also said listen to the water . 
listen to the water .  listen to the owl .  he also said do n't trust the fucking cookie monster . 
i do n't see the connection . 
go catch jimmy ray .  really .  he 's gettin' away .  go ahead go get him .  i 'm late . 
it 's not real . 
cut the shit .  you should n't be in here man . 
what are you talking about ? 
you got jimmy .  let her go . 
oh yeah .  dreams .  sometimes durin' sickness .  vision quest .  sweat lodge .  ya never know when . 
listen to the water .  .  .  the river keeps goin' down then rising again . 
ray . 
i know .  come on .  we gotta get off the reservation or we 're dead . 
jimmy did n't kill leo .  why do you wanna do this ? 
try the fort laramie treaty .  all over again . 
i 'm from minneapolis .  fifth street .  i did four years at dartmouth before i ever set foot on this res .  so i know about the other world ray . 
 you desecrated it it had to be burned . 
you forced an innocent man to run like an animal .  you 've tried to poison my people 's hearts against me with your manipulation with letters i never wrote .  .  .  you 've been watching me eat work raise my family .  .  .  wash myself in the river .  and now you 're here arresting me at a sacred place .   in your eyes that 's power . 
washee is like .  .  .  a dumpling .  like tallow we put in stew .  i think he was calling you chubby boy . 
great . 
mister tully . 
what the fuck you talkin' about ? 
get up out of the chair and walk toward the backdoor richard . 
leo fast elk .  .  .  is alive . 
and on to a bigger one with you ? 
was there ever a girl who did n't like fighter pilots ? 
that 's all ! 
and i asked someone .  charlie you think you 're pretty smart . 
no i beg yours .  but i do n't think you 're right on that . 
not in this case .  charlie  you saw a mig push negative 4g ? 
where were you ? 
i 'm fine . 
not to me .

it was alright for a while you know .   but then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing couple years ago . 
we 're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security .   now you know exactly as much as i do .   so just get your gear off and get up to control .   there 's some kind of briefing in ten minutes . 
forget it sonny .   they 're gone . 
kirkhill ?   that guy does n't know his butt from a rathole .   hey perry ! 
your rig ? 
not even when it meant something .   is that one night up in flatbed ? 
i was worried about the rig .   i 've got over four years invested in this project . 
oh yeah right .  .  .  and you only had three years with me . 
i 'll tell you what happened .  .  .  you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh . 
god you are the most stubborn woman i ever knew . 
okay .  .  .  hippy 's not going .  .  .  mcwhirter you can run little geek . 
hey you come on my rig you do n't talk to me you start ordering my guys around .   it wo n't work .   you gotta know how to handle these people .  .  .  we have a certain way of doing things here . 
it 's his mixture !   too much oxygen ! 
missed what ? 
just checking is out huh ?   how come ? 
it 's twitching but it 's below the line you said was safe . 
bud it 's the pressure .   try to concentrate .  concentrate on my voice .   just listen to my voice . 
he 's hallucinating badly . 
a little more so this time . 
so it will just take you a little longer to get over it . 
but i think we should talk about it .  or are you fully convinced that we too wo n't understand each other ? 
but why rattle your brains by arguing and talking .  .  .  believe me anna words never help at all .  they only serve to confuse .  i love you anna .  is n't i that enough ? 
and have you any other truths to tell me ? 
you already know what they are . 
i understand very well .  only i do n't want any rash assumptions to be made . 
sir if you have no objections may we start the search ? 
yes you should go . 
but then when will we see each other ? 
but sooner or later we 've got to end this relationship .  and it 's better to do it right now . 
no sandro please .  .  .  i ask you as a favor .  .  . 
then why do you say them ? 
so even if i did say them i was sincere with her as i am now with you . 
i 'm sure you 'd be able to design some very lovely things . 
so .  .  .  oh how i wish that everything were so much simpler .  .  .  that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes .  what size shoe do you wear ?  size 9 .  that 's a very lovely size .  but i 'm sorry i wear size 8 . 
i was only joking really .  .  .  ca n't i make a joke ?  and now you 've got to tell me why you do n't want to . 
better dead . 
it means being without money . 
but what 's gotten into you ?  .  .  .  we would have known .  sandro must be out in the garden somewhere taking a breath of fresh air or watching the break of dawn .  it would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type . 
but why all nudes ? 
i think all you have to do giulia is to close the door . 
and you expect to find him in here ?  go and ask claudia . 
ask her . 
you men are all so dreadful ! 
answer me why do n't you try posing ?  i 'll paint you a beautiful portrait . 
i appeal to you more ? 
so ?  that 's logical .  you see both being gardeners they spoke about you to one another . 
they told me that you were a very nice girl that you always mind your business .  .  .  in other words things of that sort . 
 .  .  .  you need n't worry about being attractive here . 
christ said it in the bible he said  suffer the little children i want to suffer like a little child . 
but she watches .  .  .  she listens . 
you 've got to eat something agnes . 
should you see a doctor ? 
have you ever loved anyone ? 
yes . 
oh yes ! 
yes . 
oh yes . 
where do you meet ? 
i never saw any baby .  .  .  i think they made it up . 
agnes .  .  . 
anything ? 
anything . 
martha louise livingston . 
no . 
do you have any children ? 
no questions . 
no wonder .  .  .  wait .  .  .  agnes .  .  .  agnes how do you feel about babies ? 
where did you go ? 
i get headaches .  mommy did too .  .  .  oh but she was n't stupid .  she knew things that nobody else knew . 
why not ?   mmm ? 
i could never be a mother . 
a mistake .  .  . 
if you 're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and did n't want me but that 's not true she was a good woman a saint .  .  .  
what the child ? 
everything .  .  .  i do n't have children . 
but you 're troubled .  .  .  are n't you ? 
only you think you 're lucky because you did n't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe were n't always nice but that was because of me because i was bad not her . 
what did you do ? 
you can tell me . 
how ? 
she watches .  .  .  she listens . 
she .  .  . 
why ? 
how does she know that ? 
i 'm afraid . 
as much as mother miriam does ? 
who am i ? 
to help me . 
of what ? 
but it 's easy .  it 's just a breath with sound .  say it .  what kind of trouble ? 
i had a baby . 
because i was afraid . 
no not yet agnes very soon but not yet .  how did the baby get into you ? 
would you like to tell me ? 
will she be angry ? 
sister marguerite i think . 
i feel as if i 've eaten glass . 
what do you do ? 
of me .  oh .  .  .  god !   my god .  .  .   water .  .  .  it 's all water .  .  . 
go away i do n't want you here . 
is someone in the room with you ? 
do you remember what just happened ? 
yes . 
what did she mean ? 
yes . 
where ? 
yes . 
agnes who did this to you ? 
yes . 
martha all we 're saying is noone wants this to come to trial not the church not the crown .  .  .  least of all me . 
you 're too involved marty .   jesus look at you .  why do n't you turn this case over to someone else ? 
yes that 's because i 'm getting to her . 
it 's gone on long enough .  you 're out . 
you have proof ? 
who are you ? 
mama that was n't marie that was me ! 
oh we own the land around here .  but we rent it out .  we keep a few acres for ourselves  some wheat corn some vegetables . 
who told you this ? 
i can beat that . 
noone . 
how did she hide it from the other nuns ? 
how did she hide it during the day ? 
do n't ask me those questions dear i 'm not the patient . 
look doctor i do n't know how to tell you this politely but i do n't approve of you .  not you personally .  .  . 
exactly .  i want you do deal with agnes as speedily and as easily as possible .  she wo n't hold up under any sort of cross examination . 
and i am not from the middle ages .  i know what you are !   i do n't want that mind cut open . 
how could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth ? 
if she 's so innocent how come she murdered a child ? 
and in your eyes ? 
you do n't really believe something like that happened do you ? 
shortly after she came to us . 
and you were n't shocked ? 
not simple no . 
and i intend to take her away from him .  that 's what you 're afraid of is n't it ? 
nuns .  .  .  you hate nuns . 
how dare you think i 'm in a position to be pressured .  .  . 
 .  .  .  or bullied or what ever you 're doing .  who the hell do you think you are ?   you go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child . 
and she has a right to know that there 's a world out there filled with people who do n't believe in god .  .  .    .  .  .  and are n't any worse off than you mother .  people who 've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once to anybody .  and people who fall in love and have babies and occas sionally are very happy .  she has a right to know that .  but you and your .  .  .  your order and your church have kept her ignorant .  .  . 
i am not a virgin doctor .  i was married for twenty three years two daughters .  i even have grandchildren .  .  .  surprised ?  it might please you to know that i was a failure as a wife and mother .  my children wo n't even see me any more that 's their revenge .  i think they tell their friends that i 've passed on .  and do n't tell me i 'm making up for past mistakes doctor freud .  
earthquakes ? 
what sheets ? 
the twenty third of january .  on that night one of our elder nuns passed away . 
there is more here than meets the eye is n't there ?   lots of dirty little secrets . 
the cards .  .  .  you 're bank . 
eight and two thirds . 
are you now ? 
no ginger eddy fallon and ding dong . 
yeah that 's right they was supposed to come with us but they chickened . 
not much cop without em is it ? 
how about ding dong ? 
read em ! 
spoil sport ! 
well ! 
no i know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins . 
of course i can . 
make a note of that word and give it to susan .  i think it 's rather touching really .  here 's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when i know for a fact within four weeks he 'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he is n't wearing one of these nasty things .  of course they 're grotty you wretched nit that 's why they were designed but that 's what you 'll want . 
i do n't care . 
she 's a drag .  a wellknown drag .  we turn the sound down on her and say rude things . 
oh that 's me other grandfather but this one 's me grandfather and all .

follow your impulse . 
well what happened ? 
well it must be catching .  he 's given it to the champ here .

oh i see .  you are an actress though are n't you ? 
well you 've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee . 
have you no natural resources of your own ?  have they even robbed you of that ? 
you can learn from books . 
any old where  .  .  .  but not our little richard  .  .  .  oh no !  when you 're not thumping them pagan skins you 're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish ! 
do you think i have n't noticed  .  .  .  do you think i was n't aware of the drift ?  oh  .  .  .  you poor unfortunate scuff they 've driven you into books by their cruel unnatural treatment exploiting your good nature . 
a book ! 
i 'm going parading before it 's too late ! 
keep your voice down this lot 'll paste you just for the exercise .  oh they 're a desperate crew of drippings and they 've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you . 
lip reading . 
who are these ruffians ?  .  .  .  i 've never seen them before in my life !   .  .  .  
nothing he 's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts  .  .  .  oh he 's a swine but a clever swine mind .

i did n't say it was bad for you it 's just kind of sickening that 's all . 
that way . 
all over the ship we 'll have to check the charts to know for sure . 
it 's still in the ship ? 
right . 
well .  .  .  i 'm going to have to blow the engines out .  .  . 
no we ca n't afford to lose that much oxygen .   we 're going to have to flush it out . 
right .  
and be right back . 
well ca n't we kill it ?   i mean we ca n't leave the damn thing on him . 
how about cutting it off ?   we ca n't pull it loose but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer where it 's stuck to his face . 
it 's eating a hole in the floor ! 
but this thing uses it for ubloodu . 
we 'd be sitting ducks in the freezers . 
careful do n't get under it ! 
maybe it was n't always dead . 
how 's broussard ? 
he 's running a fever . 
no . 
how far ? 
we should be almost on top of it .   i just ca n't quite .  .  . 
maybe we should just wait a few more minutes . 
help me  i 'm going to try to get it off . 
how the hell should i know ?   come on give me a hand let 's get him out of there ! 
right .   fire up all systems . 
computer you have signalled a priority three message .   what is the message ? 
it appears to be some sort of spacecraft .   we 're going to approach it . 
i agree .   this is the single most important discovery in history . 
but why draw it on the wall ? 
we ca n't leave him out here open the door . 
i ca n't lean on faust any harder  he 's been working nonstop on the engines . 
up one kilometer jay .

i told you we .  .  .  what 's that ? 
wait a minute .

i 'm not enough for a paragraph . 
that 's right . 
frankly  yes . 
what else ? 
you have no right to say such things ! 
we decided the night before last before we came up here .  .  . 
we sat and talked addison .  i want a run of the play contract . 
look closely eve it 's time you did .  i am addison dewitt .  i 'm nobody 's fool .  least of all  yours . 
i never intended you to be . 
yes you did .  you still do . 
addison will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly  and then get out so i can take my nap ! 
more plainly and more distinctly ?  i have not come to new haven to see the play discuss your dreams or to pull the ivy from the walls of yale !  i have come to tell you that you will not marry lloyd  or anyone else  because i will not permit it . 
everything .  because after tonight you will belong to me . 
 .  .  .  taken it for granted ?  that you and i .  .  . 
it is true that your parents were poor .  they still are .  and they would like to know how you are  and where .  they have n't heard from you for three years .  .  . 
she did like you she helped and trusted you !  you paid her back by trying to take bill away ! 
i had lunch with karen not three hours ago .  as always with women who want to find out things she told more than she learned .  .  .    .  .  .  do you want to change your story about lloyd beating at your door the other night ? 
could n't go on ?  you 'll give the performance of your life .

the caterer had to back for hors d 'oeuvres  voila . 
that french ventriloquist taught you a lot did n't he ?

well i certainly think it 's odd he has n't even come up .  .  . 
what for ? 
you probably wo n't believe me . 
i might . 
you see the play ?  you 've seen the play every performance ?   but do n't you find it  i mean apart from everything else  do n't you find it expensive ? 
she 's got to meet you
my husband .  .  . 
do n't bother i can take it up myself .  .  . 
there ca n't be very much
something most important you can do . 
you talk just as addison said you did . 
thank you karen . 
let 's get back to this one .  have you really seen every performance ?   why ?  i 'm curious .  .  . 
farmers were poor in those days that 's what dad was  a farmer .  i had to help out .  so i quit school and i went to milwaukee .  i became a secretary .  in a brewery .   when you 're a secretary in a brewery  it 's pretty hard to make believe you 're anything else .  everything is beer .  it was n't much fun but it helped at home   and there was a little theater group .  .  .  like a drop of rain in the desert .  that 's where i met eddie .  he was a radio technician .  we played liliom' for three performances i was awful  then the war came and we got married .  eddie was in the air force  and they sent him to the south pacific .  you were with the o . w . i .  were n't you mr .  richards ?   that 's what who 's who' says .  .  .  well with eddie gone my life went back to beer .  except for a letter a week .  one week eddie wrote he had a leave coming up .  i 'd saved my money and vacation time .  i went to san francisco to meet him .   eddie was n't there .  they forwarded the telegram from milwaukee  the one that came from washington to say that eddie was n't coming at all .  that eddie was dead .  .  .    .  .  .  so i figured i 'd stay in san francisco .  i was alone but could n't go back without eddie .  i found a job .  and his insurance helped .  .  .  and there were theaters in san francisco .  and one night margo channing came to play in remembrance' .  .  .  and i went to see it .  and  well  here i am .  .  . 
i was dreadful miss channing believe me  i have no right to be anyone 's understudy much less yours .  .  . 
san francisco .  it was the last week .  i went one night .  .  .  the most important night in my life  until this one .  anyway .  .  .  i found myself going the next night  and the next and the next .  every performance .  then when the show went east  i went east . 
i wo n't be a minute . 
easy now .  .  . 
up to here !  that 's where i 've got it  up to here !  of all the star ridden presumptuous hysterical
 do n't run out of adjectives dear . 
we 're driving out to the country tomorrow night .  just the four of us .  bill margo you and i .  .  . 
when you asked a minute ago it was fivefortytwo .  it is now five fortythree .  when you ask a minute from no it will be
fivefiftyfive .  we 'll be at the station in plenty of time .  .  . 
just a little skid that 's all .  this road 's like glass . 
for once to write something and have it realized completely .  for once not to compromise
margo ! 
i have no possible interest in anything she 'd have to say . 
did miss harrington tell you to call mr .  richards ? 
that was way back .  .  . 
up in the room . 
the play ?  all right i guess .  .  . 
i know what i 'm talking about after all they 're my plays .  .  . 
you 'd have been proud of her . 
i never said it was ! 
the situation i 'm in ai n't the kind you can belch your way out .  i made a promise .  .  . 
miss caswell ?   what ? 
promise . 
that 's my max . 
mainly it has to do with your choice of words . 
the fucking new york times . 
christ and i even know somebody at the phone company
you do ? with access to records ? 
mitchell stans magruder kalmbach
he said john haldeman not bob haldeman
and the fbi confirmswhat more do you need ? 
howard hunt ? 
he is not in the car .   sorry . 
when did he hire you ? 
sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe  off the record . 
when you guys print it in the paper then i 'll know .   i 'm a lawyer and i 'll probably go to jail and be disbarred and what did i do that was so awful ? 
sureoff the record . 
i think it might be helpful if you 'd send me to toronto .  that was your spiel then .  the lifestyles of deserters .   i 'm still waiting for it . 
nobody 's perfect .   i 'm glad you 're out of it hannah you 're a terrific reporter and i turned you into a bookkeeper . 
it was all in hundreds was n't it ? 
'cause i 'm not calling out from the phone company anymore  i think the place is bugged . 
what do you want to know ? 
a miami d . a .  the guy doing the investigating is named martin dardis .  
we 're moving .   i 've been looking for a job but it 's been .  .  .  hard .  my name 's been in the papers too much .  sometimes i wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence .  i 'm not thinking of myself .  but my wife my parents it 's been very rough on them . 
it 's gotta be haldemansomeone from the white house had to be involved
it 's not that we 're using unnamed sources that bothers me or that everything we print the white house denies or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff . 
the fbi thinks it 's possiblethe democrats need a campaign issue corruption's always a good one .   get off the story benor put some people on mcgovern's finances fair is fair even in our business . 
his dialing finger must be falling off
mitchell started the coverup early everyone is involved in the cover up all the way to the top .  the whole u . s .  intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities .  the extent of it is incredible .   and people 's lives are in danger maybe including ours . 
preliminary hearing at superior courthouse ? 
i did all right on mccord . 
mr .  john mitchell the head of creep says it means nothing .    .  .  . this man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent .  these is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity and we will not forget it or condone it .

just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne .  like some ? 
so they 'll shoot me  like a horse . 
i think you should .  i have to run down to the grocery anyway  all that 's left around here is one frozen pizza   i 'll be right back  okay ?

some people said that .   i never thought so . 
of course .   i was going to be james bond . 
are they usually like that ? 
did it ever bother james bond ? 
that 's fiction . 
nothing . 
what happens if you do ? 
why do n't you bring it out here ?  it 's beautiful out here . 
he wo n't be looking for you .   just be careful .   buy a book .   keep your sunglasses on . 
book .   sunglasses .   great . 
taiwan .

he will be hidden somewhere out here probably somewhere low in the crowd .   he 'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank . 
five million apiece .   you get on your plane i get on mine . 
what ? 
i do n't know .   it just happened .   i was here ten years ago i 'm here now .   that 's it . 
you did n't take it . 
ten years later here you are again . 
how do you know they 're not ? 
what ? 
and you were drilling these holes .  .  .  ? 
he told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of selfpreservation . 
anytime . 
funny i 've never been a talker .  my wife was always getting on me about that .   say what you feel tell me what 's bothering you you ve got to talk to me .  i never would though .   not really . 
why not ? 
i do n't know .   part of me wanted to but part of me always said what 's she going to be able to do ?  i do n't know .   maybe i did n't trust her . 
you 're pretty famous are n't you ? 
'taken .  that 's nice .   when i had someone taken i would call our general contractor transfer the money and as soon as i hung up the phone i forgot about them . 
i thought that i would be thinking about margaret or work or that i 'd be having these deep profound and depressing thoughts but i 'm not .   i 'm trying to think really profound thoughts but i ca n't .  it seems very funny to me . 
you mean quit ? 
of course senor . 
and pay for their drinks occasionally . 
yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints ! 
still fifty cents ai n't bad . 
no it 's the whole idea behind it .  how did they get this place ? 
puppet theatre do n't you need something a little bigger ? 
damn right it is it 's a chance to do something meaningful for a change to leave our mark on this town .  hell you 'll probably be gone in another six months and all you 'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a led zep' song  c 'mon do n't run out on me now ! 
scout around and see if there 's something check that other corridor .  if there 's nothing nip out and buy a broom and shovel . 
yeah you 're in luck there 's two of them the other 's in there . 
later mate right now i 've got to do the locks on these doors so we do n't have to climb through that bloody window every time . 
and if the police stop by  what do i tell them ? 
sounds like a good reason to leave it alone . 
i 'll rig up something do n't worry  do you think i could bash through with that little hammer ? 
is it gone fourthirty ? 
i had a better idea we 'll burn them .  there 's a drum across the road i was just waiting for the workers to go home . 
no i figure once they see the place and we get 'em a little drunk they 'll all want to help .  we should have that floor done in a day or so . 
no it could take me hours .  you know what it 's like trying to find things in this town not to mention disposable stuff  i would n't think they 've ever heard of them . 
what ? 
no the boyfriend . 
holly ! 
a fine specimen for conversion . 
shhhhh i 'm concentrating ! 
i think he 's jealous of havel . 
well not any more now i 'm a serious writer and above this crap .

i was twelve . 
mars does n't rise until 230

the doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible .   i did n't want anyone being  weird around me . 
i made you do too many things kept you up all night 
tired . 
let 's get something straight .  you do n't know me .  i do n't know you .  but i know what you 're about .   keep your distance from this house  and from jamie . 
how  how long does she have ? 
i 'm using an old phonographic turntable .

then where the hell is he ? 
sure he agreed quickly . 
you did n't professor .  it was an accident !  you see what happened 
we do n't .  .  .  . 
apparently what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother 's emotional behavior . 
are you trying to tell me that my mother 's got the hots for me ? 
jesus ! 
okay . 
you expect me to believe that ? 
okay . 
thirty aught six . 
they 're okay . 
well i 've got to read them first .  suppose i could get a coke while i do ? 
i was n't aware there was any law against it . 
i 've got a gun here sir .  it 's always a good idea to have one around . 
well i mean there 's nothing he wants to know about it .  .  .  i 've got to run . 
yeah but i do n't like it . 
okay . 
no . 
i do n't care . 
you said that once already .  .  .  too late now . 
yeah you look tired .  .  .  listen honey .  when all this is over i 'm going to sit down and buy you a big thick steak . 
anybody ever done that to you before ? 
i 'm serious . 
nothing .  .  .  i was just running off at the mouth .  .  .  as usual . 
he 's not coming to take us for a ride either .  come on let 's make a run for the car . 
i 'm a giant semiconductor and there 's alien creatures all around us .  form the eighth dimension i think .   look .  .  . 
and try the president 's private number at the hospital .   make sure this is on the level .  we 're busy people here . 
she wants a picture . 
i 'm sure we 'll find out soon enough . 
orson wells ?   what about doctor lizardo ? 
somebody get her a mike ?  can we manage that ?   and a spotlight .   what 's your name ? 
she was murdered by hanoi shan on our wedding night . 
hanoi shan ?   the guy in your comic books .   boss of the world crime league ?   supreme commander of the legion of death ?   the pivot of mystery himself ?   you 're putting me on .   he 's a cartoon character . 
you 're gonna have to repeat that i think buckaroo . 
i have a radio fix .  .  . 
you look !   it 's not here ! 
where 's buckaroo ?   is he alive ? 
course he 's alive .   he 's buckaroo banzai . 
why me ? 
no !   ditto the professor
what !  ?   ted okum does n't know shit .  they 've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year .  what ted okum does n't know you could almost squeeze into the hollywood bowl . 
wallace beery .  wrestling picture .  what do you need a road map ? 
you do n't understand .  he 's in pain because he ca n't write
i 'm not sure anymore .  i guess i try to make a difference . 
to see pap . 
i do n't know garland my place is here right now .  i feel i 'm on the brink of success
i 'm fine garland but i have to talk with you . 
very important garland .  i just thought you should know that .  whatever happens . 
yes .  .  .  is n't it ? 
what kind of work do you do barton if you do n't mind my asking ? 
you do n't say .  that 's a tough racket .  my hat 's off to anyone who can make a go of it .  damned interesting work i 'd imagine . 
damned difficult i 'd imagine . 
well ai n't that a kick in the head ! 
yeah i guess it is .  but in a way that 's exactly the point .  there 's a few people in new york  hopefully our numbers are growing  who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience create a theater for the masses that 's based on a few simple truths  not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that does n't hold true today if they ever did .  .  . 
i can see you feel pretty strongly about it . 
yeah the ladies do ask for attention .  in my experience they pretend to give it but it 's generally a smoke screen for demanding it back  with interest .  how about family bart ?  how 're you fixed in that department ? 
well that 's all that wrestling is .  except usually there 's more grunting and squirming before the pin .  well it 's your first time .  and you 're out of your weight class . 
hi charlie . 
yeah as a matter of fact they did .  come on in . 
know about it ?  i can practically see how they 're doin' it .  brother i wish i had a piece of that . 
i 'm truly sorry to hear that charlie .  i 'll miss you . 
well hell buddy do n't pull a long face !   this is still home for me  i keep my room and i 'll be back sooner or later .  .  . 
charlie i 'm in trouble  something horrible 's happened  i 've gotta call the police .  .  .

i did n't know you knew who picasso was gus . 
what is it you got between you ? 
i went over last night too . 
say what ? 
i feel fine ! 
we bring her in for questioning . 
she knew she could beat it .   that 's why she asked to take it . 
how the fuck do you know ?   what is it with you and this broad anyway ? 
on what basis ? 
i 'm a painter too . 
i do n't know . 
no .  it 's one of the few times i feel good .  i used to have to go to work and cook every day .  that i got sick of .

ignorant art ? 
ohhh .  that 's new .  that sounds good . 
yeah  i 'd do that .  .  .  you could teach me . 
sure . 
just look at him .   little silver thingies on his cowboy boots ?  honey i do n't think so . 
yes i understand  but where do you take them from ? 
you mean like an ape ? 
samo .

tony bennett .  .  .  what do you mean ? 
so shut up and keep painting .  . 
i did n't know .

affair  .  .  .  yes maybe  .  .  .  if she  .  .  . 
i think i 'll take the stairs . 
ah .   who may i ask are you going as ? 
yes i suppose that we did . 
right .   sure .   and peace on earth good will toward men . 
i tried to grab you  save you 
touring the riot scene .   gravely assessing the devastation .  upstanding mayor stuff . 
things change . 
did n't i say that ? 
i ah  .  .  .  did n't catch your last name . 
well i 'm .  .  .  braver at night if that 's what you mean .  .  . 
 .  .  .  and me .   no that 's be me and me .   is that what i said ? 
and the truth frightened her ? 
i do n't know .   till we figure it out let 's  .  .  .  let 's keep dancing . 
no .   no glass on the inside . 
weird huh ? 
 .  .  .  eight seven .  .  . 
i could teach her my french flipper trick .  .  . 
oswald  we need one more thing . 
a platform ?   lemme see  .  .  .  stop global warming .   start global cooling .   make the world a colder place .   ufrigidu  .  .  . 
i do n't .   so no . 
and a very very good one . 
uh selina this is uh bruce wayne . 
perhaps the truth is you do n't really trust anyone . 
do n't be silly alfred .  after all she 's family . 
why yes actually .   death and chance stole your parents .   but rather than become a victim you have done everything in your power to control the fates .   for what is batman if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world an attempt to control death itself . 
pheromones ? 
hey i 'm the one who kicked ivy 's botanical butt .   personally .   me .   i did . 
i 'm so sorry to trouble you but
of course dick grayson ward of the fabulously wealthy bruce wayne .  why would you need a few hundred dollars ? 
i guess the truth is i 'm just not comfortable with the idle rich .   even when they try to act like heroes . 
happy .   you honestly do n't know do you ?  you ca n't even see what 's in front of your own eyes . 
divide and conquer . 
i hate being lectured . 
of course .   he 's going to steal the giant white diamond . 
no robin .   he 's going to jail . 
or what ?   no one can capture ivy but the big bad bat .   crap !   you just want her for yourself .   do n't you ?   answer me damn it ! 
her name is pamela isley .   i saw her talking to gordon .   she must have stolen his keys altered the signal
she wants to kill you . 
i knew you could handle it . 
an enticing offer .   but what does the lady want in return ? 
let 's cool it for now .   there 's someone i want you to meet . 
i always go a size smaller .   makes me look slimmer . 
kill them .   of course .   but why stop there ?   why should only batman and robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished ? 
forget your frosty femme .   these lips are wet and ready to get frostbite . 
it 's a wonder you sleep at all . 
it 'll never work . 
take any three you like .  after you get settled we can .  .  .

it 's the car right ?  chicks love the car . 
excellent .  see .  who says a guy in a rubber suit ca n't be smart ?  well it 's been grand .  sorry you all have to die now . 
mr .  nygma you 'll forgive me for being rude .  but what exactly is on your mind ?

let me ask you something bruce .  what is man's greatest tool ? 
 .  .  . fired .  .  . your fired .  .  . your fired .  you understand ?  !  fired !  !

never heard of a doublecross ? 
a man with a death wish . 
miss . 
which bathroom is that sir ? 
respectfully sir .  .  .  there 'll never be another one like you . 
gosh i could kill you but then you 'd miss my party .  and you batman  you 're the guest of honor ! 
i just wanted to distract them .  i was n't trying to get a picture of you . 
i had to save you vicki .  i    please trust me . 
great .   give me a grant . 
i might consider it if you introduce me to miss vale . 
then stay away from vicki .  that 's all i want man .  i just want your word . 
 .  .  .  terror . 
very thoughtful .  do n't touch it . 
i do n't but .  .  .  i do .  it 's just .  .  .  i love you bruce .  i do n't want you to .  .  . 
he 'll be ready when you do .  remember what happened at the apartment . 
we 've told him we 'll deal .  what could he possible have to gain by 
a visual record yes .   a beforeand after kind of thing .   this could make your reputation . 
our next d . a .   i hear bruce wayne is throwing a fundraiser .   did you get your invitation yet ? 
well i 'm starving .   will you at least buy me a hamburger ? 
i bet they like him for his big charity balls . 
bruce wayne ?   date ?   he called you up and asked you for a date ?   shit .   hey miranda !   c 'mere !   now pay close attention to this .   miranda  tell my friend here what you told me about bruce wayne . 
something like this  what do you suppose this could drive a guy to ? 
allie .  .  .  he wants to tell me .  i had a roll of film .  his face was on it .  he knew that  and he let me keep . 
do n't ask him about work charlie .  life 's too short . 
sounds great .   excellent .   though ahm .  .  .  there 's this guy who 's coming to work at the gallery from england .  .  . 
yes there are hotels .   they just thought maybe it 'd be nice for him to stay with a real american family .   popcorn waffles all that stuff . 
david  are you ever going to learn to say no' ? 
that 's exactly what i said  .  .  .  before i said  great it 's a sensational idea . 
what 's wrong with you david ?   all you have to do is say excuse me i 've been sitting here since the start of the millennium and i 'd really like some action from you before the end of the world .  i 'll go . 
david i 'm serious ! 
yes .   andi have a wine for dinner that will kill you . 
sort of half .  .  .  .  .

ahm .  .  .  .  . 
what ?   what ? 
whistler was a great painter but he was n't a great chooser of paints  .  .  .  . 
thanks david .   always a pleasure . 
good point bernie  precisely the kind of perceptive interjection i 'd expect from my new v . p .  how can we you ask survive without whistler 's mother  our single greatest asset ?   well the truth is  we ca n't .   so what am i saying ?   will we find her again ?   never  this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius . 
i beg your pardon ? 
that 's one  way of looking at it .   you might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain' . 
well there is that  .  .  . 
bye bean .   thanks for everything .  and take care huh ?   i know it 's insane but i 'm going to miss you .

ah adam you do n't know anything about little girls .   she 's just .  .  .  missed out on some love that 's all .  .  . 
you can build another one .  .  .  with her . 
start simply .   do what you know .  use your talents .   practice .   we only help those who help themselves .  just do a little at a time .   and of course practice practice practice .   it 's tricky but  you were n't murderers by any chance were you ? 
bioubustingu .   i ulovesu biobusting .  who do i gotta kill ?   family  right ?   obnoxious i bet .   mommie daddy piglets .

yes i could stay here .  thank you . 
 .  .  .  oh .    .  .  .  my god i only wish that benjamin had your recuperative powers .  .  .  anyway the president offered to sit in for ben at the meeting quite a nice gesture i felt .  he 's due here soon i believe . 
not necessary but preferable .  i do n't think he 'll be a bother he seems like a most refreshing sort of man . 
yes he is different .  .  .  not the kind of person one usually meets in washington . 
how true .  mr .  gardiner may be a welcome change of pace . 
he 's very intense and internal do n't you think ? 
no eve .  .  .  i 'm sorry . 
he 's resting comfortably now .  there 's no cause for alarm yet .  .  . 
you really care for him do n't you eve ? 
i think we 'd better go look for him .   david ! 
gentlemen needless to say there is going to be a full congressional investigation of your respective operations .   good night . 
would you care to take it sir ? 
there 's no need for a hospital . 
these can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a todo over a simple little accident .  of course they can be very frightening and i must apologize for david he 's never had an accident before . 
i see .    .  .  .  say would you mind seeing our family doctor ? 
no .  i 'm a gardener . 
yes . 
i admire that in a person .  as for myself i find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times .  .  . 
yes . 
was he a relative ?  or an intimate friend ? 
 .  .  .  mentor .  .  .  ? 
of course . 
yes eve .  you 'll be all right . 
no thank you .

thank you . 
yes .  i 've been looking for you too eve . 
i 'm sorry to disturb you mr .  gardiner i know you must be very busy .

yes .  it 's a very good show .

i said  try again .

of course .  .  .  i 'm so sorry for you eve .  .  . 
he does talk like one but i think he 's brilliant . 
yes mr .  president we attempted to contact mr .  rand but he was too ill to .  .  . 
right chief . 
right chief . 
a coup d 'etat !  of course that was foreseen by lenin himself ! 
that is correct comrade skrapinov .  we have ascertained that gardiner heads a bigbusiness power group that will soon be taking over the american government . 
you have proven that already comrade skrapinov you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship . 
it 's so good to see you too ben you look terrific ! 
yes i did . 
i was was n't i ?   i was john fucking malkovich !   take me back craig .

the vacant office .  i see .  olive oil .  interesting .  be warned schwartz there are certain doors which should never be opened . 
yes .  unfortunately it 's bullshit .  the real story of 7 12 is so evil that it could never be revealed to americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors . 
i would n't know . 
no really . 
you know if you ever got me you would n't have a clue what to do with me .  that 's the thing romeo .

look if you really wanna score some dope i got the guy . 
excuse me ?

what are we doing here diego ?   this guy 's a clown .   he 's talking about clothes . 
i know .   she needs to slow down .   she 's going to blow an oring . 
i do n't like a lot of conversation diego . 
ah yes .   the murder . 
what kind of project ? 
twentysix months ?   for murder ?   i must be your lawyer . 
in my country i am a magico .   a man with a dream .   a man on the rise .   to take nothing and make it something okay ?   i have failed my dream but i will accomplish .   that is why i am in your country .   yes i lose my freedom .  but they do not take my dream .   do you have a dream george ? 
i would if i could get some sleep . 
george hallo !   today is the day ah ?  are you out ? 
okay . 
right .   now who is the person in california ?   the connection ? 
george we 've got sixtyone million dollars .   it 's either here or someplace else .   we 've got to put it somewhere .  unless you want to launder it . 
family . 
keep them coming ?   ah yes .   ha ha .   you are right .   but money . 
it is very difficult .   diego makes me a lot of money .   if diego goes so does the money .   you were an excellent teacher george .   when the student has learned well the teacher is no longer necessary .   we must remember we have wives friends familia .   even familia that has not been born .   but sometimes we must forget as well .   i am like you .  i must teach the lesson .   we want to teach the lesson .   but we cannot .   we must remember that life is the teacher . 
life will take care of everybody .  diego me you .   it is the teacher . 
i 'm sorry george . 
yeah dad .   i really did .   what am i gonna do ? 
tough spot . 
give it to her dad .   it 'll make her happy . 
that was a beautiful message . 
the setup is wrong .   we 're doing all the legwork and at the end of the day we 're still paying retail .   we 're getting middled . 
alright . 
please mirtha .   i 'll start working for augusto .   i 'll talk to him tonight .  i 'll do something . 
yeah you will .   of course . 
kristina 's fine . 
george he was n't asking . 
what 's happening to us ? 
yeah .   go out there check it out see what it 's like .   i 've got some stuff to do this week but i 'm thinking maybe thursday .   thursday after school . 
i know dad .   i love you too . 
do you see him here in the courtroom ? 
who 's the copilot ? 
you 're looking at him .   we provide the plane transportation cost u . s .  landing spot and take it to wherever you want it to go .   you provide the pick up point in south america and are responsible for payment .   you assume all the bust risks .   we take sixtyfive percent of all transportation fees ten percent of the gross plus our expenses .  this is not a negotiation so if this is okay with you we can talk further .   if not we can forget we had this conversation . 
they 're over at the booth . 
i do n't need a little .   i need a lot . 
do n't be such a pussy . 
the strike is a success but  .  .  . 
no they 'll do even more .  we 've given them the opportunity to do a lot more  .  .  .  do you understand what i mean ?  starting tomorrow they wo n't be groping in the dark any more every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy a selfconfessed criminal  .  .  .  and they will be able to pass to the offensive .  have you thought of this ? 
but kader told me that you were n't in favor of the strike . 
mathieu .  colonel mathieu . 
because it has n't all been erased . 
joe koehler .   i know him .   he 's an estate attorney  and he 's very expensive . 
an inquiry into what ? 
then you can go . 
cause ? 
the official cause of death was a cardiac arrest . 
but there 's more ? 
we know marsh had a head cold .    we found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand .   the coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant but for a much shorter time .   he 'd keep using more and more  never knowing what he was taking . 
then how did it get into his body ? 
yes  those of mr .  marsh and a thumb print of miss lawson's . 
did miss lawson and mr .  marsh ever argue ? 
could you be more specific ? 
no  never . 
no .   miss lawson came in here voluntarily to answer your questions .  she does n't have to sit here and be insulted .   so either you charge her now or we 're leaving . 
she planned this .   she wanted us to find the nasal spray . 
your honor  please ! 
your honor i 'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal miss lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was . 
mr .  marsh 's cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied mr .  marsh to their office on at least two occasions . 
rebecca lawson . 
you would n't know her address would you ? 
did you ever see mr .  marsh use cocaine ? 
did mr .  marsh change his lifestyle after that ? 
i had bypass surgery . 
well  i think that after the operation she realized that .  .  . 
i do n't know .   it 's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that  but if anyone could it would be rebecca . 
yes  cocaine . 
i was jealous .   of course i was hurt .  he switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with .   but i did n't kill him . 
no !   why would i want to kill him ? 
yes . 
because he called me . 
and she left shortly after that ? 
you must have some feeling .   some immediate impression .   a young attractive woman involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will .   and the things that went on in that house .   such wild sex .   what kind of picture does that paint ? 
not a very good one i 'm afraid . 
those same men will be sitting on the jury . 
why not ? 
because  somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it . 
yes  she did . 
no  i wanted to be a professional hockey player . 
i broke my ankle skating .   that ended that dream . 
is that what you think i was thinking ? 
that 's not good enough goddamit ! 
i do n't use cocaine anymore .   if she says she saw me doing it she 's lying . 
i do n't know frank  but do n't you think that 's something we should find out ? 
paley could be a problem tomorrow . 
are you scared ? 
to celebrate how masterfully you destroyed roston today . 
rebecca  we shattered a man's life in open court . 
he was only doing what he thought was right . 
so sue me .   things have changed .   i think you should go home  and after you leave i see no reason for us to ever have contact again . 
i 'm supposed to be on vacation . 
six thirty  and he was very much alive . 
you said it in that tone !  like you were angry at me my brother at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch ! 
well there 's a lot of boring stuff to do .  lists of people we have to write to .  find mama 's relatives addresses in italy  stuff like that . 
lawyer here ? 
do n't talk to me like that .  she was my mother for christsakes .  and now i find out she was .  .  .  she was a  ! 
do n't say that ! 
no .  we 're going to lock this up and 
only about a thousand times .  what do i do now ?  what 's good enough for mom is good enough for me ? 
what gets me is i 'm 46 years old .  i 've been in this crummy fucking marriage 
carolyn ! 
no what ? 
no .  what a tragedy .  what happened ? 
she changed . 
well i did n't know they was a secret club . 
no . 
after the divorce . 
oh yeah bari .  i 've been there . 
i guess .  except i 'm one of the people it frightens . 
italy to iowa ?  i 'd call that a change . 
richard was in the army .  i met him while i was living in naples .  i did n't know where iowa was .  i only cared that it was america .  and of course being with richard . 
clean ? 
yes .  very clean . 
i think so . 
making pictures .  i like that .  you really love what you do do n't you ? 
you sound like an artist . 
well let 's just call it a compliment and move on .   did you love teaching ? 
they have safaris for tourists now .  maybe you can convince your husband . 
umm i do n't know .  i can look it up . 
i embrace mystery .  i do n't know what 's coming .  and i do n't mind . 
but no one in particular . 
what ? 
you wo n't be made to feel !  period .  you 've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you 've touched our lives !  well go to hell !  it is n't human not to feel lonely  it is n't human not to afraid !  you 're a hypocrite and you 're a phony !

i do n't want to know 
my name is lenore oberfeld . 
do n't lay this on me ! 
then hang up !   do it ! 
no  nothing . 
i 'm in traffic .   there 's no place to turn . 
i hear them coming upstairs .   i wo n't be able to talk for awhile .  i have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep .   so do n't talk .   do n't say a word or they 'll hear it . 
they just walked out .   the smaller man  he must be dominican or haitian  he kicked me so hard .  i felt a rib crack but i never made a sound .   it 's starting to hurt now  real bad .   a throbbing .   i ca n't even take a deep breath . 
forget who i am .   where 's this school located ? 
what about the others ? 
they say she resembles me  dark hair ponytail very dark eyes .  they all wear the same uniform .   please .   be careful .   the man driving the car must have a gun . 
it never healed .   i called her a lying bitch and everything else and i hung up on her .   click .  you do n't exist . 
and that was the end of it ? 
i sure as hell got my wish .   she does n't exist .   so maybe you reached the appropriate person after all . 
i 'm sorry if i caused you to lose your business deal . 
they say my work is somewhat derivative . 
i was n't always like that .   i do n't think i was . 
i can hear you again clearly . 
she 's gone 
that 's why we 're turning off onto a fire road . 
wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed . 
that 's where this chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas .   i could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me . 
as a child i hated being told how sweet i looked .   that angelic little face was n't me at all .   i had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image .  sometimes words were enough  but i was n't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously .   i enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who i was .   that same look you gave me when i turned the gun on you . 
he let the fucking cop out  but he wo n't 
turns out you did me a favor .  you 're looking at a rich man . 
twenty percent . 
you can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land jack there in federal prison .   he ca n't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence . 
we can be there . 
i wish it had never been invented . 
it 's your call . 
and then ? 
she 's yours .   what are we waiting on ? 
you want us to get ourselves killed ? 
and i end up in a fucking neck brace for life ! 
i thought you 'd know me by now . 
why would she want me to think you were on ice ? 
my compensation !   somebody still owes me  big time ! 
how do you know ? 
i 've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards . 
them .   they wo n't be expecting us . 
was i picking on you ?   how come you pulled in back of this fruitstand ? 
if you 've already killed her that 's fine .   i 'll keep the bonds and the cash .   we got nothing to discuss . 
well you get to say the usual col .  things like that . 
so who 's he ? 
he 's what she should run a mile from . 
he gave me a look . 
yeah ? 
nice . 
what would you call it ? 
i would expect he does . 
maybe .

can i at least keep the onion soup ? 
yes .  the five men .  they were of course your husband charles the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday and carson dyle .  but something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact .  it must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money .

you must n't let what he said bother you .  it was only words .

we will separate  you look over there . 
i 'm lisa sherman .  dylan's aunt .  he asked me to come talk to you .

there 's a lisa shermer living just sixty miles west of here .  over the indiana border .  i 'm going . 
no .  i 'll handle this . 
no ? 
she just turned off her light . 
people always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements .  all the weirdness in this house took place in the basement . 
i was grounded for two fucking months because of you ! 
but you ca n't do any of it .  so it sucks .  i always have to set an example' . 
personally i think he has a deep almost pathological desire to corrupt you .  but i suppose that 's a type of love .  i certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me . 
no ?  ! 
what party ? 
twenty eight years ago . 
not at all .  in fact i thought about going . 
you 're sweet .  i really wish someone had thrown a party like that when i was your age .  my life might have been very different . 
three of our classmates are dead .  that 's not really the occasion for a party . 
i do n't know .  i kind of am . 
and when i finally agree to spread my legs you accuse me of treating you like meat . 
i 'm scared .  three kids are dead .  i want to go to this party . 
i 'm not leaving .  i want to know why you and dad are so freaked out .  three of my classmates are dead . 
she was raped .  at least that 's what she claimed . 
they were proving to her they were n't .  they were very drunk .  things were different back then .  you think kids are sexually bottled up today .  .  .  . 
you 're not telling me something . 
there 's going to be very few virgins left in school on monday .  it could be really dangerous for them if the killer is n't caught .

if you were a bank president that would be one thing but in your business it 's admirable .  and it 's good advertising . 
but i 'm surprised you 're still working for her unless she 's suddenly come up with another husband . 
would you call him a capable man ? 
very . 
that 's too bad . 
mainly that you 're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers . 
his girlfriend ? 
yes his girlfriend . 
maybe . 
i 'll look into it as soon as i check out some avocado groves . 
i 've got her .

i do n't . 
let me show you something . 
how did she .  .  .    .  .  . happen to have them ? 
what pictures ? 
if your husband was killed it was .   this can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence . 
i do n't see anyone for very long mr .  gittes .   it 's difficult for me .  now i think you know all you need to about me .  i did n't want publicity .  i did n't want to go into any of this then or now .  is this all ? 
what dam ? 
the one your husband opposed .  they 're conning l . a .  into building it only the water wo n't go to l . a .  it 'll go here . 
in the last three months robert knox has bought 7000 acres emma dill 12000 acres clarence speer 5000 acres and jasper lamar crabb 25000 acres . 
it 's why he was killed .  jasper lamar crabb .  jasper lamar crabb .

your eye . 
 .  .  . yes sort of a birthmark .  .  . 
he owns it .  you know ? 
that you were jealous and he was worried about what you might do . 
it 's possible .

did n't you talk to a man here .  .  .  few days ago .  .  .  wore glasses .  .  .  he .  .  . 
all she needed for that was the phone book ! 
they 're all a bunch of phonies . 
jake it 's chinatown .  they 're all over the place .  you oughta know better . 
nothing .  you got a hell of a way to make a living . 
you must be thinking of a different daughter . 
no he 's only got one i remember her age i read it in the newspapers when she ran away . 
why 'd she run away ? 
what is it what is it ?  what 's the picture ? 
heeey !  totooooo !  do n't get pissed off with me now !  come here !  i do n't know where the fuck i have to go .   and the next time be careful how you talk .  not to take credit away from the lord but if i had created the world in all modesty certain things would have come out better .  but unfortunately such was not the case . 
you see it s like i say .  you always have an answer for everything . 
i want to make you happy toto !  i 'm going to tell you a story .   once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm .  basta one of the guards saw the king 's daughter she was the loveliest of all !  and he immediately fell in love with her .  but what could a poor soldier do compared with a king 's daughter ?  !  .  .  . one day he managed to meet her and told her he could n't live without her .  the princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  if you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony then in the end i 'll be yours . christ the soldier ran off there and waited !  one day two days ten twenty .  .  . every night she looked out of her window but he never budged .  come rain wind snow never budged !  the birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive !  after ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he could n't hold them back .  he did n't even have the strength to sleep any more .  the princess kept watch .  .  . and on the ninetyninth night the soldier got up picked up his chair and left ! 
just so alfredo .  there is n't any .  and if you buy a television set you can watch it at home without any fuss .  .  . 
you were expecting her ?  huh ?    .  .  . it 's a nasty business waiting by yourself .  in company it 's better .  no ?  .  .  . then i 'll leave . 
no .  and nobody knows where she is . 
who said that ?  gary cooper james stewart henry fonda ?  huh ?  
whatever you do love it like you loved that projection booth of the paradiso when you were little .  .  .  
hi .  why are you running ? 
we 'll talk about that later . 
he wo n't be convinced salvatore .  he has other plans for me . 
politics .  he 's the district representative .  we met at the university in pisa . 
somebody stole it . 
the projector 's all rusty but i could fix it in two or three days .  give the place a good cleaning put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we 'll show catene in two houses .

hello bernstein . 
thank you mr carter .   this is mr .  leland . 
how do you do mr .  bernstein ? 
as a matter of fact we sent a man to the silverstone home yesterday afternoon .   our man even arrived before the chronicle reporter .   and there 's no proof that the woman was murdered  or even that she 's dead . 
that 's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on mr .  carter .   right now i wish you 'd send your best man up to see mr .  silverstone .   have him tell mr .  silverstone if he does n't produce his wife at once the enquirer will have him arrested .   have him tell mr .  silverstone he 's a detective from the central office .  if mr .  silverstone asks to see his badge your man is to get indignant and call mr .  silverstone an anarchist .  loudly so that the neighbors can hear . 
it is accepted mr .  carter with assurances of my deepest regard . 
exactly according to your instructions mr .  kane .   we 've got two spreads of pictures . 
yes  mr .  kane .

i was referring to myself .   i thought we might have a picnic tomorrow  it might be a nice change after the wild west party tonight .   invite everybody to go to the everglades 
invite everybody !   order everybody you mean and make them sleep in tents !   who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own  with their own bath where they know where everything is ? 
i 'm not sorry . 
i 'm not a gentleman mrs .  kane and your husband is just trying to be funny calling me one .   i do n't even know what a gentleman is .   you see my idea of a gentleman mrs .  kane  well if i owned a newspaper and if i did n't like the way somebody else was doing things  some politican say  i 'd fight them with everything i had .   only i would n't show him in a convict suit with stripes  so his children could see the picture in the paper .   or his mother .   it 's pretty clear  i 'm not a gentleman . 
it 'll be our first foreign war in fifty years brad .   we 'll cover it the way the hickville gazette covers the church social !   the names of everybody there what they wore what they ate who won the prizes who gave the prizes   i tell you brad i envy you .   by bradford leland the enquirer 's special correspondent at the front .  i 'm almost tempted 
but there is no front charlie .  there 's a very doubtful civil war .  besides i do n't want the job . 
they do it only because you do ! 
i mean i 've got a job for you . 
you 're wrong .   it does make a difference to you   rector 's brad ?   come to think of it i do n't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent .   you wo n't miss anything .   it is n't much of a war .  besides they tell me there is n't a decent restaurant on the whole island . 
look out that window . 
i 'd like to talk to you about that . 
no that wo n't help .   besides you never get drunk .   i wanted to talk about you and emily . 
sure i am .   she wants full custody of the child no matter what happens .  if you wo n't agree to that she 'll apply for a divorce regardless of the president 's wishes .   i ca n't tell her she 's wrong because she is n't wrong 
the personal note is all there is to it .   it 's all there ever is to it .   it 's all there every is to anything !   stupidity in our government complacency and selfsatisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong  you ca n't fight those things impersonally .  they 're not impersonal crimes against people .   they 're being done by actual persons  with actual names and positions and  the right of the american people to own their own country is not an academic issue brad that you debate  and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers . 
what do you mean by that ? 
that 's the train with all the lights . 
yes . 
the bank 's decision in all matters concerning his education his place of residence and similar subjects will be final .  
how do you do charles ? 
but do n't you think if we release it now  he 's only been dead four days  it might be better than if 
millions  if anybody wants it . 
the banks are out of luck eh ? 
oh i do n't know .   they 'll clear all right . 
think again ! 
i 'd rather you just talked .   anything that comes into your mind  about yourself and mr .  kane . 
he was in love with me .   but he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us  and he lost the election and that norton woman divorced him . 
what about that apartment ? 
he wanted me to be comfortable  oh why should i bother ?   you do n't believe me but it 's true .   it just happens to be true .   he was really interested in my voice .   what are you smiling for ?   what do you think he built that opera house for ?   i did n't want it .   i did n't want to sing .   it was his idea  everything was his idea  except my leaving him . 
i feel kind of sorry for him all the same 
do n't you think i do ?   you say you 're going down to xanadu ? 
are you serious ? 
you 're shittin' me . 
unnhh ! 
this ?  how long have you been smoking ? 
the ones in this town yes !  you encourage their growth their habit .  you 're the source in this area and we 're going to shut you down for good !  for good cancermerchant ! 
you 'd think she was marrying him .  what are you watching ? 
you 're kidding . 
such a sordid state of affair . 
and i 'm caught in the middletorn between my loyalty for the boss and my desire to piss with the light on . 
he was ? 
dante .  you 've got a customer . 
let 's not talk about that .  how 'd you get home ? 
you saw it ? 
i 'm not pregnant . 
i know i 'm sorry .  but when we started talking .  .  .  it 's like i forgot i had a boyfriend .  and then he proposed last month .  .  . 
i would 've told you and you would have stopped calling like a baby . 
no you 're not really getting married ? 
the story goes like this he proposed and i told him i had to think about it and he insisted i wear the ring anyway .  then my mother told the paper we were engaged . 
thanks for the vote of confidence . 
you do n't have anything to do with it . 
i just believe in giving credit where credit is due .  and i believe that i 'm the impetus behind your failure to wed . 
i hear that 's a rather popular date . 
where 'd he go ?   i 'd have thought he 'd be at your side like an obedient lapdog . 
when you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything . 
so ? 
you called caitlin again ? 
party at john k 'ssenior year .  i get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom .  caitlin comes in and dives all over me . 
that girl was vile to you . 
chess team allan harris ?  ! 
i think it 's safe to say yes . 
well he 's like the pope for the dark side of the force .  he 's a holy man a shaman kind of albeit an evil one . 
hence the empire was a fascist theocracy and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution . 
and the second one was still being built when they blew it up . 
basically . 
so when they blew it up no prob .  evil is punished . 
he 's the guy in those nudiebooth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off . 
can we talk about this later ? 
why not ? 
shut up !   yes i 've calmed down i 'm still not happy about it but i 've been able to deal . 
smokey three thumbs up am i right ? 
not a fucking word !  slippery shit ! 
what ? 
i do n't back down . 
i 'm going to miss the game . 
one ball !  !  they come all the way here .  .  .  i close the damn store .  .  .  for one ball ! 
hockey 's hockey .  at least we got to play . 
i have n't seen her in almost two years . 
shit .  what about tomorrow ? 
one night only .  she 's buried in the morning . 
an embarrassing way to die . 
oh my god . 
who found him ? 
he made it hunhh ? 
i 'm telling you it was n't my fault ! 
so the casket fell over !  big deal ! 
let me borrow your car . 
not yet .  
and two to make a point title does not dictate behavior . 
what 'd you rent ?   best of both worlds ? 
i got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor . 
i swear .  i could n't make this kind of hell up . 
you 're happy to get a fine ? 
i 'm not .  she just left . 
what did she say ? 
in my absence try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns . 
i think four . 
what responsibility ? 
oh like your life 's any better ? 
who 're you kidding ?  you can so . 
why do you say that ? 
what time did you get to work today ? 
like ten after . 
i 'll call you .  let you know . 
i know i can bench more than that ! 
caitlin used to talk about him all the time . 
oh i do .  you made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash .  your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized . 
yes they are .  you 're out of shape . 
wow .  that 's great .  that 's something to be proud of . 
we went out a few times .  we did n't have sex but we fooled around . 
something like thirtysix . 
 .  .  . and one of those guys was you !  the last one i might add whichif you 're too stupid to comprehend means that i 've been faithful to you since we met !  all the other guys i went with before i met you so if you want to have a complex about it go ahead !   but do n't look at me like i 'm the town whore because you were plenty busy yourself before you met me ! 
because going down it 's a big deal !  i used to like a guy we 'd make out and sooner or later i 'd go down on him .  but i only had sex with the guys i loved . 
and that made you feel better ? 
you could n't get these shutters open ? 
a couple .  .  .  ? 
they oughta put some kind of warning on these cans like they do with cigarettes . 
what ? 
you said you were here all day ? 
scumbag .  what are you doing ? 
now feel his .   roll up your sleeve chief . 
because he 's out of shape . 
well how about these two movies ?  
you 'll be missed . 
for this kind of hash you need that kind of cash . 
i 'm not sad . 
you 're not ? 
after all that i 've done for that fuck !  and he wants to be with that slut ?  fine !  he can have his slut ! 
um do you think you can give me a lift home tonight ?

a simple yes or no would have done . 
cute . 
breathtaking .

next time date only basketball players .

i 'm holding you to that .   gabe what about frank ? 
enough 's enough .   how could anybody in their right mind .  .  .  then again you never were in your right mind . 
we 're not animals but do n't force us to be .   walk over . 
there .   you blind ? 
somehow i did n't think you 'd wait for me if i 'd sent it first . 
the monitor !  i never ask twice . 
there what 's that place ? 
sorry em i wanted it to be like .  .  .  a big surprise for you and pee . 
just a manner of speech sir . 
a big black mark i tell you for every one we do n't reclaim .  a confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole . 
that 's just worries me .  a bit too long to long to be reasonable .  you 're about due now by my reckoning that 's why i 'm warning you little alex to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt .  do i make myself clear ? 
not true sir .  it was only a slight tolchock .  she was breathing i swear it . 
it 's alright thank you . 
um .  .  .  oh no sir not exactly i still feel very miserable very much down in spirits . 
brother you think and talk sometimes like a little child .  tonight we pull a mansize crast . 
good .  real horrorshow .  initiative comes to them as waits .  i 've taught you much my little droogies .  now tell me what you have in mind georgie boy . 
oh the old molokoplus first would you not say
thank you very much .  thank you my dear .  girl bows and exits to loud applause . 
as an unmuddied lake fred .  as clear as an azure sky of deepest summer .  you can rely on me fred . 
fine fine . 
aye that 's joe .  he .  .  .  ummmm lives here now .  the lodger .  that 's what he is .  .  .  he .  .  .  he rents your room .  alex confronts joe . 
what 's gonna happen to me then ?  i mean that 's my room he 's in  there 's no denying that .  this is my home also .  what suggestions have you my pee and em to make ? 
well all this needs thinking about son .  i mean we ca n't very well just kick joe out .  .  .  not just like that can we ?  i mean joe is here doing a job .  a contract it is two years .  well we made like an arrangement did n't we joe ?  you see son joe 's paid next month 's rent already so well whatever we do in the future we cant just say to joe to get out now can we ? 
 .  .  .  because i do n't like you horrible type do i and if you want to start something .  .  .  if you want to start .  .  .  go on .  .  .  well you just start .  please do .  alex retching . 
alexander de large sir . 
right carry on .  alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk . 
do you mean church of england ? 
do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses ? 
something like that . 
i imagine you 'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day .  but we have to be hard on you .  you have to be cured . 
no .  .  .  i 'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them alright ? 
ohhh .  .  .  jolly good .  perhaps you can explain me something to me first . 
now then each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture .  you 'll tell me what you think the person would say .  alright ? 
good .  it wa your fault .  .  .  you sold me a crummy watch .  i want my money back . 
good .  you can do whatever you like with these . 
i was quite enjoying that . 
it 's not that kind of a test .  but you seem well on the way to a complete recovery . 
yes !  !  ! 
ohhhh !  !  !  go on do me in you bastard cowards .  i do n't want to live anyway not in a stinking world like this . 
it 's a stinking world because there 's no law and order any more .  it 's a stinking world because it lets the young get onto the old like you done .  it 's no world for an old man any more .  what sort of a world is it at all ?  men on the moon and men spinning around the earth and there 's not no attention paid to earthly law and order no more .  the tramp starts singing again . 
this is the poisonous young swine that near done me in .  him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me .  alex breaks away again . 
no father .  it 's nothing like that father .  it 's about this new thing they 're all talking about .  about this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again . 
i do n't care about the danger father .  i just want to be good .  i want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness . 
the question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good .  goodness comes from within .  goodness is chosen .  when a man cannot chose he ceases to be a man . 
be patient my son and put your trust in the lord . 
have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness ? 
carry on chief . 
sir . 
answer when the governor asks you a question you filthy young swine ! 
no i do n't know luv i 'd taken my sleepers . 
i agree sir .  what we need are larger prisons .  more money . 
not a chance my dear fellow .  the ggovernment ca n't be concerned any longer with outmoded penological theories .  soon we may be needing all of out prison space for political offenders .  common criminals like these are best dealt with on a purely curative basis .  kill the criminal reflex that 's all .  full implementation in a year 's time .  punishment means nothing to them you can see that .  .  .  they enjoy their socalled punishment .  alex seizes his chance as they pass by . 
sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day . 
sure .   i 'm starting an 800 hotline .   caught part of your phone call .   and even if i had n't there 's the dark pinstripe armani elegant not too hip which rules out advertising plus a topoftheline briefcase that you live out of looks like bottega .  .  . 
 .  .  . bottega .   guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher 's mask i think he 's a ballplayer .   you ?   definitely clarence darrow . 
like you i 'm good at it .   but at this exact moment in time .  .  . like i gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning . 
you need a vacation . 
not in a cab .  .  .   i mean a disconnection .  .  . get your head straight .  .  . you know get it together .  .  . 
sure thing . 
no no uwaitu .  .  . 
where are you what floor ? 
yes !   stay put goddamn it !   do n't move from that spot .  .  . 
this vehicle 's not safe to drive .  we 're gonna have to impound it .   get you towed .   step away from the vehicle and pop the trunk .   i 'm sorry sir you 'll have to find another cab . 
save me the grief .   step out of the car sir and open the trunk . 
you sure ?   you look pretty shaky .  .  . 
jesus .  .  . 
was it great ?   better than great it had to be .  .  . 
oh we working for the feds now ?   if my snitch flew out a window he 's got dmitri 's handprints on his ass .  that makes it homicide that makes it ours . 
cabbie had no criminal record no history of mental illness .   suddenly he just wigs out and pops three people then himself ?   plus the victims were n't random solid citizens .  they were all lowlives .   wiseguys .   i 've always wondered if there was someone else in the cab . 
this is n't our goddamn game ! 
of course i 'm proud .   you know he started with nothing ?   look at him today .   playing concerts . 
you could n't pick up a phone ?   i 'm lying here wondering if something horrible happened .  .  . 
i 'll fuck you up you do n't hand it over . 
what happens if you do n't ? 
maaaaaax ! 
 .  .  . what do you want me to do punch him out ?   i have to work with him .  .  . 
i see your point . 
you should start a union . 
i 'm cool . 
with what ? 
the trunk ? 
i think so . 
they 're usomebody 'su friends .  .  .   you drive a cab .   i kill people .   we both do our jobs right you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead . 
i need the job . 
am i collateral ? 
that what we 're doing ?   flowing ? 
you 're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow .   you like the man you like the way he plays .   how about a little jazz huh ? 
do n't even think you 're walking away from me . 
sure ?   like you did n't play him ?  string him along ?   if he had gotten the answer right would you have let him go ? 
the f . b . i .  the c . i . a .   you name the initials and they 're down there . 
look i 'm sorry 
you know flip vietnam war was fought because of a bet howard hughes lost to aristotle onasis . 
johnny dancer .   you 've been in my office ten times .   how come you never asked me about that picture before ? 
you 're the boss .   just do n't make me repeat myself .   i hate that . 
you were there jerry .   figure it out . 
love . 
arf .  .  .  you gotta help me . 
that 's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out .   a lot of people are after you jerry . 
people more serious about their work .  you know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it ? 
that 's how a man would do it .   i 'm not a man . 
nothing is easy . 
yeah .   i think so . 
never heard of him . 
it made me feel like you could see inside of me .   and i do n't know how that 's possible . 
is this your dad ? 
is he dead ? 
please put it down . 
what van ? 
i put an ad on a computer bulletin board .   i log on at the library so i ca n't be traced . 
there are all kinds of groups all kinds of initials .   but they 're all part of two warring factions .  one  families that have held wealth for centuries .  they want one thing .   stability .  group two  the boat rockers .  eisenhower 's military industrial complex .   they want instability .  it 's a trillion dollar a year business .   when there is n't a hot war they make a cold one . 
latest casualty ?   ernest harriman .  you heard of him ? 
it said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool .   uin newportu . 
what was he doing down here ?   a billionaire waiting for the subway ?   why not drown him in a bus ?   why drown him at all ?   why not shoot him ?   is the hitman from the lost world of atlantis ?   i mean come on . 
those are song lyrics jerry . 
if you were eating kentucky fried chicken and drinking cocacola again . 
it 's geronimo .   love .  it lets you see things .   it gives you insight .  i 've loved you since the first time i saw you . 
then tell me what happened . 
you do ? 
we 're very specialized . 
brain washing mind control that sort of thing ? 
it was mind control .   umanchurianu ucandidateu kind of stuff right ? 
a vulgar pop term but yes .   take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin .   that was our goal . 
m . k .  ultra was terminated in 1973 .  but not the research .  it was renamed .   ex catcher . 
i am impressed .   we used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card . 
these things you 're talking about .  you did them to jerry ? 
i do n't believe you . 
i need to speak with an agent lowry . 
you do n't understand 
was n't my idea . 
i 'm going to find him .   because he 'd find me . 
what do you suggest ? 
yes sir . 
and only two probabilities  one there is intelligent life in the universe but they 're so far away you 'll never contact it in your lifetime 
what if you 're wrong ?   no  i 'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence  you ca n't deny the possibility  and i believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly .  .  .  profound is worth investigation  and worth taking a few risks . 
oh ?   how 's he doing ? 
no doubt . 
ellie .  .  . 
with me . 
apparently he 's genuinely interested in science .   this could be a chance to win him over . 
ellie . 
this .  .  .  seemed best . 
how soon will you be able to decode it ? 
kent kent for chrissakes .   you must be eleanor . 
no !   i mean .  .  .  why so soon ? 
ellie .  .  .  this is the way it 's been done for billions of years .  .  . 
what are you talking about ?   it 's over . 
you sound like joseph .   you think the world ends with the millennium ? 
it 's beautiful but it does get a little lonely .   sometimes i think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places is n't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we 're all such pathetic antisocial misfits .  .  .  speaking of which  how 're you getting on with the old man ? 
yavol . 
it 's like the precopernicans who swore the sun revolved around the earth or the victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made .   i mean .  .  .  try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us  then imagine trying to explain .  .  .  i dunno a microwave oven  to someone even a hundred years ago  i mean the basic concepts did n't exist .  .  . 
thirtyone linked dishes .   you could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here . 
but what about your research   ? 
and you think i do n't want those things ?   you think i do n't stay up half the night wondering if i 've made the right choice living half a world away from you wondering if any of this is worth what i 'm giving up for it everyday ?   let 's get married . 
i 'm serious about this peter 
you sonofabitch . 
i 'm  i 'm fine . 
i 'd have to say i do n't know enough to have one yet .   for the moment i do n't believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive . 
and what would you have done if the odds had gone against you ? 
well it 's been a while but i do n't recall the bible saying too much about alien civilizations . 
that 's not faith it 's physics .   the second law of thermodynamics . 
so if i let the pendulum go when it swings back you would n't flinch . 
i thought it was wellwritten .  heartfelt .   and a little bit naive .  .  .  but that 's just the enemy 's perspective . 
did you ever stop to think that maybe that is n't science 's fault but meaning 's ? 
i do n't follow . 
oh .   i brought you something . 
i 'm assuming you read my deposition . 
ellie the only one holding you to that standard is you !   the people want to hear your story they need to hear it ! 
ellie .  .  .  if you go out there like this  if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced did n't actually happen  i 'm afraid they really will crucify you .   please .   for your own sake for the sake of the world .  .  .  tell them what you know to be the truth .   tell them it really happened . 
i 'm not sure .  .  .   maybe it simply exists in the search for it .   maybe its something we have to make for ourselves . 
meaning .  .  . 
nobody is proposing we censor the truth here doctor .   we 're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place 
i do n't think you understand .  we made a deal 
but i made this arrangement 
it was n't his fault .  nobody said anything about seats .  we 
oh i had me some high old times .  yore old man luke was n't much for stickin' around but damn it he made me laugh . 
no . 
she took off with that convertible feller .  .  . 
nothin' to do with it .  i ai n't never give john the kind of feelin' i give you so i 'm payin' him off now .  do n't feel you got to say anything .  way it is sometimes you just have a feelin' for a child or you do n't and with john i just did n't . 
i kin see that brick head .  i mean your hole card . 
it 'd go to your coconut head .  you 'd start getting ideas .  maybe even pass right out . 
the man wants speed let 's give it to him .  ram it in and break it off .  go hard .  shag it . 
'atsa sign i got me an affectionate nature . 
knock it off luke !  you cai n't talk about him that way . 
on my own . 
like i always do ? 
maybe we oughta call you noears .  you do n't listen much do you boy ? 
one rule !  no throwing up .  he throws up you forfeit everything . 
that fool .  that damn fool .

what did i do ? 
you threatened to drive her downtown .   she has agoraphobia . 
open space .   she has n't been out of this apartment in three years .   i did n't used to think it was real .  .  . 
when was the last time you washed your hair ? 
no that 's still in my jacket i was wearing .   we were supposed to meet on the docks that number 47 wharf 10 o 'clock friday .   he 's gonna hand me 500 bucks . 
what day is this ?   in jail you lose track .   this week .   friday . 
the door was already open .  .  .

i sent it by private courier he did n't give it to you ?   that son of a gun .  .  .  ! 
bet you never figured i 'd follow in your footsteps .   it 's real well written .   you should read it  you 're in it . 
that klutz .   they send him back here i 'll kick his ass good . 
for months .  .  .  last october . 
it 's too big a file to copy to a disk . 
show what ?   it 's gone .   he wrote a self destruct virus into the code so it would only play until we try to copy it .   then it erased itself .  gone .  .  .   do you remember what you saw ? 
injected windex !   why would he switch to a new m . o .  ? 
ah if you knew that you 'd be half way to nailing him .   serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive .   this guy has a plan all thought out flexible and complex .   he 's playing a game with us .   who will he imitate next ?  maybe he 's doing all the serial killers in history the great innovators the murderers' hall of fame .   just to prove he 's better than all of them .   they got caught he did n't . 
you betrayed me !   now every psychopath in the city knows i 'm back in business .  .  .  you lied to me ! 
because i 'm all you 've got . 
it 's not chronological son of sam was before hillside . 
they 're not talking to me .   saks looks right through me .   i ask him for some bodies for the phones  he 's so encouraging you make that uyouru little job .   condescending bastard .   helen on your lists to call is san quentin .   daryll lee cullum ? 
a man ?   i thought he was a boy .   this last christmas was the happiest christmas i had in the last ten years .  .  .  you know why ?   it was the first christmas in six years i was not in love .   son of a bitch umarried menu !   who cares about marriage the bed just gets crowded and noisy ?  ! 
where 's the john ?   let me clean up this mess and get back to work . 
i 've got to go .   i 've ugotu to go . 
this has been the worst 48 hours of my life .   i 'm going home .   i 'm going to try to get drunk . 
maryjane .   you think that logic and police procedure order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night .   i did once .  but you know how he 'll get caught ?  he 'll have an accident or some cop will get lucky .   you ca n't catch him by being intelligent and working hard .   or the worst  there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way month after month .   the news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows and hurry home before dark .   and then one day there are no more .   what happened ?   did he just stop ?   get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more ?  did he kill himself ?   did he die in an auto accident ?   or a fight .   or get sick and die ?   it 's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth .   and you never know .   but you keep asking yourself  when you read about a new murder  is he back ? 
that would be much appreciated .  thanks . 
will you stay ?   please ?   i 'm afraid to sleep .  .  .  i do n't want .  .  . uhimu .  .  . in my head .  .  . 
they taught me at the fbi .   i was very good at it .   it scared me .  .  .  i liked it . 
am i in charge of this thing ?   or not . 
how about i put nikko on it ? 
i 'm checking out anybody who lives like desalvo .   records of arrests for rape especially by a man wearing green .   checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile .   cross check ing names from arrests for sexual offenses public fondling .   if they 've got a german wife .   we can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years and this guy 's going to hit again soon . 
i gotta have ruben and a .  .  . 
how 'd you get in on the deal ? 
she lies all the time .   why would i say i fed her if i did n't ? 
how can you drive ?  james .  .  .  your legs .  you can barely walk . 
maybe i am a little .   james i 've got to leave for the office .  are you going to be all right ? 
do you find him attractive ? 
at home .  i could n't face all this traffic . 
it 's not here .  maybe the police are still holding it .  their forensic people .  .  . 
not yet  though not soon enough for some people i 've already found .  a death in the doctor 's family makes the patients doubly uneasy . 
look at all this traffic .  i 'm not sure i can deal with it . 
yes . 
i live in my car .  this is my workshop . 
you could get your wish at any moment . 
i did this already . 
yeah and a dimple . 
i apologize for the inconvenience but i must ask you some .  .  . 
we 'll see about adjusting the dosage if that does n't clear in the next  how are other things going ? 
well letty this does present a liability issue for the hospital . 
go ahead and put the guard back up letty .  but you need to know what you 're dealing with . 
then that 's even more reason to listen .  look schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality .  they experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes .  
and then the gold scroll or the black romanesque print ? 
that 's thanks to all your help . 
i 'm sorry .  i 'm so sorry . 
i was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask . 
do n't forget that paul 's a promising young attorney who loves you very much .  .  . 
and if i want to smoke i 'll fucking smoke . 
it 's good exercise mom . 
sounds awful .  i guess we better check it out . 
i guess so .  i think that 's right . 
it 's ok .  it 's not a passfail kind of thing . 
no . 
what about patterns ?  do you find yourself checking and rechecking locks ?  or washing your hands over and over again ? 
sometimes my food and my clothes and my underwear . 
is this really important ?  because i do n't think it 's a problem . 
you have no right no right to take the worst thing that 's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game . 
i wo n't do your portion of kitchen cleanup . 
the lady knows this is a dandelion . 
wow .     i 'm bad news . 
what 's my rap ? 
sure .  but i took out a whole grocery store . 
i just want to see beast .   where would you go ? 
i do n't like lamb . 
very trendy .  let 's see the rest . 
it was n't exactly a lie . 
what ? 
letty please . 
that 's the best idea i 've heard in a long time . 
you should go . 
you just need to get more organized .  l
yeah i guess it 's all right . 
this has been really difficult this whole thing .  
of course .  yes .  i will .      i do . 
i 'm just glad there are n't any hard feelings . 
oh . 
i 've already thought about how to tell the kids where i was . 
or of course you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year . 
you 're fucked sami .  you know it .    that 's why you 're here . 
i 'm going to retire with a shitload of money .  find me a small country that does n't have an extradition treaty with the states and live the good life . 
yes i did .     lose ends are messy . 
i thought you wanted zammito ? 
where did they go ? 
it 's elvis .  .  . 
good .    i have a job for you in america . 
this is a considerable move up for you daniel .  the temptation of having so much money might be too much for you . 
i do n't have it .  that 's why vincent went to chicago .  they arrested him before he could bring it back . 
well you better get the money somehow .  six o 'clock and come alone .  if you do n't we 'll destroy the tapes . 
when you return please extend my regards to mr .  maranzano and his family . 
you sure ?  i just got a shipment of espresso from sicily .  special blend .  ca n't find anything like it in the states . 
i 'm good .    really . 
you told me that on the phone .  what the hell are you doing here ?  showing off your communication skills ?  go back to your people and tell them when they 're serious to put a number on the table . 
no one ?  then why is zero here ? 
and the vodka . 
i 'm trying .     it does n't work . 
i ca n't believe you did n't check . 
i would have to say .  .  .  pretty fuckin' bad .  you gave us the wrong address sophie . 
he 's been shot a lot .     he 's used to it . 
can i trust you sami ? 
what do you want now ? 
do n't bullshit me . 
how much ? 
dead bodies .  the ones in the lincoln are your .  .  .  associates . 
i was told to take what we have and go . 
i see .    a master criminal . 
do n't tell me to be cool !  we were supposed to be in and out .  in and out !  in the last twenty four hours we 've managed to get the mafia .  .  .  the fbi .  .  .  the chicago police department and a group of latin gang members after us .  i have n't left out anyone have i ?   i do n't think so because we 've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city ! 
she took everything !     did n't even leave us cab fare . 
this is the only american car you 've ever driven . 
i 'm not going to leave you . 
pink panther black panther .  who gives a shit ?  and i do n't remember asking you a god damn thing you little turd . 
what the hell is he talking about ? 
i do n't know .      it 's gotta be millions . 
watch this . 
i 'm more of a whiskey drinker myself . 
glenmorangie . 
zero did not put it in his bag .     he put it in yours . 
he 's right .  the tapes give us leverage with bastaldi . 
thanks . 
it belongs to vincent bastaldi .  he left it last time he was here .  i 'm sure he would n't mind if you used it . 
so you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed ? 
did she break your heart ? 
something like that . 
i do n't remember .     i was drunk . 
sorry .    i did n't mean to pry . 
it 's okay .    it was a long time ago . 
it 's not your fault . 
stick around and find out . 
she does n't know .  she thinks i fell down the stairs . 
for me ?  what am i going to do with a piece of shit like this ? 
much better .   you 've been gone so long . 
pardon me but i doubt you can handle her .   my wife was quite a martial arts expert .   jade fox killed her .   so you see this is personal .   leave her to me . 
why should i ?   you need practice .  i can teach you to fight with the green destiny but first you must learn to hold it in stillness . 
why do you want to teach me ? 
i 've always wanted a disciple worthy of wudan's secrets . 
tell me who is your master ? 
let 's go ! 
wherever we want .   we 'll get rid of anyone in our way .   even your father . 
i studied the diagrams .   but you hid the details ! 
master .  .  .  i started learning from you in secret when i was 10 .   you enchanted me with the world of giang hu .   but once i realized i could surpass you i became so frightened !   everything fell apart .  i had no one to guide me no one to learn from . 
believe me i 've a lesson or two left to teach you ! 
put them down . 
autumn is coming .   i 'll shut the windows for you . 
the handle is heavy .   and the blade is no ordinary metal .   still the sword is the lightest of weapons .  you 're just not used to handling it . 
my friend li mu bai .   he 's given it to sir te as a gift . 
i am not an aristocrat as you are .  .  .  but i must still respect a woman's duties . 
i 'm just borrowing some clean clothes .   i 'm not staying . 
look at the trouble you 've caused .  now you know what giang hu life is really like .   if you think of me as your sister let me give you some sisterly advice .   you can run from marriage but not your parents . 
come and get it if you can . 
spare your energy .   i 'll be back ! 
all right .   if you can take back the sword in three moves i 'll go with you . 
never ! 
all right .   hurry .   i will hold on as long as i can . 
jen ! 
not true .   i can use it to pick fleas from my horse . 
and so the little boy became a fearsome bandit .   he could n't find the stars so he stole my comb . 
so you 're still that little boy looking for shooting stars . 
father !   let me avenge my mother 's death . 
sir te !   it has brought him as much trouble as glory .   help him to leave these troubles behind .  otherwise he 'll never be able to start anew . 
yes though i doubt he 's involved in this . 
sir te can you find some excuse to invite madam yu and her daughter ? 
thanks babe . 
it 's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds . 
he was a present .   besides we 're moving anyway .   you said . 
fun  look at that guy .  .  . 
it 's just the dope do n't worry
who ? 
hey i got my rocks off so fuck you in the ass man . 
i can see her . 
i was n't knocking anything .  it 's just my belief that people should n't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions . 
look i 've got a lot of problems and i 'm trying to deal with them and the last thing i need is people spreading shit about me . 
look i 'm flattered but seriously it could never work . 
give it up . 
i wish i could say the same for myself .  i was up thinking about you all night . 
i 'm trying to better myself but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away . 
that 's none of your business . 
somerset maugham . 
i ca n't win with you . 
not at all .  have a seat . 
yes . 
where are you going ? 
hi . 
my mother and i used to ride a lot before she got sick . 
 none taken 
he 's from kansas city .  i would n't be surprised if he was your rat . 
not anymore .  football team started practice last week .  he 's already called me to hook up . 
hmmm .  i do believe bravo is showing spartacus on television tonight . 
no problem .  just make sure your front door is unlocked .  shall we say the stroke of midnight no pun intended ? 
he 's alright .   he kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over fourth of july . 
really ?  bulimic headcase . 
have n't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends ? 
it 's not gross .  how else do you think girls learn ?  here turn around and face me . 
do you want to learn or not ? 
okay . 
oh come on cecile .  he 's crazy about you . 
cecile if there 's one thing i 'm great at it 's love letters .  with my help he 'll be eating out of the palm of your hand .  perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house . 
i .  .  .  i do n't think you want to know . 
if she knew she 'd kill me .  it happened at your house last night . 
he made you give him a blow job . 
i am ? 
but i thought high school is only four years . 
is it me ? 
need any company ? 
i 'd be careful if i were you .  god knows what he 's up to . 
he does n't scare me .  i 'll kick his ass in . 
outstanding . 
in any event my feelings were hurt when i learned that he had fallen for someone else .  someone chaste .  .  .  pure .  .  .  innocent . 
i see your point .  .  .  though why should i care ? 
you do n't stand a chance .  even this is out of your league . 
because i 'm the only person you ca n't control and it kills you . 
even there ? 
i 'm working on it . 
jesus she reeks of laura ashley .   oh she 's crying .  wittle baby 's upset by the big bad book . 
so ?  how 'd it go last night ? 
where is she ? 
wow .  so you made love .  ooo i hear the birds chirping . 
excuse me ? 
not anymore you do n't .  it 's obvious . 
not my choice of toast but it 's your call .  to your triumph over annette . 
come again ? 
get out ?  we had an arrangement . 
i 'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed . 
then i will consider it a declaration of war .  one .  two .  .  .  three . 
i guess that puts me in my place .  thank you for the hospitality mrs .  caldwell .  it was a true awakening . 
i 've already told you she 's not home . 
yes you already did . 
i did ? 
oh .  .  .  no thank you .  .  . 
did she show up ? 
do you mind if i check upstairs ? 
you bastard ! 
i 'd love to . 
yes .  as a matter of fact i was on the point of telling you about it yesterday  about oliver 's first marriage  and his wife 's death .  it has so much to do with amy  although he 'll never realize it . 
yes  she 's a little odd i understand . 
no she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday . 
that 's the farren house . 
but i told her to go with you . 
she said something about that mrs .  reed  but she did n't tell me it was the farren house .  i 'll get my other hat and coat and go over there . 
but amy that was just a story it was n't real .   that tree 's no mailbox . 
ca n't you tell me later ? 
and this one 's for mrs .  farren . 
why daddy you know my friend too ! 
we open ours on christmas eve .  that 's considered proper . 
you called me by my name . 
i can not tell you . 
i shall want you for always . 
whenever you want . 
of course .  and two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee . 
oh but the winter 's fun .  there 's the wind and the snow .  you 'll like the warm fire upon the hearth and the long long nights . 
oh thank you amy . 
because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind . 
amy listen to me .  death is n't such a terrible thing . 
but amy !   amy .  .  . i 'm dead . 
a lady threw it to me . 
but i saw what it was .  it 's the little deer . 
one little piece of cake wo n't hurt you .  go ahead take one .  it 's full of fruit .  .  . citron cherries and ginger .  it 'll make you dream .  yes wonderful dreams . 
it was shot off long ago in the great battles that were fought here with the british on one side and the americans on the other . 
look at me . 
the storms have done everything they can to me i do n't hate them .  i do n't even hear the wind .  it blows beyond me .  it was on such a night as this that barbara died . 
gray .  they were a lovely lovely gray . 
it was pale .  .  . a shadowed gold . 
yes .  yes barbara i sha n't forget . 
little miss you ca n't stay here .  you 've got to come with me . 
i 've been working out . 
how have you been feeling ? 
he 's a very talented musician . 
so do n't look in his eyes . 
people notice you frida . 
what a bitch .  you should see a doctor .  that can be dangerous .  george bit me once and i had to go to the emergency room . 
i never thought of it like that .  i never know what to do on dates .  do guys still pay ? 
you are not frida we all have a little hair there .  i did n't even notice till you showed me .  we can bleach that it 's no big deal . 
i think i went in and fell asleep .  i guess gregory walked home and got killed !  i blacked out . 
my vision got worse again . 
he was n't wearing a ring .  but you do n't want to date a cop frida .  they 're so blue collar . 
i looked like an italian man ! 
you 're just saying that . 
i think he called you beautiful . 
it is so hot in here . 
i look like fuckin' chewbacca . 
you fucked carlton ?  see i told you he liked you . 
frida you 're not making sense .  i ca n't come over right now . 
relax .  carlton was torn apart .  no way could you have done that .  maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out .  .  .  or .  .  . 
the femalecycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves .  see i knew you never loved mark . 
fall in love . 
you scared the shit out of me .  i thought you were killing yourself . 
did i kill a guy named benito ? 
i wish i only had your problems . 
never been better .  peter spent the night .  i must really love him .  he 's still alive . 
i do development for tv movies . 
oh a dgirl .  you know .  .  .  i have a really great idea for a screenplay . 
come on did n't all that steak make you thirsty ? 
they say sex is great for cramps . 
oh come on .  knock it off . 
yes i do have to pee ! 
me neither .  that 's why i wear briefs .  .  .  so why did you and .  .  .  mark break up ? 
yeah .  maybe . 
silver bullets .  a collectors item .  these are very valuable .  they were melted down from a crucifix . 
a man killed in central park . 
no i got it .  it 's okay . 
i thought we were starting something .  .  .  and then .  .  .  i know it 's unorthodox i mean with you being involved in the case and all . 
what 's that supposed to mean ? 
did i tell you i have the worst sense of humor and i make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times ? 
this is a lot worse than betty . 
no it 's a good thing .  i like it .  everything about you is great .  i like how you do n't shave your legs .  women are so much sexier when they 're natural . 
no .  it does n't work that way .  men ca n't get pms .  unfortunately . 
we can work this out .  other couples have worse problems . 
you say you killed a man and do n't remember it .  could n't you have had sex and not remember it ?  it 's sexual .  why did you choose eating him as the method of killing ? 
you use the word fucking .  you 're sexualizing things .  stop berating yourself .  it 's okay to have sex . 
yes jennifer told me .  what does that have to do with me ? 
packages of money . 
two bags for them and one bag for your head in case her two fall off . 
she 's just insecure .  once you get to know her she 's fabulous . 
tell her i 'm eating . 
take some allergy medicine . 
you ca n't believe this bullshit . 
yeah sorry .  uh .  .  .  gregory 's roommate told us you were out with him last night . 
that dude was torn limb from limb .  no way a woman like that could have done it .  you never seen blood on a chick 's sheets from her period ? 
waiting for dna tests .  he was hairier than madonna in penthouse . 
we only live a few blocks apart . 
you take the cake lloyd .  come on she 's not here .  let 's check out her psycho ex . 
poseur was missing a chunk of his neck .  and his eyes were open .  that always bugs me out .  do me a favor if some mutherfucker 's about to blow me away remind me to close my fuckin' eyes . 
she was n't the last one to see them alive .  whoever killed them was . 
it has to be frida .  this makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass . 
what the fuck are you following me for ?  i 'm not a suspect here . 
nope .   no maps .   ocean huh ?   on vacation ? 
no one available . 
the chiefinspector thought you might need a hand . 
wo n't say .   says he must talk to you . 
yes sir .   ueverythingu ? 
i do n't know who they are . 
why are they after you ? 
do n't know much do you ? 
i 'm on the serial killer case need to talk . 
what is that door ? 
yes . 
but i .  .  . 
shut up ! 
that 's what people keep telling me . 
you 're supposed to be my doctor right ? 
i 'm nothing then . 
you ca n't go yet .   we 've got so much to talk about .  .  . 
so you 're telling me the truth uthisu time ?   is that it ! 
it 's the truth .  .  .   i need you .   i know you 're innocent . 
they 're dead john . 
right . 
i promise .   i wo n't . 
it 's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung .  .  .   hands to the side .  .  . 
now when she comes in we 'll move you right out to the balcony .   all you have to say is  thanks for doing this ellen . '
well maybe i am .   but you 're fired . 
i do n't give a shit . 
why would they do that .   they hired me . 
i just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be . 
choices ? 
well it 's .  .  .   it 's sort of an .  .  .  an incident'  really .  .  . 
in the car . 
i do n't think so . 
at a press conference . 
what ? 
yes it 's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase . 
why ? 
well i 'm sure that 's really important but i do n't want to tell some eight yearold kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars .   do you want to tell him that ? 
certainly . 
the fidelity nonsense .  .  . 
you know .   your first campaign . 
that 's not just a works bill you vetoed  that would have given these kids homes .  .  .    .  .  .  when i think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick .  .  . 
you made their funding disappear ! 
there 's no mistake bill .    if you veto their funding it 's not a mistake .  if you hurt someone intentionally it 's not a mistake . 
mind if i sit down ? 
i never wanted to hurt anybody .   in fact .  .  .  i even thought i was helping . 
truman used it all the time . 
i 'm starving .    there 's got to be something open around here . 
two of us .  .  . only two of us .  .  . me .  .  . and him .  
where are your headquarters rebel ?  tell me or i 'll let you hang there forever .  .  . forever ! 
then why did you come here ? 
how did you know we were on this island ?  do others know ?  will others come ? 
gasparilla ? 
i 'm sure that 's true miss .  and that 's why we 're doin' what we 're doin' .  what 's happenin' underground here is just what lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man .  but we 're gonna beat lucifer .  we 're gonna put an end to what 's happenin' here . 
farther than you think .  you 'll get lost .  you will .  and there 's bees all through the jungle .  i ai n't lyin' to ya .  religiosos do n't lie . 
you disappear in here darlin' .  you get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins .  you get lost out here and nobody 's gonna notice .  rhodes he counts on that .  it all makes for food in the freezers . 
forever darlin' .  forever .  til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind . 
what ? 
they are brutes without feeling .  though i admit that i 've requested cremation for myself .  burial is an archaic tradition even more ridiculous now than it ever was .  to say nothing of the .  .  . spacing problem .  .  . on a small island like this . 
the purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much .  .  . food .  .  . as possible .  the purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side .  the fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit not the primary goal .  the primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper .  keep them fed and they behave .  keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been .  you saw them in there . 
one day a dead man will refuse to return and that man will be a saint .  the first saint of our century .  that 's a prayer too .  a catechism .  something the priests tell us to believe . 
and you 're the one who builds the bomb and they says i hope it 'll never actually be used' . 
no miss science .  you 're the one who needs to do some thinking . 
mary ! 
sir ! 
actually i do n't really know mutt . 
so do n't goddam come !   please . 
all i 'm saying is we have to be careful .  we ca n't get caught . 
hell no i 'm not afraid of them just if we get caught with them we 're dead . 
knox overstreet . 
yeah !   tell him off !   it could n't get any worse . 
how about a trig study group ?   right after dinner .

my daughter she 's bought a big house with a room for me .   i 'm going to move in with her .

ask me in about five minutes . 
she 's locked safe in her room no thanks to either of you .   has he brought it back on course yet ? 
he 's the son of the captain for chrissakes .  you 'd think he 'd be able to operate this thing ! 
i 'm not staying in my room uncle charles . 
you let me worry about him okay ?   personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers rennie .  you made the right decision . 
about four years ago .  .  . at crystal lake .  i spent a few summers there with uncle charles inbetween boarding school . 
after your parents passed away ? 
what is your location ? 
if i go with you he 'll never speak to me again .   but i 'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway .  .  . so maybe it 's the right thing to do . 
please hurry .  .  . 
what do you mean we must abandon ? 
do not inhale . 
i drove twelve hours straight through .  ate at the wheel . 
shut up elliot . 
she wants a divorce . 
what about the haircut ? 
the most interesting thing about elliot litvak is that he writes the way he looks  fuzzy grubby and shiftyeyed .  i 'm telling you as a friend . 
how do you eknow . 
classic . 
yes .  what are you implying ? 
peter redmond .  they found out why he ca n't remember his lines .  there 's something living in his brain .  a parasite he picked up in borneo doing the movie . 
that 's not all nicky .  i 've been backing your plays for fifteen years .  and i 've never been more depressed . 
what else ? 
we stranded five runners in the first two innings .  this will come back to haunt us . 
how prominent ? 
i 'm glad we 're having this talk . 
i do n't know if i can say that . 
i 'm on my way to get a haircut . 
but the son is suppose to stop crying . 
i know pop . 
i think the building 's okay .  at least for the time being . 
matthew look at him .  when i lived in roxbury the media followed this man everywhere .  he was bigger than ten movie stars .   where 's your white lincoln limo ? 
this is one charming crook .  if shooting people is charming . 
what am i doing ? 
frankie lazzaro .  coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media .  children see this .  they think you 're the secretary of the treasury . 
you 're afraid to risk believing .  believe in them .  believe in your self .  take a risk .  it will humanize you as a person . 
speak it like it 's real .  matthew . 
they 're my team . 
i went to college in boston so i could be near the red sox .  i took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game .  my wife is from boston .  lillian ziegler ? 
appreciate that sidney .  but our leading man ca n't remember his lines .  and his understudy ca n't carry the play . 
so what happened since ?  you 're worried about this kid who writes these reviews ? 
because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business . 
i kissed shirley felder on the teeth . 
but my parasite is consuming all the new memories .  eating my lines . 
we have a very nice pasta today .  alla putanesca . 
engaging . 
would you like to meet him ? 
is it true ? 
is what true ? 
home . 
never mind . 
he goes to the theater armed . 
not if you stopped hurting people .  write the truth gently . 
i do n't want you steven . 
yes  i ca n't talk like this . 
mr .  khan said they called you brave . 
it is the work of untouchables . 
in this place there are no untouchables  and no work is beneath any of us ! 
there 's no room !  and the air is lovely . 
i will follow close behind you and help to serve the people . 
not without defeats  and great pain .   but are there no defeats in this war  no pain ?   what you cannot do is accept injustice .  from hitler  or anyone .  you must make the injustice visible  be prepared to die like a soldier to do so . 
what do you expect when you talk like that ? 
i expect you to show as much patience as i am now . 
i 'm simply going to prove to muslims there and hindus here that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts  and that 's where all our battles ought to be fought . 
we must end the campaign . 
you will respect the law . 
that 's right .  the word only means community .  but it could stand for village .  .  .  or the world . 
even as a boy i thought so . 
a great deal . 
it would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing . 
good .   ba will have to teach you to spin too . 
first spin .  let the others march for a time . 
i 'll send my gardener .  i 'm sure you 'll have much to discuss . 
that 's when you take advantage . 
thank you .  no . 
somehow i expected not . 
he 's discovering india . 
 .  .  . an eye for an eye making the whole world blind . 
it 's for the best . 
i like football . 
it would be five thousand more . 
i 'll see what i can do . 
we 're already getting complaints about frivolous search . 
from what budget ? 
i 'll take it out of your damn ipensioni if you question my authority one more time ! 
i 'm proud of you vincent . 
they 'll recognize me . 
is that all ? 
if you say so .   the stripe . 
i do n't feel too good .   i think i 'm still drunk from last night . 
you 're not thinking of telling her are you ? 
of course not .   but she 's have to know eventually . 
how the hell did you get here . 
no but you might need them when you get back . 
where are you going ? 
german is that you ? 
why are you inventing problems ?   you two are a couple of goddam clones .   you look so right together i want to double my fee . 
a fingerprint .   there 's something to be said for nostalgia .   what did you find ? 
no it ca n't be verified .   yes i was alone . 
why would we do that ? 
i have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot .  do n't you ? 
i do n't think so .   the only trip i 'll make in space is around the sun  on this satellite right here . 
nothing yet .   i 'll start experiencing symptoms in my latefifties .   but unless they come up with something between now and then i wo n't live much past 67 . 
let 's walk . 
that 's precisely what iscaresimethat they wo n't do anything ifoolishi or icourageousi or ianythingiworth a goddamn . 
unfortunately my son's not all that they promised .   but then who know what he could do . 
you know you and i may be two of a kind . 
what do you add up to here ? 
it looks fine . 
you know i 've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes .  .  .  worn out waiting . 
i mean it . 
we 're going to have a lot of those  we 're just going to get the money and then go all the way .

this man informs to the police this man allows his vengeance to be bought off .  .  .  no he is alone . 
let 's go . 
c 'mon i see what i can do . 
tonight i want to relax with you .  the senator from nevada is here with some people from washington .  i want to show them a good time in havana . 
me and you great !   gimme an hour to wash my face and do my research and we 'll have these washington suckers right where you want em .   poor frankie fiveangels .   he always wanted to die in bed .  .  . with a broad . 
you ?   what do you mean you i thought .  .  . 
it was frankie tried to have me hit . 
mike are you crazy i 'm your brother . 
we have time . 
it 's the way pop wanted it . 
it was n't the way i wanted it !   i can handle things .   i 'm not dumb christ not like everyone says .  i 'm smart and i want respect . 
why ? 
he took the money .   now he wants double from everybody in the neighborhood including papa . 
what kind of a family is this .  .  .  are we human beings ?   he knows his father killed his uncle carlo .   he heard connie . 
i can feel it in the way he talks to me . 
it 's as though he blames me for the ground the family lost when i was consigliere to sonny . 
why did n't someone tell me ! 
sure mikey . 
but your people .  .  .  neri .  .  .  rocco you do n't think .  .  . 
no tom just listen .   all my people are businessmen their loyalty is based on that .   one thing i learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think .  .  . and on that basis anything is possible .  fredo has a good heart but he is weak .  .  . and stupid and stupid people are the most dangerous of all .   i 've kept you out of things tom because i 've always known that your instincts were legitimate and i wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice for your own protection .  i never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under sonny i know you were in a position of limited power and you did your best to advise and caution him .   what i am saying is that now for how long i do not know you will be the don .  if what i think has happened is true i will leave tonight and absolutely no one will know how to contact me .   and even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary .   i give you complete power over neri .  .  .  fredo everyone .   i am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children and the future of this family solely resting on your judgment and talent . 
the new government arrested him held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people including roth 's brother sam .   the american embassy arranged flights for citizens i 'm not sure but i think he 's somewhere in new york . 
mike it would be like trying to kill the president there 's no way we can get to him . 
i 'm surprised at you tom .   if there 's anything certain certain in life if history has taught us anything it 's that you can kill .  .  .   anybody .   but perhaps your relucatance is because you 've come to tell me that you 're moving your family to vegas that you 've been offered the vicepresidency of the houstan hotels there .   or were n't you going to tell me at all ? 
i turned houstan down i did n't see why i should tell you about an offer i turned down .   are you sure mikey ?   are you sure of what we 're doing what we 'll gain what does the family gain ?  forget that mike i already know the answer . 
he 's going to try panama .  .  . 
i 'd like to go outside with him in the open air . 
he 's ten times tougher than me my brother .   he 's oldfashioned . 
yeah it was once . 
do you gamble ? 
simple .   be friendly like us .   not hostile . 
i do n't think that 's necessary . 
yes sir .   his name is vincenzo pentangeli . 
this meeting is adjourned . 
whose orders are these ? 
mr .  ola 's just leaving kay .  please tell the senator i wo n't be a minute . 
i wanted to see you before you went back to nevada .   also the children  michael they 're here . 
in a minute .   they 're outside with esther .   i 'm very happy for you .  .  .  i suppose i knew that you 're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you . 
there are a lot of things i want to talk to you about .   things i 've been thinking about  changes i want to make . 
that 's all .   you see in sicily in the old days .  .  .  there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative .  .  .  only one .   if he was a traitor . 
you would have killed his brother ? 
kay you 've got it wrong .   that kind of thing 's all over i promised you .   this was between the two brothers .   years ago frankie had a young girlfriend he called her his cowife .   that was his joke but he meant it .   he would n't divorce his wife .  .  .  because she was a great cook .   he said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her .   he set her up in a house in jersey .   she had to be faithful .  .  .  and she had to have kids .  and she did two a boy and a girl .  he had her checked out and watched so she could n't cheat .  .  .  but the girl could n't stand that kind of life .   she begged him to let her go .  he did .   he gave her money and made her give up the kids .   then frankie took them to italy and had them brought up by his brother vincenzo .  where he knew they 'd by safe . 
i represent the interests of the corleone family .   we make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by monday morning . 
alright .   they bother me once in awhile .   tell me when pop had troubles .  .  .  did he ever think even to himself that he had gone the wrong way that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family that he could .  .  .  that he could .  .  .  lose it instead ? 
you talk about the baby .   she can have another baby . 
but times are different .  .  . 
the money was sent . 
and ? 
we will release the hostages number one .   number two we 're here for you to count on when you need us .   we 're independent but we 're here if you need us .   in general we 'll cooperate with you and your businesses and you in turn will cooperate with us .   pari persu . 
go wash glasses if you do n't like it . 
funny is funny and scary is scary .  you do n't mix them . 
do you realize you 're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me ? 
sure you 're free for now at least .  but how long before you 're just alone ?   pathetic and alone . 
i 'm keeping away .   what you are doing is no business of mine . 
why ? 
you 're sure of that ? 
good .   that is what i hope .   i did not think you a bugger too .   i fear only that you might hurt him if he tries . 
i 'm not going to hurt anyone . 
it is my job .   i did it when he was happy and it was easy .   it is only fair i do it now when he is ill .   enough talk .   i must wake up the master . 
oh mr .  jimmy . 
he says here goodbye .   i find it in his room .   he is sorry he says .  he has had a wonderful life . 
do you want to be questioned about you and mr .  jimmy ?   please clayton .   it will be better if i find the body alone . 
and your name is  ? 
i 'm just a hick who cuts lawns .  but some of these look familiar . 
they 're just copies then .   gotcha . 
i returned recently from a stay in hospital . 
football in college . 
you mean  you really want to draw me ? 
i 'm sorry .   it 's too white too distracting .   would it be asking too much for you to take it off ? 
i guess you 'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks . 
yes .   an old useless friend .   you must excuse me mr .  boone .   this is a world i finished with long ago .  i pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment .   lunch should be ready .   shall we ? 
no . 
of course .   i had to make it interesting for myself you see .   a comedy about death .   the trick is not to ruin it for anyone who is n't in on the joke .   but the monster never receives any of my gibes .   he is noble .   noble and misunderstood . 
sorry .   i do n't feel like sitting still today . 
you ever been married mr .  whale ? 
it will only make you selfconscious .   you 'll have to remove your shirt . 
ah .   a philosopher . 
from now on mr .  whale i cut your grass and that 's it .   understand ? 
i thought you 'd given up on my picture . 
why not ?   give us something to do while we wait . 
them 's the breaks right ?   no war stories for this pup . 
james whale .   this afternoon at the party . 
i do n't recall .   memories of the war perhaps . 
you 're planning a trip ? 
your friend ?

hasta la vista boone .   and give the jail bait a squeeze for me . 
i think i 'll hang around . 
i was until last night .   publicity asked me to fly miss taylor in for today 's reception . 
only a mad scientist could do this to a woman . 
bring a mirror .   let the bride feast upon her visage . 
oh nothing out of the ordinary .  growing old . 
i 'm fine jimmy .   i can only stay a few minutes . 
of course . 
just go .   we can manage without you . 
six years .  shit .  time flies do n't it ?  six years ago we were fartin' through armani and pissin' cristal .  now look at us  .  .  . 
the business has changed .  .  . 
you have a hollandaise sauce  ? 
they gave me two weeks .  i wasted most of it with your brother and his crew who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor making this even more difficult to achieve  .  .  . 
look at it .  i ca n't very well make delivery of that thing  .  .  . 
you got no choice .  it 's over . 
a little family emergency 
kip . 
something like that 
what do you want from me ? 
doublemeaning intended 
the other day .  .  .  . 
not at all  .  .  . 
hey donny 
you know where the others are ? 
oh .  you maybe have more than one enemy who owns a carcrusher   ?

i can handle it 
come here 
i know  .  .  . 
toby .  .  .

thought i 'd go for a ride 
yeah .  he 's knows of one all right . 
for real ? 
call em here   ? 
the hip cool sexy thing was getting old .  .  . 
kip took a job .  fifty ladies in two weeks .  only the two weeks have turned into four days .  and not a single lady has been snared . 
cos there were those dark days when i figured  my god how easy it was for him to just give it up to make the deal take the rot for the whole crew  .  .  .  and give me up in the process . 
no  .  .  .   ? 
i think so .  .  .  they 're just .  .  .  so  .  .  . 
cut em .  .  . 
with a twist of my wrist  .  .  .  you 're turned over  .  .  . 
wrong preposition .  .  . 
no worries  .  .  . 
they got him to the hospital .  he 's stable  .  .  . 
yeah  .  .  .  you   ? 
what 's that ? 
are you considering a comeback tour ? 
the old crew .  go find them .  i ca n't help you with that .  since i 've cleaned up the act a bit they no longer come around .  .  .  a pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular 
the guy from near where christie used to live ? 
nods again . 
but paulie i 'm sorry .  believe me .   i was fucking crazy .   but i 'm okay now .  i can be trusted .   i 'm clean now .  on my children .  believe me !  two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together .  .  . 
you thought i was some fucking jerk ? 
i 'm in construction . 
are you nuts ?   jeannie 's husband went to the can just to get away from her she 's such a pain in the ass .  let me tell you .  nobody goes to jail unless they want to unless they make themselves get caught .  they do stuff with the wrong people .  they do n't have things organized .  you know who goes to jail ?  nigger stickup men .  that 's who .  and they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car . 
even paulie since he got out i hardly see him . 
do n't worry about it .  you listening to me ?  now come on .  we gotta go see paulie . 
hello !   hello !   have a good flight ? 
they had a warrant .  they went through everything .  they would have found it .  i swear . 
it 's been six months . 
there are cops all over the place . 
so what ?   where are they gonna go ? 
who else ?  paulie got the okay .  this little guinea fuck .  someday he 's gonna be a boss .  can you believe someday we 'll work for him . 
jimmy and i could never be made because we bad irish blood .  it did n't even matter that my mother was sicilian .  to become a member of a crew you 've got to be one hundred percent italian so that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country . 
right away i knew he did n't want them .  i knew i was going to get stuck for the money .  i only bought the damn guns because he wanted them .  and now he did n't want them .  i did n't say a thing .  jimmy was so pissed he did n't even say goodbye . 
and jimmy 's in it right ? 
whadda you mean you ca n't make any more deliveries ?  you 're going to fuck up everything ? 
you 're some fucking jerk . 
i do n't give a shit .  that guy 's got no right . 
tommy   .  .  . 
it 's okay .  i 'll make it up .   i promise .  just hurry it up a little .  okay ?

jimmy .   i do n't know .   i got so much else on my mind .   i got the kids .   we got no money . 
he says he 's too hot .   he does n't even know i came here today .   it 's like he 's crazy .  jimmy .

in that case fine .   want to see my magic trick ? 
sure . 
well there 's this part of the movie that 's about how there 's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what 's going to happen with the whole good night kiss' thing . 
you know what i mean .  i know you 've at least thought about it . 
yes you have .  you were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss . 
well .  .  .

this ? 
would you describe their position as inflexible ? 
intractable sir .  you leave tonight . 
there 's nothing to be done about it .

i can handle it ! 
is this how you 're going to make me pay my phone bill ? 
feel good ? 
yeah i think it is .  and i do n't mean everybody 's got to be married have kids  it 's more like knowing where you 're from where you belong what feeds you where you can go no matter what happens .  .  .  knowing what you 're supposed to be doing while you 're here . 
why ? 
i ca n't even get out of bed yet !  you 're already putting me in therapy !  !

oh robert i 'm sorry .  we were so tired from the branding .  grace barely made it to her bed and i did n't have the energy to take my clothes off . 
no it 's okay .  believe me there were plenty of times i did n't know what the hell was right .

delayed shock .  or maybe not .  i know i could talk my way back if i wanted or .  .  .  go to another magazine someplace .  .  .  just not sure if i want to . 
they do n't come better .  but i do n't deny there are times i wonder about things i wo n't have .  maybe one day i 'll get to see egypt .  maybe not .  but i know if you try too many different lives you can wind up with no life at all .  .  .

twentyfive grand is peanuts !   all you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect .

'many years uh .  .  .  i know that you will be wondering why i have decided to move on ending my tenure at hudsucker and here on earth .  you will be thinking why now when things are going so well ?  granted from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials sure sure we 're doing fine .  however sid .  these things have long since ceased to give me pleasure .  i look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company .  now i see only an empty shell whom others call a success . how has this come to pass ?  when and why did i trade all of my hopes dreams and aspirations for the emptiness of power and wealth ?  what the heck have i done ? 
good afternoon to ya this is norville barnes 
sidney and i are planning a trip to paris and points continental  are n't we dear ? 
you have a charming wife mr .  muss  uh sid . 
well i 'm a college graduate 
thank you sid but the reason i mention it is it would require such a small capital investment  again you 're the expert here 
it 's not important in itself  some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you 'd stolen the idea for the uh the hoop dingus from him 
twenty bucks says not here she do n't find one . 
she looks in her purse .  .  . 
maybe he 's wise . 
 .  .  . her mother needs an operation .  .  . 
thank you . 
i would have stayed anyway dr .  maxwell . 
yes the redoubtable paul .   he has the plantation and i as you must have noticed have all the charm . 
what in the world are you talking about ?   six ounces   ? 
please wes do as i ask .   you must rest you must sleep . 
yes he can .   but i 've been wondering  you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table 
still i feel you should remove the decanter .   wes is not an alcoholic yet mr .  holland .  but as a nurse i can tell you that it wo n't be long before he is . 
i 'm afraid the decanter will have to stay where it is .   i engaged you miss connell to take care of my wife not my brother . 
i took mrs .  holland to the houmfort .   i thought they might cure her . 
i have no defense .   so far as i know  it is true . 
do n't paul  do n't doubt yourself  do n't make me doubt you . 
insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure mr .  holland .  but  as miss connell pointed out when she suggested it  this is an extreme case . 
maybe it 's better this way mother .  i 'm glad you 're going home betsy  you 'll be out of the mess . 
are you going to lie for him mother ? 
got a meeting uptown . 
right o' . 
yeah good . 
it 's you ben who needs to talk .  i 've had my say and i 'm waiting to hear back from you . 
yeah but elena even you do n't believe all that i 'm ok .  you 're ok stuff you keep babbling about  you say so yourself .  i 've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject and 
what else could i be ?  what else could i be ?  we 're not living in the real world here .  you 're living out some fantasy land from the past or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts .  .  .  there are some hard facts here . 
listen benjamin hood .  i have obligations that precede your .  .  .  from before you showed up .  one or two you know goodnatured encounters that does n't mean i 'm .  .  .  i 'm not just some toy for you .  when i remembered some chores i wanted to get done before the party i just did them that 's all because i wanted to do them before i saw jimmy . 
how you take it is n't all that interesting to me benjamin .  i 'm sorry 
what you been up to ? 
but i  well maybe i love her .  elena . 
what the hey .  let 's go for a drive . 
i suppose .  why ? 
it 's not a bother . 
educated guess . 
i 'm that predictable ?  no you do n't have to answer that .  it 's just that with the kids almost grown 
all well and good  but tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in ? 
selfrealization .  ministering to help people reach their fullest potential .  would you believe me if i told you i want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and selfrealization ? 
sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep . 
what ? 
what do you mean ? 
francis .  you gonna leave the seeds in there ?  in the binding like that ? 
let 's see ! 
tonight ?  jim he 's been out of it since he was born . 
you think francis is going to beat me to the punch here ? 
no one . 
yeah ? 
i 'm chewing . 
what 's the d . a .  got them on ? 
it 's all about the small stuff .   small lies .   small mistakes .   small oversights .  people give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case .   it 's human nature . 
but there was n't any .  .  . 
good .   he 's up next . 
twelve years younger . 
that must have been awful for you . 
then change it . 
worth pursuing ? 
we just gotta catch the bastard right ? 
anything .   it 's important . 
yes .   not that much at first .   but then she became more comfortable .   started visiting me every week .  .  . 
she 'd come to me sometimes in the middle of the night .   bruises all over her back her upper arms .   i pled with her to let me call the police but she would n't hear it .   wanted to keep it a secret . 
seven years . 
i . a . s calling themselves the corruption task force .   can you believe that ?  trying to root out any mistakes or oversights any other detectives may have made over the years .   they 're turning it into a witch hunt .   something on the news about it practically every night . 
when's that a week ?   two weeks ?  .  .  .   we have to figure out a plan of action now . 
what are we thinking ? 
you do n't have to be involved will . 
that 's not what he thinks . 
what did he look like ? 
there 've been other cases .   where we 've changed results .   pushed witnesses .  manipulated evidence .   but dobbs .   i wanted dobbs more than anything . 
kay connell .   did you love her ? 
ran like hell to go to him .  .  . 
you do n't know . 
that 's a long time . 
we were like sisters .   knew everything about each other . 
i suppose . 
we want no quarrel with him . 
we can do that ? 
follow me  that way  through my cell 
is this my birthday ? 
be glad i made you what you are !  you 'd be dead not if i had n't . 
what plans ? 
then i hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess . 
they are ducklings that will grow into swans .  whereas i must be the duckling forever . 
you are neither claudia .  now stop this 
i can feel it from them !  they want to know who made us what became of him .  they have their rules their idiotic rules ! 
never . 
you really believe that ? 
do n't make me claudia !  i cannot do it ! 
then my luck would have changed . 
yes .  .  . 
no !  !  !  !  ! 
give it to me !  !  ! 
call him . 
your perfect .  your bitter and you 're strong . 
you asked for death .  i did n't promise it 
no .  .  . 
are you mad ?  ?  ?  ? 
you 've come back to me louis ?  you 've come again to me ? 
you remember how i was louis .  .  the vampire lestat .  .  . 
perhaps lucky for both of us . 
why should i lie ?  1791 was the year it happened .  i was twentyfour  younger than you are now . 
what about coffins ? 
no vampires in transylvania ?  no count dracula ? 
he had n't even been there .  and all those years i thought he was dead . 
if i could see what you 've seen feel what you 've felt i would n't let it end like this !  you need a like to the world out there a connection .  .  .  then it wo n't end like this .  .  . 
a child who ca n't die .  .  . 
titus you 're so stoned you 'd end up in spain . 
uptighteous and selfrighteous . 
i think i just really hurt ray 's feelings . 
no means yes . 
i know it and it feels good .   hi ty . 
do n't even think about it . 
it 's not like that .  it 's not you .  it 's me .  my head .  i want to go back .  i want to be with you .  i want to be fine .  i want everything to be like it used to be .   it just is n't .

how clover you are mr .  albrecht to see all that in our simple thea .  .  .  she is quite pretty is n't she ? 
this is general nikolas pherides commander of the third army .  i 'm oliver davis .   to be perfectly frank with you we did n't expect to find anyone living here . 
did your servant got word to dr .  drossos ?

sharp shiny teeth  and they creep up to your bed 
some village in the mountains  alethera i think .

i mean does one love a father because he is good and kind or just because he is one 's father ? 
why i love my father because  because i do .  of course he 's nice to me . 
i do not know him but i have seen him .

her name is thea ? 
was she ill before that girl came into your household ? 
it does n't seem to bother you much general . 
i know all you are going to say i have been saying it to myself but the thought will not leave my mind .  she resembles my wife there is something about her the way she moves  the way she turns her head . 
listen to what i say 
not theodosia .  theodosia 's daughter  your daughter . 
everything 's so simple .  i like you . 
well tell him . 
i knew that feuds still went on but i did n't think people like you and the general would be involved .

the groom idiot .  come on get that ladder . 
all right  all right . 
oh i forgot .  you have n't got your wings yet .  now look i 'll help you out .  concentrate .  begin to see something ?

that 's right .  not only that but he gave his school money to his brother harry and sent him to college .  harry became a football star  made second team all american . 
yes but what happened to george ? 
what 's that book you 've got there ? 
now we come to the real purpose of this meeting  to appoint a successor to our dear friend peter bailey . 
it was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization . 
that 's the best part of it .  they 've appointed george here as executive secretary to take his father 's place . 
you can keep him on .  that 's all right .  as secretary you can hire anyone you like . 
george bailey .  yes tonight 's his crucial night .  you 're right we 'll have to send someone down immediately .  whose turn is it ?

they do n't have that kind of money mr .  potter .  you know that .  you 're the only one in town that can help me . 
you 've passed me on the street almost every day .

it means i do n't like all that grabass and heavy breathing with my wife it means i know who 's out to screw me here and it means that i know something none of you know because i 've been there  and i do n't want to go through that horror again .   ever ! 
come on let 's check the bite radius . 
bite radius .   you know the size of the mouth ? 
the whale 's mouth ? 
look i know a little bit about sharks . 
because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish .  .  .  . 
ca n't you tell ? 
good . 
because of today ?   the beach ? 
oh yeah .   so why are n't they doing it now ? 
maybe . 
nope .

they tend to follow moving things .  maybe it 's following polo and timmy .

they 'll be there when we get there .  might even have a fire started . 
i dunno .   we 'll think of something .

denver got very silent about a day ago .   san diego 's got a fever for cush .   this stuff tends to happen the night before a draft .   people get crazy .   and san diego you should know is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty .  signing bonus of eight .   million . 
i 'm sorry i 
okay . 
mmm .   hmm . 
i gotta get back to cushman . 
i 'm not about love  i 'm about showing you the money .

rod i 'm not a rascist .   i 'm telling you to be the best version of you to get back to the guy who first started playing this game .  way back when you were a kid .   it was n't just about the money was it ? 
i think you 'll know when you see him at the gate . 
she 's an nfl publicist .  .  .  amazing sense of style .  .  .  former athlete .  .  .  volleyball .  .  .  world class .  .  .  really knows how to live every moment of her life which is why i should take a nap now .  .  . 
i 'm over it .   now i want all my clients and yours too . 
 and i 'll get em . 
can you be quiet ? 
what is it ? 
from what i understand it 's pretty much whatever we want . 
we called everyone did everything we could .  because of all the controversy over this island no one will step in .  costa rica says it 's a nofly zone it 's their own damn fault .  guys at the u . s embassy  our u . s .  embassy  said we should accept the inevitable .  you believe that ? 
nothing . 
i filmed this the morning they left . 
you could n't have made that jump . 
on the island . 
back then they had n't tried to eat me . 
yeah . 
i dunno .  i mean it was kind of preachy .  chaosthis chaosthat .  and like to me the guy seemed kind of high on himself . 
why ? 
i guarantee it 'll be worth your while . 
now for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special something .  .  . 
let 's just say that through my business  importsexports emerging markets  i 've made some friends in high places .  in this case the costa rican government . 
dr .  grant we 're not leaving without our son . 
just a little bit too much i think . 
you broke that idiot 's jaw for no reason other than your boredom .   tell the truth roland .   are n't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry ? 
minimal . 
they do have motives .   why did you want to see me ?   your message said it was urgent . 
well ?   did n't it all seem a trifle compact to you ? 
i do n't believe you . 
very hurtful .   your mother tell you to say that ? 
which one ? 
to collect my fee . 
no . 
a statistical phenomenon .   says everything in the world goes in streaks .   it 's real you see it everywhere  in weather in river flooding in baseball in blackjack in stock markets .   once things go bad they tend to stay bad .   bad things cluster .   they go to hell together . 
feeling a bit blue are we ? 
why did you come here ? 
so that others would know about this place ? 
because it exists . 
john hammond . 
what ?  ! 
i believe in him . 
it 's not worth taking the chance john . 
i will not do it .   you 'll have to get somebody else because i will not . 
  shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did .  if i understand correctly all the system will come back on their original startup modes correct ? 
wait a minute .   what exactly does this mean ? 
yeah again in  theory but  
how would we cut off the lysine ? 
dodgson dodgson .   we got dodgson here !   see nobody cares .   nice hat .  what are you trying to look like a secret agent ? 
how am i supposed to transport them ? 
that 's up to your guy on the boat .   seven o 'clock tomorrow night at the east dock .  make sure he got it right . 
you wo n't be able to miss them .   ca n't miss them . 
  and swallows fresh ones . 
you ca n't just stroll down the road you know . 
i get ah  
it 's antinature . 
alan listen to this .

 .  .  . i want to .  .  .  . i want so many things claudia .  maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out .  .  .  . there are so many things that i want to tell you 
i 'm not crazy .   do n't you tell me i 'm crazy . 
i 'm coming ! 
ok .   claudia wilson you tryin' to go deaf ? 
well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you 're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears . 
and that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum you understand ? 
claudia why do n't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers ok ? 
i 'm a bit of a slob myself . 
yeah .  .  . it 's not .  .  . it 's been on for a bit 
that 'd be fine .   so claudia lemme just say so i can get my role of lapd officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  i 'm not gonna write you up or anything i 'm not gonna give you a citation here  but the real problem we have is that there are people around here people that work from their homes people tryin' to get some work done and if you 're listenin' to your music that loud  they 're incovenienced by that .   if you had a job you 'd probably understand but i see you like listenin' to your music and that 's fine you 're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that  if it 's the middle of the day  that 's what i do  just put it on two and a half and that 's a good listening level alright ?  i see you like listenin' to your music loud but hey forget about the neighbors you end up damaging your own ears ok ? 
i do n't have a boyfriend . 
what 's that stand for ? 
tempuralsomethingmandibular thing with something i dunno .  but it affects my ear i do n't even know if i have tmj exactly but just very tight like  it 's like a muscle spasm and it 's just gets so clenched

you need to sober up . 
now you must really shut the fuck up please .  shut the fuck up . 
yes . 
that is good . 
i ca n't bear to see you cry .   what is wrong ? 
then we will both die traitors d 'artagnan . 
may i speak with you ?   alone ? 
i am preparing for a ball ! 
i have demanded it  and common priests present themselves !   can you imagine the arrogance ?   common jesuit priests try to act as my equals and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order !   no one can keep secrets like the jesuits can and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold .   even the pope himself does not know who leads the jesuit order in france !   he suspects the governor general of jesuits whoever he is is angling to become pope himself . 
then you are a fool  a fool who has never lost a son .   what gives you the right to judge me to play god with the lives of others ?   is it because you are so much holier than everyone else ?  ! 
three days ?  ?  !  ! 
paris .   there is still much to do .  we 'll be back soon .   be ready . 
the secret i carry i cannot share .  not even with god . 
not just a baby porthos .   i carried the child of the king . 
so was mary magdalene and our lord loved her . 
then let him kill me if all my faith is wrong . 
he lures us to capture . 
it is something i have done  or did not do . 
is that the king of king you wish me to be ?   or do you say this because of your son ? 
how did you know   ? 
how did you 
then there is one more thing of an even more personal nature . 
your majesty has had many women 
it is not raoul 's heart alone that concerns me .   it is yours .   i know you find women compliant  especially the poorer ones like michelle .   but do they love you ?   do you love them ?   what about a queen to love ?   a son of your own ? 
order fromberge to keep him in safety !   it is the least you can do to protect your own honor ! 
it shall be done your majesty . 
yes your majesty . 
yes yes go on . 
athos the former musketeer has just fought with several of your guard at the musketeers' gate . 
sire i 
enough of this our dinner waits . 
wait no !   do not be ashamed .   the straits of your family need not be permanent .   it is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates where they may have fine meals and physicians to look after them . 
sire i 
yeah  i heard  nothing came up . 
so what ? 
right behind you . 
well you figured wrong !   and now i 'm public enemy number one .   you have an answer for that ? 
yeah .  .  . they did .   one girl .  .  . 
yeah .  .  . 
tubbs listen !   i do n't know anywhere else to go !   i need your help ! 
it 's .  .  . it 's a long story .   can we meet somewhere ? 
shit you know what happens to me if i 'm harboring a fugitive ?   i already think they 're on to me !  i thought you were the phone police for chrissake ! 
i have nowhere else to go tubbs i need your help ! 
i got a lot of free time you know what i mean ? 
both at the same bank .  .  . 
screw him ! 
oh yeah ?   you 're a smart man ?  .  .  . 
because i 'm professionally concerned about him .  and he 'd pick up on that .  he 's fast .  he hates being prodded and poked .   so do i .   what do you want ? 
i 'll tell you the events .  the psychology 's none of your business .  hobbs was trying to cut his eleven yearold daughter 's throat .  graham shot him with his  . 38 six times .  hobbs still did n't go down .  he had to wade in .  .  . 
that 's when it happened ? 
no .  it happened when graham went to see hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital .  she saved her carotid artery .  .  but lost three fingers and her larynx .  she was connected up to a voice box .   when graham went to see her she asked him  through the speaker why did you have to kill my daddy ?  that 's when graham had his nervous breakdown . 
if the tooth fairy listens to lecktor he 'll come for me .  so we 're going to set me up as bait to draw him out .  give him a clean shot .   that 's what you were thinking is n't it ? 
the usual motivation does n't apply to him nor the way he uses them .   i do n't have an answer for you .   listen to me my friend leave this . 
that 's probably in the part lecktor tore out .   at the top it says i hope we can correspond . and then the hole begins .   it looks like lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away . 
when do they go to press ? 
issue the toilet paper tear as a .  .  . 
that 's it .  lecktor called him a pilgrim when he was talking to me .  .  . 
you do n't need me .  i would n't be useful to you anymore jack . 
i am all right . 
i 'll come back later .  i got messages at the holiday inn to collect . 
mrs .  leeds' fingernails and toenails .  i think he took off his gloves jack .   and dust all the corneas of all their eyes . 
i do n't know jack .  he 's got no face for me . 
if the documents section ca n't do it .  .  .  i 'll send it up to langley .  .  . 
 .  .  . there 's three t 's' and an r' in tattler . 
it 's your call will .  what do we do ? 
when i 'm done . 
there has to be . 
you know you speak very well although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech .  at the riker institute for the blind .  i trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children .  .  . 
i 'll get it .   stay right here .  you look very good in the sun .  .  . 
who ? 
no mr .  lounds .  you 'll be just fine . 
my back hurts my skin .  did i get burned ?  i hope to god i 'm not burned . 
yes . 
i do n't know .  .  . 
'no' what ? 
absolutely
i get a lot of calls .  most of them are from people who say they know things . 
that 's true . 
he 's white and six feet tall .  you have n't told me anything yet . 
why do you think he took his gloves off ? 
yes .  intimate . they had privacy .   everybody else was dead . 
stay here with me .  me .  me .  me .   and kevin .   that 's selfish huh ? 
good for him .   thanks a lot freddie !   kevin .  we 're going grocery shopping . 
i 'd like one of your cigarettes please . 
i was out in the garden .  mama came out and told me when she saw it on tv .  why did n't you call me ? 
that 's not true . 
sure he is .  blond .   probably scandinavian too .  .  . 
yes .  is molly there ? 
i 'll come inside with you if you like but mr .  crawford said you 'd probably want to be alone . 
in this hatchery ?  forty to fifty . 
i 'll hang around in here .  i 'll just be in the kitchen mom .  .  . 
yes . 
yes .  hobbs had one of his daughters from behind .  he was cutting her .  i shot him . 
you 're insane . 
goodbye dr .  lecktor . 
because my dear will if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon he might go outside and look at it .   have you seen blood in moonlight will ?  it appears quite black .  if one were nude it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing . 
that 's interesting . 
i 'll study it will .  when you get more files i 'd like to see them too .  you can call me .  when i have to call my lawyer they bring me a telephone .  would you like to give me your home number ? 
you know lounds 's enlightened me on one thing your confinement in the mental hospital .  my attorney should have brought that our in court . 
yes . 
there 'll be other shots . 
of course !   but that does n't mean i do n't need everyone 's support !   i ca n't be surrounded by negative energy . 
i wanna go back to work and put on a happy show .   the best show anybody 's ever seen ! 
so who 's gonna pay for it ? 
you know tony does n't have that kind of money . 
yeah .  .  . 
well everyone else gets this place cookin' !   pal it 's hard for me to move the booze when you 're singin' pop goes the weasel . 
but that 's it .   i needed you to believe !   our family will be in the newspapers .   people will look and they 'll be touched .   because your emotions were honest ! 
do you wanna wrestle ?   it 's a good way of breaking the ice .   that instant physical intimacy really brings two people together . 
gosh .   gee lynne .  .  .  i was just so impressed with your wrestling moves .  ext .  movie theater  day
hey i love movie theater popcorn .  .  .  but that does n't mean i have to sit through on golden pond . 
do i wanna go to memphis and get married ? 
yes . 
you 're a wimp . 
no offense pal but i just do n't think you 're built for it .   these he men'll kick your ass !  !   they 're huge ! 
the wrestling .  .  .  the sexist remarks .  .  .  the foul language .  .  .  these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual .   it seems you have no respect for anything . 
but my neck hurts .  .  .  and i have a slight cough .  .  . 
it 's probably just a strained muscle . 
eh sure .   we 're trying to expand our audience base  and i know the college kids really love andy kaufman . 
we have no choice but to continue as planned .   deploy the sentinels .  immediately . 
know what ? 
you all look the same to me . 
the orders were for your protection . 
no way .   not possible . 
it 's choi . 
i know i know .   this never happened .   you do n't exist . 
hear what ? 
yes .   you see the truth is trinity that we humans have a place in the future .   but it 's not here .  it 's in the matrix . 
the matrix is n't real ! 
oh i disagree trinity .   i disagree .   i think the matrix is more real than this world .   i mean all i do is pull a plug here .   but there you watch a man die . 
really ? 
how many were there ? 
what happened to them ? 
you have to focus .   there is a phone .   wells and lake .   you can make it . 
there 's a small ledge .   it 's a short climb .   you can make it . 
they got to you first but they 've underestimated how important you are .   if they knew what i know you would probably be dead . 
be what ?   be real ? 
yes .   a singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines .  i must say i find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back toasting the new age .   i say almost funny . 
i did n't say that it would be easy neo .   i just said that it would be the truth . 
shit i 'm sorry . 
how did you know .  .  .  ? 
who are you ? 
geezus . 
when i asked him he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question .   they have to see it to believe it . 
from what ? 
what did she tell you ? 
 .  .  .  right as rain . 
nothing .   just had a little deja vu . 
what happened ?   what did you see ? 
how much like it ?   was it the same cat ? 
a deju vu is usually a glitch in the matrix .   it happens when they change something . 
morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out !   there 's no way you 're going back in ! 
no ?   let me tell you what i believe .  i believe morpheus means more to me than he does to you .   i believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since i am the ranking officer on this ship if you do n't like it then i believe that you can go to hell because you are n't going anywhere else . 
do what ? 
where is it ? 
the oracle . 
they 're hacking his mind . 
how ? 
how much time ? 
what do they want ? 
because i believe in something . 
guns .   lots of guns . 
he 's alive . 
so did we .   i sent him to franklin and erie . 
trinity we do n't have any other choice . 
hurry neo . 
yeah .   but he ai n't here now . 
know where he is ? 
sounds good . 
of course the season of the witch' wo n't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch . 
let go of her . 
yeah well keep away from those chinx .   they do n't have shit . 
hey !   you want good stuff or you want shit ? 
well my stuff comes from maryland .  .  .  you know what that means ?

so i think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that bruce lee arguably the greatest martial artist of all times developed for nine years that would be a fella who could defend himself .  would you describe tim that way grace ? 
grace .  i 'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother tim if you feel up to it . 
are we in a big hurry ? 
the prison board made the decision .  a board of which i belong .  we 're the who .  the why is simple .  mickey and mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor 's care where hopefully they 'll receive the help they need . 
so can we .  so the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy .  and we 're shippin' em to nystrom asylum for the criminally insane . 
tough titty it 's mine now . 
have you talked to mallory about this ? 
she does n't talk ? 
songs .  he 's a rebel' leader of the pack' town without pity' that dusty springfield song i only want to be with you' .  that 's what i hear anyway .  her behaviour was the main thing the doctors' report used against you .  so even if she would see me which she wo n't i could n't put her on camera anyway .  if i ask her mallory are you insane ? and she starts singing dead skunk in the middle of the road' that blows our whole case . 
all right mickey . 
let 's discuss it when i 'm unbound . 
what i did for fun for starters .   well something i used to do .  .  . always was a lot of fun .  .  .   no scratch that .  let me think of something else .  in fact why do n't we come back to that question .  ask me something else . 
of course i miss mallory .  she 's my wife .  i have n't seen her in a long time .  what a stupid question . 
was what worth it ? 
okay .  .  . okay .  .  . i 'll buy that .  we 'll move on and come back later . 
okay let 's cut it . 
and a snakeeye glare .

anything rated higher than a p . c . s got a hardwired suicide switch .  it 'll self destruct . 
sensenet taped a full spectrum personality construct on mccoy six months before his death .  everything dixie was  everything dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct .   of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of sensenet 's .

what about before that ? 
then you do n't really know who he is do you ? 
yeah . 
not when sensenet throws the going away party .  they 'll be on our asses from now on .

it just happened .   i did n't plan it .   i was alone .   and he was .  .  .  there .   but now everything 's changed .   i owe it to him to let him know .   i need to tell him . 
your great aunt .

ha un numero di telefono ? 
wait .   i have to write this down . 
no . 
please larry .   i have to hurry . 
what ?  .  .  . 
who 's this ? 
oh hi .   i 'm an old high school buddy of dwayne 's .   i was in town this weekend was hoping to stop by and surprise him .  but i 've gotta catch a plane so i 'm afraid i 'm not gonna be able to make it . 
right .   thanks a lot .   and congratulations .   it 's not easy finding love these days . 
if it 's any of your business yes . 
so ?  !   is there something wrong with loving somebody who 's safe ? 
look peter i do n't hate you .  but what we had was an illusion .  mutual wishful thinking .   we both wanted to believe it for awhile but it was all founded on a lie . 
who says i do n't love him ?  .  .  . 
where 's positano ? 
oh no i do n't think that would be a good idea . 
he likes to read .  .  .   did he mention anyone in particular ? 
mickey spillane . 
beautiful place .  .  . 
sure is . 
really ? 
uh the scampi sounds good to me too . 
mommy this is faith . 
let 's face it .   you want me . 
yeah well larry and his friends are hungry .   and i did say i 'd try to pick something up . 
no . 
well i would n't 've if i had n't thought i was in love . 
look how big it makes me look .   i look like an alp . 
it 's a coincidence . 
it 's still the new year .  .  . 
that 's where you 're wrong .   i got one nine years ago .   i just never had an opportunity to use it . 
of course not .   i told him i was going to visit a great aunt .   and do n't tell larry either . 
you 're just going to fly to italy and start combing the streets ? 
he was on his way to venice right ?  i called the tourist bureau and i must 've called every hotel in the city but i found where he 's staying .  
maybe . 
you 're coming with me ? 
sure .   i 'm fine .   i do n't know why i never did this before .   i mean what 's the big deal ? 
what ? 
well we 're here .   and more importantly he 's here .   we 'll cut back on everything else . 
a phone message .   only
only what ? 
not if you do n't count the sixth grade . 
faith .   so far you 've trailed the man halfway around the globe .   at this point i do n't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales . 
what ? 
and then what faith ? 
like a detective . 
 .  .  . and a fortune teller . 
i 'm just not ready to go home quite yet that 's all . 
you sure you 'll be okay ? 
but i do want to . 
what ?   you know him ? 
it was just a joke .   i was pushing the arrow .   i wanted to get to the next question .   i wanted to find out who was gonna win the series . 
are you saying you just made the whole thing up ?   the guy never even existed ? 
and you did n't tell her ? 
she 's not here . 
do you know i was n't even supposed to be in rome ?   my boss was supposed to come to this conference and at the last minute he got the measles .   the measles .  who gets the measles at fortythree ?   so they sent me .  and i was n't supposed to be in that piazza that night either .   i 'd gone to the movies only it was sold out .   so i was wandering around .  just wandering .  .  .   when i got hit in the head with this shoe . 
sorry .  .  . 
talk louder .  i ca n't hear you . 
if you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
what do you mean odd ?  we was robbed like i told you . 
thanks for the legal advice charley .  that 's what we always kept you around for .   now how do we keep him from giving this testimony ?  is n't that the er as you put it main order of business ? 
nolan ?  i knew he had guts but
how could anyone do this to joey .  the best in the neighborhood .  .  .   .  everybody said it not only me .  who 'd want to harm joey ?  tell me who ?    who ? 
you think i 'm just a gravytrain rider in a turnedaround collar ? 
you hear that terry ?   terry did you hear that ?   you lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war .  all you gotta do is walk . 
none of your business . 
it 's a regular college .  it 's just run by the nuns .  the sisters of st .  anne . 
it is n't brains .  it 's how you use them . 
some people got faces that stick in your mind . 
how would you 've done it ? 
i do n't know . 
good .  so do i . 
that was nice of you . 
i went pretty good for a while did n't i al ?  but i did n't stay in shape and  i had to take a few dives . 
should n't we care about everybody ? 
terry ! 
well nobody i guess .  but that father barry i did n't like the way he kept lookin' at me . 
yeah yeah .  .  .   .   this father barry what 's his racket ? 
i ca n't let myself fall in love with you . 
i 'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt what more do you want ? 
much more terry .  much much more ! 
there 's a hawk around .  they 're scared tonight . 
i know .  .  .  i know .  .  .   . 
you .  .  .   .

i 'm just resting my feet . 
jimmy suppose i knew something say a mug somebody put on somebody .  .  .   .   you think i should turn him in ? 
no . 
hey look

my favorite little cousin . 
takin' over this local you know it took a little doin' .  some pretty tough fellas were in the way .  they left me this  to remember them by . 
oh he did .  half an hour later a certain timothy j .  nolan went into secret session with the commission and he did all the talking . 
you want to know somethin' ? 
i 'm glad what i done today see ?  you give it to joey you give it to nolan you give it to charley who was one of your own .  you thought you was god almighty instead of a cheap connivinggoodfornothing bum !  so i 'm glad what i done you hear me ?  glad what i done ! 
when we knock off let 's have a bit of a party .  we 'll drink to god and ireland its whiskey and its women to joey and edie  and death to tyrants everywhere .  .  .   .  ! 
i wonder how many hail marys the father 'll make me say at confession .   it 'll be worth it !  the pallet is loaded now .  terry turns and approaches nolan . 
you do n't think he 'd be helpful ? 
no .   it 's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind . 
sure there areand i 've tried them all .   plays love stories westerns dog stories .   huh now there was a good one that dog story all about
well it 's probably just the caretaker and that 's exactly who we want to find .   they 'll have a telephone .   c 'mon . 
it 's an initiation all right but not of a college as you and i know them .   nothing alive looks like that ! 
yes i feel it in my bones . 
 .  .  . and i thought you loved me . 
all right .   put it on heavy . 
a symbol master . 
it would seem so master
when !  ? 
your own pleasure comes only after mine when i desire it .  i am the sole ruler of the dark world .   there is no one to challenge my authority here .  my word is the lawall powerful .  bno oneb is to challenge that authority bno one ! b .   is that understood ?   it is my command . 
all others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff compared to iheri  this one would have idiedi for feathers furs and fluff .  .  . and so she did ! 
you may take her now . 
is there time ? 
it 's not often an emperor like iyoui calls on creatures like us . 
you are the keepers of the damned .   you two know them all .  and i am tired of this usual type of entertainment .  i want .  .  . a decided change . 
i repulse you ?   very well .   it seems you have chosen your own fate .  live with it !   i should say bdieb with it ! 
yes around here .   i was a mayishan in cuba before i come here .   manuel the mayishan was my name . 
listen to me .   i 'm a good friend of jack foley . 
why you want to do that to a frien' ? 
there 's something about a nice hot bath transforms a person .   it 's not just about opening up your pores know what i mean ?   there 's just something about the heat and the wet that 's calming you know ?   settles me in a way that i really ca n't articulate . 
sounds great . 
i was n't feeling my best that day .  i 'd just drawn thirty to life . 
in here with my suntan lotion and beach towel .   that 's her place . 
i think glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner . 
they do n't stay the night jack less you pay for it . 
time comes we knock on the door .   see if he wants to talk about old times .  go in the easy way . 
yeah it 's called glades correctional institution and i 'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it . 
you find out ? 
they sure do . 
at least . 
really ?   huh .   he told me he did n't remember how many he robbed . 
in the trunk yeah ? 
oh .  .  .  different things prison movies . 
yeah but i had enough reason to believe he did and i told you .   so you had to at least suspect him . 
you say in the report glenn did n't have a gun but you let him get away too . 
daniel what do you work on most of the time fraud ?   go after crooked bookkeepers . 
you 'll have to ask him . 
what we already talked to her .   that 's a dead end . 
but do n't you udou anything .   you just have a seat wait for me to get there . 
sure daniel . 
oh .   then this must be adele .  .  . 
yeah but i see you moved it up . 
why you think is today ? 
you told me i can come cause i caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel saw you and lulu coming out of the bushes thought maybe you two were making out . 
i appreciate the offer .   and it 's tempting . 
yeah eddie was a real character .   had these girls cooked the rocks he called the rockettes . 
listen raymond a year ago dea had this guy glenn michaels on possession with intent but could n't make it stick .  in his statement glenn said he went up to detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities  if you can believe that . 
yeah . 
that 's right . 
faye dunaway . 
and the guy saying he was n't gonna take any more shit from anybody .  .  . 
you have to be kidding . 
you wo n't do that . 
something i 've been wondering what ever happened to your uncle cully ? 
i 'm a sales rep .   i came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because i 'm a girl . 
is that how you think of yourself ? 
i called your room from downstairs . 
well i 'd say who i was and do you remember me and ask if you 'd like to meet for a drink . 
she did huh . 
you kept touching me feeling my thigh . 
why not ? 
i could n't believe it .   i was thinking of you by then a lot wondering what it would be like if we did meet .   like if we could take a timeout .  .  . 
outside adele 's . 
do n't talk like that okay ?   you scare me . 
or i did it for some kind of kinky thrill .   score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade . 
i do n't know about that .   you ca n't do three falls and think you have much of a brain . 
you just did for christ sake . 
use your head .   the guys got five million lying around his house you really think he 's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it ? 
i do n't know .  .  . 
i hear six .

i do n't know .   i never used a gun . 
plus even it was true he 'd still have to figure out where i keep em . 
the next time i walk into a bank . 
islamic . 
i prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place . 
that time ? 
apparently yeah .   i was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal but for some reason she wanted to wait . 
i already stole it .   last week or whenever it was in west palm .   i ca n't be stealing it again can i ? 
the two guys you were with  that one that is n't maurice miller is it ?  i 've seen snoopy 's mug shot and that did n't look like him .

gee i wonder why not . 
you want to get out of here run it 'll warm you up .

studs .   hey son you must be one a them psychic friends .   i was just thinkin' about you . 
yeah .   if you can step up and actually do it .   understand ?   stead of just talking the talk .

yeah kenneth why you have to do that to that poor girl . 
he does n't seem to hold a grudge .   what iii want to know is why they got such a big score up north did foley hang around miami for so long ?   any thoughts on that one ? 
yeah .   sure .   it 's all settled .

i got a half a tank .   you ? 
home of the brave . 
i 'm out of fuel ! 
i ca n't make it . 
the brass is afraid of sabotage .   this makes em easier to protect  and easier to service . 
we got a saying here .   alowha ! 
we got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident but it 's quiet .   except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us . 
i swore not to talk about him tonight but there 's all this stuff i think i ought to tell you that he did n't get a chance to .   rafe was .  .  . he was lonely .   he had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty .   the week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring . 
hey have you seen pearl harbor at night ? 
from the air ? 
i 'm going to the war .   the real war .  hitler 's taken europe .   the brits are hanging on by their fingernails and if they lose there 'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine .   and not just there but here .

you passed up a dozen chances to arrest her .   what toughened you up ? 
that could be told . 
how could mitchell ?   after that act he put on up here is it likely she 'd let him in ? 
she did n't have to .   he could have climbed down from here . 
where did it all come from ?   or is that a permissible question ? 
lay off what ?  this is my new girl friend .  met her on the train .  she 's very fond of me .  love at first sight .  was n't it baby ?

he could have tried .   if he was up there in the dark listening he 'd know when she came home know when she found mitchell dead know what she did about it .   if she telephoned he 'd probably hear that . 
and she did give him the chance the way it worked out .

why not ?  you ca n't hurt me .  westley and i are joined by the bonds of love .  and you cannot track that .  not with a thousand bloodhounds .  and you cannot break it .  not with a thousand swords .  and when i say you are a coward that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth .

teddy called .   me .  .  .  and my mother called to see if teddy called .  oh and your sister called to say she 's going to tucson to do some buying and she 'll be gone the whole weekend and .  .  .

joseph is reading the diary which arouses his interest more and more .  it is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him .  an extract from the diary is shown . 
the blood transfusion continues .  marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp so that he can see nikolas in bright light while he himself sits in the dark .  nikolas watches lone 's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death .  life slowly seems to return to her and her breathing becomes more peaceful .  she opens her eyes and looks at the people round her but she is much too enfeebled to speak and closes her eyes again .  marc keeps a close watch on nikolas who grows paler and paler .  his eyes swivel slowly from nikolas to the patient and back to nikolas again . 
no  i did n't .  it was igor at the waxworks . 
but you were in on it  you worked for him . 
i do n't think you could have a real affair .  you could n't care for anyone .

yeah but they leave you plenty . 
well thank goodness that 's settled . 
she is n't anybody 's friend and i do n't like you living with her .  she 's a bad influence . 
what 's nice about her ?   .  .  .  a hardboiled little gold digger . 
do n't kid yourself  she means it . 
i 'm not quarreling only  .  .  . 
that 's the way i feel about it . 
and he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you .  let him think it was his fault  .  .  .  he should be along very shortly  .  .   .  but be very stern before you forgive him especially if it is your fault   .  .  .   while you 're waiting for your friend would you like to see some new figures i have downstairs ? 
stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner 's banquet and he says bring me a yarn .  all i have to do is get a story .

i told you what to do .  drive around the corner out of sight of the house .  i want to get a closer look at the place . 
and you think i will permit this my friend ? 
well what do you think i 'm in this for ?   think of it man a match  a cigar stub  and ten thousand pounds to divide between us ! 
that does n't seem so bad to me .  what is wrong with it ?

buddy you do n't realize it but what you 're doing is n't nice .

you 're my sweetheart . 
well he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day .  but i do n't know who he is buddy i really do n't . 
you do n't know the bedside manner that man has got .  why it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he 's gonna cure me which he did of course .  and even more important he loves me like a patient i mean the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat .

buddy .  .  .  does rose really .  .  .  do it with all those boys and men ? 
your wife and children are back in new hampshire in the snow ? 
that 's what she would say herself . 
i am afraid so son .  about a week ago .  her husband phoned me she had asked him to call me if anything happened . 
yes we know her . 
umhmm .  almost too perfect . 
well i 'll admit i do n't see any flies on her yet . 
well she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in birmingham even if she did run away from them . 
why they wo n't either .  she looks pretty .  and i wish you would n't pick on the poor girl all the time .  do n't listen to him rose you look pretty even beautiful . 
just halfacup of coffee .  i never eat darlin' you know that .  not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses .  let 's go rose you and brother let 's hit the road . 
he and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children . 
i do n't see any bruises or broken bones . 
rose my patience is wearing thin .  first a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away .  this is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show . 
it is n't her fault if she 's popular .  .  .  what ? 
what she does n't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people .  she 's young she 's got to learn to restrain the life force that 's in her .  its creative but in her case it 's too creative . 
i 'll talk to her i 'll reason with her . 
honey please .  .  . 
i do n't care where the polecat studied . 
i forgot that rose will lie like a child .  she 's no more pregnant than i am she just does n't want to go to that farm ! 
fine . 
is anything wrong ? 
no sir . 
well good night . 
good god almighty .  this is a catastrophe they wo n't hire her . 
it 's so mr .  hillyer . 
what was it mr .  hillyer ? 
oh .  oh god .  of course dave how are you ? 
that 's correct  outside it not in it .  as for the job well the jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ai n't worth a sorryass damn .   but i can build anything buddy .  give me the plans and i can build a goddamn staircase to the moon .  it 's a fact i can build anything .  .  .    .  .  .  but she never believed that .  oh hell no she never believed in me . 
ahh if you happen to run into rose sometime .  .  .  do me a favor give her a message for me will you ? 
daddy would n't hear that .  now the redhaired boy you see sitting there of course you have met him he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child .  all children have great creative powers but i do n't want to rattle on about my children they say i brag too much about them especially about brother .  am i boring you rose ? 
a tenant farm ?  are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt ? 
do n't worry madam she ca n't infect your dear little kiddies .  she long ago fully recovered but the disease did irreparable damage .  the girl is permanently barren . 
she 's an adult mrs .  hillyer i was merely giving her the facts . 
i understand you perfectly .  you leave that girl alone you wretched man or you will be sorry . 
you can stop it right now . 
more history rose . 
well i am working on my thesis . 
rose you work too hard .  why do n't you go sit down somewhere and drink a cocola ? 
i like to work .  i do n't mind work .  it 's the least i can do after all you and mr .  hillyer have done for me .   you 're so sweet .  there never was nobody like you . 
yes ma 'am . 
yeah it 's kinda nice . 
rose really you should n't act like that . 
oh i know .  but i did n't really .  honestly i did n't .  there was only one but he 's out of town and leave no forwardin' address . 
i was offered that job as a waitress . 
well .  .  .  well that 's wonderful rose . 
and who do you suppose he is ?  that policeman who arrested me the one i bit !  he is mr .  right ! 
maybe i 'm not making myself clear .  you 're probably the first girl billyboy 's ever fallen in love with and i know for sure you 're the first he 's slept with .   so how 's he gonna feel .  .  .    .  .  .  when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who did n't have to pull out at the last second to get his closeup ? 
if i tell you how do i know you wo n't just club me and take it back ? 
i do n't know what you 're talking about man .   even if i did i 'm not so crazy i 'm gonna cross zimmermann . 
that was n't my fault .

no one knows .   he bought the election a few years back .   he 's been rulin' toontown ever since . 
a hundred bucks ?   that 's ridiculous . 
yeah but i enlarged this one .   thought you might be interested . 
stop what ? 
that was the idea . 
no you gotta understand valiant i had nothin' to do with acme gettin' killed .   i just wanted to sell my studio .   but they would n't buy my property unless acme would sell his .  and he would n't .   so i was gonna blackmail acme with pictures of him and the rabbit 's wife . 
well i asked the newsboy on the corner .   he did n't know .   then i asked a janitor the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way .   he was very helpful . 
well no not uanyu time .   only when it was funny . 
how do you know that ? 
if you do sir i am for you .   i serve as good a man as you . 
goodmorrow cousin . 
not having that which having makes them short . 
out of her favour where i am in love . 
alas that love so gentle in his view should be so tyrannous and rough in proof ! 
well in that hit you miss she 'll not be hit with cupid 's arrow nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes nor open her lap to saintseducing gold
art thou hurt ? 
he shall be endured
go to !  what goodman boy !  i say he shall go to make a mutiny among my guests ?  !

romeo o romeo !  wherefore art thou romeo ?  deny thy father and refuse thy name or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love and i 'll no longer be a capulet . 
a thousand times good night !  exit above
a thousand times the worse to want thy light .  love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books but love from love toward school with heavy looks . 
mercutio 's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company ! 
by my count i was your mother much upon these years you are now a maid .  thus then in brief the valiant paris seeks you for his love . 
nay bigger women grow by men . 
is love a tender thing ?  it is too rough too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn . 
true i talk of dreams which are the children of an idle brain begot of nothing but vain fantasy which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind who wooes even now the frozen bosom of the north and being anger 'd puffs away from thence turning his face to the dew dropping south . 
pink for flower . 
'twill serve .  ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man .  a plague o' both your houses .  they have made worms meat of me .  a plague on both your houses !  why the devil did you come between us ?  i was hurt under your arm . 
i do n't want you dead woman i want the the truth ! 
some places not all .   italy for instance they 're serious about their food .   but try bloody britain anywhere in the u . k .  you do n't get much fancier than a deepfried bar egg .   food 's not our thing you see . 
best beer in the world known to man or god . 
best beer in the world ?   budweiser for me thanks . 
they 're good ! 
whatever you wish .  .  .   this has all been a terrible mistake gregor .   i wanted to play straight with you but edvard insisted we try and kill you . 
because if there 's more than one party involved if we really are working for different people then perhaps some of us are on different sides .   your orders might be different from mine . 
of course .   do n't you ? 
it gets done now or not at all .   another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where i ca n't get them . 
did he bring that with him ? 
i blast the lead car into oblivion .  .  . 
is that right ? 
i know cops  and you 're no cop . 
things .   this is my country you know . 
something like that .  .  . 
i do n't .   but the language he 's speaking is universal . 
exactly .   why not bring them ? 
they certainly are .   whatever it is we 're going to steal it must be quite something . 
you were n't around when i woke up i thought maybe something had happened .   this has been one very fucked up job sam and i 'm not taking any more chances on anybody .  .  .   including you .  .  . 
of course .  .  . whenever you feel like it just help yourself . 
i have a feeling i 'm about to start buying my own . 
i wo n't lie  there have been times when i had to do it times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man did n't . 
not necessarily .   he could go off road at any number of places .   he might not even be in the country anymore . 
i did n't save your life back there .  risked it maybe  but i did n't save shit . 
no hospitals .   i 'll fix this myself if i have to . 
fix it yourself ?   why are we even doing this ?   there 's no need to run christ .  .  .   you 're a cop . 
it is n't about money for me not anymore . 
it 's my job . 
it 's a cover then .   a cover within a cover a feint within a feint .   you work for the cia it 's the only possible answer . 
dark operations .   wet work .   kidnaping .  assassination . 
you were behind the door ? 
how could you have done that ? 
you said it yourself gregor 's not dead .  if they had the package they 'd have killed him . 
i do n't know .  .  . 
you do n't know ?   bullshit you had her there was no way out . 
right now ? 
something like that . 
hey dwayne why do n't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin ? 
looks like some kind of drug deal or something they 're not from around here   one of them 's still alive . 
shit more than that . 
look around you partner !   you said yourself you never saw anything like it . 
why ? 
who 's going to question us ?  dwayne ?   jesse ?

i do n't think he 's going to be doing any bargaining with us the stupid sonofabitch !   besides i 'm not giving him a third of anything not after everything we had to do . 
not bad enough to kill him . 
i sure as hell hope so .   let 's go . 
then we 're screwed . 
we 'll take the money and disappear !  we can do it spend it on the move .  even if all of it 's marked there 's ways around it . 
i 'm not sure why .   it 's just i 've never been anywhere else .  .  . 
we had hounds down at the scene the footprint trail was a bust .  and there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity . 
well you can understand why we did n't say anything .   if word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us . 
dwayne . 
hi . 
have i seen her ? 
i mean at least pick a more discreet place the scalp under the armpit under the tongue someplace where the trained eye wont immediately look . 
no .   but what i would like is the forty dollars you owe me and im a busy man . 
where 's the hot back  the therapeutic pad thing ? 
not much to tell .   nothing really happened . 
what ? 
i was on a roll !   im a little overextended now .

i wanted you to ask back there .   you know before you got us lost . 
quit feeling sorry for yourself tom .  it gets old . 
but that 's okay liz you 're the one with the steady job you pay all the bills .  i 'm just an unemployed musician .   you have every right . 
that is so unfair . 
do n't we always take good care of you ? 
sir ? 
the numbers do n't make sense sir .  his brothers are dead that 's too bad but they 're out of the equation .  sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away .   one private is simply not worth a squad .   colonel anderson this one is .   he 's worth a lot more than that .   which is why i 'm sending you you 're the best field officer there is . 
i do n't make jokes about things of or related to the preaching of the holy gospel including the ministerial calling of my family . 
so they travel around from place to place and preach ? 
hell no .   i think he 's the best officer in the whole goddamned army bar none . 
it seemed appropriate . 
thank him and tell him we 're sorry about his loss . 
i changed my mind . 
what about the company ? 
twenty minutes ago .   miller damn i 'll go see if i can find another one .   you get reiben jackson and wade meet me at transport . 
that 's not what we 're here for . 
how about you shut up and take your position ? 
vecchio . 
you know why i 'm such a good officer ?  because of my mother .   have i ever told you about her ? 
bits and pieces . 
she 's the best poker player you ever saw .   my father used to go to these saturday night games and lose his shirt .   finally my mother gave him an ultimatum either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every saturday night .  he squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down she never lost .   she could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands .   and he bluffs ?   he had sixteen levels of bullshit .   her eyes the tone of her voice her bets her jokes the way she sipped her coffee she was a master .   she won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game .  every saturday night my father would lose two three hundred bucks and she 'd win it all back and then some .  and i 'd stand there glued to her shoulder from the time i was five years old watching every hand every move studying how she did it .   that 's why i 'm such a good officer i can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he 's holding and if it 's a shit hand i know just what cards to deal him . 
do n't worry we 're the only rangers this side of the continent we 've got to be first into caen . 
no i 'm not kaback is honest .   or what about faulkner ?   or that little guy with the glasses ? 
but i am a captain .   if i were not a captain i would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a topnotch poker player which i am having learned at the side of my mother who is by popular acclaim the best poker player in .  .  . 
yes sir as a final note i 'd like to say fuck our orders fuck ramelle fuck the cheese capital of france and while we 're at it fuck private james ryan . 
i 'll make a note of your suggestions but i 'll leave that last one to you especially if he 's already dead . 
we ca n't leave it here . 
i do n't like that one . 
maybe .   but what if he dies on the way back ?   you see what i 'm saying sir ?   the best possible situation is he 's dead we find his body more or less intact we grab one of his dogtags and hightail it back to the beach or better yet we head over to caen and catch up with division . 
no sir . 
looks like tea time maybe they 're brits . 
get back to your positions ! 
 .  .  . for you to blow up yeah yeah we heard that . 
what are we likely to run into ? 
pardon me ? 
for going to school ? 
i still am . 
i already did . 
the world is full of guys .   be a man .   do n't be a guy . 
you 've got to show her respect you 've got to show her that you 're not like joe .  .  . 
well you do n't have to be so dramatic about it . 
alright . 
lloyd why do you have to be like this ? 
oh yeah ! 
i love you too honey . 
tell me is it bad news ? 
you 're going to take a big step a big leap and before you do i just want one thing from you miss .   you stand up straight and admit you 're special . 
i knew how planes flew but i was still a little nervous . 
so anyway these two federal marshals meet the plane and they take our address and they ask us never to fly with friendly skies' again . 
bon voyage . 
well listen to me .   now i know you like him i know he 's nothing like those frat kids you ca n't stand but honey after the excitement wears off then what huh ?   what are you going to talk about ?   what do you have in common ?   you 're going to be part of an international thinktank and he 's going to be kicking punching bags . 
wait wait .   you told her about me ? 
no . 
yeah .   with potential . 
here are some blankets .   this is a good song this is a really good song . 
your letter came yesterday .

she figured it out .   i 'm sorry if that upsets you .

seriously lloyd . 
go ahead pick it up if you want . 
i just wanted to say that i 've thought about everything and i 've decided something .   i 'm going to give you another chance .   maybe no one 's listening or maybe your father 's listening .   mr court if you 're listening to this hello how are you ? 
that 's one of the things i wanted to talk to you about sir .

no way .

i think it 's too late . 
well sure .   so would i .   so would you .  i would n't worry about it .   we 'll get it right one of these days . 
no ? 
there will be generations because of what you did . 
i did n't do enough . 
you did so much . 
he was a metal press operator quite skilled . 
no we got pressure from california state .  the man practically has clemency .  we ca n't run the risk of falsely accusing him .  he has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move .

i wo n't . 
someone who wants to talk to you . 
who do you want to speak with ?  nobody 's here . 
what if i said you ?

i also know that you 're an aging tv reporter slash writer who despite huge tabloid success has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a nonpositive manner .  a coupla failed relationships withi 'm guessing balding older menhave turned you into this bitch with a cell phone .  but i bet sometimes late at night when you 're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled . 
not good . 
he 's already gotta be a part of sid 's life .  what do you know about this derek ?

it 's been a year since she died . 
no billy .  i 'm the one who 's been selfish and selfabsorbed with all of my post traumatic stress . 
yeah .  .  .  and when i called no one answered . 
fuck you . 
you 're forgiven .  bye now . 
they 've got 900 numbers for that .  seeya . 
uhhuh .

then answer the question .  same category . 
it was jason .  i saw that goddamned movie twenty times .  it was jason . 
what ? 
i know who you are ma 'am .  how 's the eye ? 
i know i should be in new york covering the sharon stone stalker but who knew ?  please call me gale .  you look awfully young to be a police officer . 
we 're tracking the cellular phone bill . 
we have n't ruled out that possibil .  .  . 
no !  i mean .  .  .  i should probably take just you . 
have you contacted the bureau ? 
but it 's so much easier when we make it up . 
i want to talk to you . 
what is your problem ?  you got what you wanted .  cotton weary is in jail .  they 're gonna gas him .  a book is not gonna change that . 
has his story changed ? 
and why is that ? 
because they 're all the same .  it 's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl  who ca n't act  who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door .  they 're ridiculous . 
that is so unoriginal .  you disappoint me randy . 
so where are you ? 
no ?  oh well .  .  .  i 'm hitting the sack .  my flight leaves first thing in the morning .  now the expo runs all weekend so i wo n't be back til sunday .  there 's cash on the table and i 'll be staying at the raleigh hilton .  .  . 
because obviously they do n't watch enough movies .  this is standard horror movie stuff .  prom night revisited . 
why are you doing this ? 
it 's all part of the game . 
you 'll never get away with this . 
how do you gut someone ? 
you 're wound too tight mills .   let it go . 
there are seven deadly sins .   gluttony wrath greed .  .  . 
i know what you 're thinking okay ?   you do n't want to get in bed with this every night but it 's different now .   you 're retiring .   in six days you 're all the way gone . 
hello . 
i visited your home this morning after you left . 
what makes you so special that people should pay attention ? 
not me .   i 'm not special .   i 'm not exceptional .   this is though .   what i 'm doing . 
well i 'll be standing beside you the whole time so you be sure to let me know when this whole complete reality thing is done .   would n't want to miss it . 
delusions of grandeur . 
what the fuck is going on ? 
because i envy your normal life .   envy is my sin . 
all this effort you 've made to get transferred it 's the first question that pops into my head . 
i just do n't think we should have that sort of relationship .   we 'd start quarreling over insignificant things . 
have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink ?   near the food ? 
and if it 's a threat . 
right .   but there pride comes first not gluttony .   the sins are in a different order . 
attrition .   when you regret your sins but not because you love god . 
the marquis de sade and origins of sadism . 
who told you about my silver tongue ?   you been talking to my wife ? 
i 'm fine . 
we need a warrant . 
these murders are his masterwork .   his sermon to all of us .   to all us sinners . 
one birthday he gave me this brand new hardcover book the century of the detective by jurgen thorwald .   it traced the history of deduction as a science and it sealed my fate because it was real not fiction .   and that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime .  .  .  it was incredible to me . 
no .   face it now .   stop thinking it 's good guys against bad guys . 
you do your job .  .  . 
listen to yourself .   you say the problem with people is they do n't care so i do n't care about people .   but you 're already here .   you 've been here a long time .   so there 's a part of you that knows even if everything you say is true none of it matters . 
big surprise . 
well i have to tell you .  .  .   i think i 've fallen in love with you . 
i do n't see anything . 
what ? 
no matter how often i see guns i still ca n't get used to them .

well .  .  . 
can of itself be a problem . 
royalty ? 
just like a ghost ship huh ? 
i do n't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is jane .  because i do n't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw marty in his wheelchair . 
it was brady 's idea jane .  honest to god .  please take the money .  i want to make up . 
what do you expect when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed ?

i said i was a nun not an asshole . 
hey sisters .   are you going in there ? 
yes betty ? 
oh my !  
he 's so dreamy .   he 's like .  .  .  a greek god .   he 's the cutest guy here .     he 's boss .   he 's fab .   he 's .  .  . 
d00lang doolang d00lang . 
why ? 
you betcha . 
i love my heddles .   show me again . 
i know .   it 's ancient . 
am i ? 
and we know that even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite the lowest slug of humanity !  we know that deep down inside you 're probably even worse .   and so you truly need our prayers . 
what a shame ! 
mary robert . 
i knew that . 
i hear you .   how many days a week do you rehearse ? 
wet behind the ears . 
again ! 
well .  .  .  see at my old convent i was n't always .  .  .  real popular .   i was sort of selfish and .  .  .  not real helpful .   okay i 'll say it  i was n't much of a nun .  but now thanks to all of you .  .  .  maybe i 'm shaping up . 
that 's true would n't that be great .   of course we never know when things are going to change .   any one of us could be transferred to another convent tomorrow . 
five a . m .  ? 
i .  .  .  i .  .  . 
i .  .  .  i brought you something . 
a novice . 
yeah like a learner 's permit right ?  when do you hit the big time ?   you know when do you take the final vows ? 
right sure but what 's the problem ?  are they keeping you a prisoner here ?  do they drug you ?   did reverend mother like kidnap your parents ?   we can call the enquirer . 
she wo n't ?   why not ? 
she said that ?   reverend mother ? 
again ? 
what is your full name ?   your christian name ? 
mother theresa .   gandhi .   do n't you understand ?   this is all a mistake .   i 'm the good guy .   i 'm the witness .   and i 'm being punished ! 
the reason ? 
you see ?   you see ?   i have to get out of here   i have to make a phone call .  do n't you get  it ?   i 'm in a convent !  you 're a nun ! 
and all those like you . 
as of now and until you leave you are sister mary clarence . 
like to who ? 
i 'm outta here . 
a fast .   to remind us of the poor of those who must endure without enough to eat . 
our lives are simple .   we have little need for material possessions . 
your cell is more than adequate . 
i got it . 
those girls were asking questions .  they 've got it rough .   i wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age .   i wish somebody would talk to me about it now . 
we are nuns .   we seek solutions through prayer . 
how to put it .  .  .  ah of course mary clarence .   no pain no gain . 
look .  .  .  i know i should n't have i 'm incredibly sorry about mary robert i was n't thinking i did n't know that would happen ! 
mary clarence i have given you every opportunity .   to change .   to make a decent life for yourself . 
a decent life ?   excuse me ?   as what ?   a janitor ? 
i am ? 
you have a phone call . 
saving you .   move ! 
oh ? 
oh yeah ?  well how do you think i felt ?  you were singing in bowling alleys back then .   i told people you were a hooker ! 
you 'd lose .   you 'd die .   all over the sidewalk .   and into the street . 
everywhere but this little holeinthe wall convent .   nobody knows you 're here but me .   we 're trying to get a quick court date .   a month maybe two tops .  i 'll spring you as soon as i can . 
you sonofabitch ! 
she 's counting on it .   she 's concerned for your safety but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you .  or a carnival . 
i really ca n't talk about it now .   the place is packed .   sro .   i 've got a show to do . 
no  worried about you .   personally . 
how ? 
that depends .   sisters you do n't know this but reverend mother 's been making all sorts of noises about resigning .  that 's bad news .   i do n't know if we could sing if we thought that was true . 
jerusalem is a real drag .   everybody hates me . 
a hiding place . 
you wo n't even tell us ? 
you found him  but we 're not open yet . 
all right .   it 's a beginning .   las vegas nevada . 
which convent was that sister ? 
it 's no use .   she just is n't here . 
we 'll pray  and she 'll be there . 
yes ? 
st .  katherine 's is a benedictine order .  you have taken a vow of hospitality .   to all in need . 
it 's that call you were expecting vince . 
are you nuts ?   she 's not a nun .   it 's christy .   she 's a babe ! 
i hit him square . 
i say is there any one person suspect in these acts ? 
to place it inside its coffin . 
the heads were not found severed .  the heads were not found at all . 
i cannot proceed without examining the previous victims . 
your superiors are two days away ! 
of course .   you want them .  .  .  it shall not take long .   wait here . 
but how many innocents rot here ?  and how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets ? 
should we go back ? 
let loose his silent shrieking .  who knows till we work at it ?   i admit not being anxious to find out .   he who holds the horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand .  whatever the horseman's desire is other than extinguishing lives . 
did your father take a loan ? 
things have become complicated .  katrina is at the mill .   ride ahead find her and bring her to meet me outside the church .   find her at all costs .   quickly . 
take the reins . 
i doubt that 's the end . 
feel free to form your own opinion .   though it appears you already have . 
the massive fellow .  .  .  brom .   for someone you call friend he misplaces a good portion of jealousy . 
which may explain his temperament .  to have asked twice means the answer was no at least once . 
are you so superstitious ? 
may i ask .  .  .  why do you cover your book that way ? 
i um .  .  .  i have something to show you if you have a moment . 
i have had them since childhood .   i cannot remember what from . 
then i also have a gift for you .  true magic which even you will not be able to deny . 
that would be a pity .   those words might show you something you 've never seen before . 
what are you on about ? 
to avenge his father and the others . 
but why ?   tell me why . 
no .   get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump . 
use caution . 
what .  .  .   ? 
close your mouth !   keep silent . 
well it 's not too big in here is it ?   i feel very generous today .  i feel like listening .  i 'm sure you have plenty to tell me .  and please bore me with the details .    come on karl who did you kill ?  was it the boy ? 
i ai n't sayin' it 's right .  i 'm just tellin' the truth .  what was he in the nuthouse for ? 
he had of went nuts and did somethin' .  they do n't put you in there for just bein' a retard .  they 's retards all over the place that ai n't in the nuthouse .  do you know frank ? 
you 're not crippled .  get in there and make somethin' . 
you do n't have to do anything but pour some potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low . 
too late honey .  fooled you .  done called him .  he 'll be here .   or i 'll go get him .  come on karl i need you to help me ice down a tub of beer you and frank . 
do n't tell me what to do . 
what do you want hun ? 
naw hell let them stay here with me and do men things .  there might be some kind of ball game on we can watch .  you go on . 
i 'll be back in a little bit then . 
i hate you ! 
i know albert .  we 're friends . 
oh yeah i 'm thrilled . 
sarcastic right ?   you know the boys in the band are probably gonna stay over tonight .  we 'd be glad to have you . 
that 's funny .   you go to bed and take snot nose with you . 
pick up the fuckin' phone and call em i guess . 
i aim to kill you with it . 
here give me the flowers i 'll do something with them .  thank you .  now you better go .  maybe i 'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something .  i have a boyfriend now you know .  and we 're pretty serious .  he gave me a ring . 
you do n't seem like you 'd kill nobody . 
they sell some of everything .  come on let 's go .  i wo n't tell her about you bein' in the state hospital for killin' . 
naw .  did n't have too much .  enough to scrape by on i reckon . 
my mother 's dead .  my daddy 's s 'posed to be around still .  he do n't want to have nothin' to do with me though . 
'cause he did n't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to .  that 's what the letter said .  he got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs .  i thought he took care of us fine .   karl did you really kill somebody ? 
i thought they was . 
i do n't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it 's made out of . 
yeah . 
that 's than un on christmas i was tellin' you about . 
you want to go with me ? 
i was wantin' to ask you somethin' . 
you ort not to pull on yourself that away . 
you do n't seem like a daddy .  you seem like a brother .   wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you do n't even know em like what happened with me and you . 
i do n't reckon i know . 
why ? 
yes sir .  right then it was . 
i heared it cryin' a little through that box . 
i 've studied about it .  the bible says not to or you end up goin' to hades .  some folks calls it hell i call it hades . 
you will ?  for sure ? 
hit do n't make no difference where i was to be .  we 'll always be friends .  there ai n't no way to stop that .   i aim for you to have these books . 
i aim fer you to have em . 
i 've got a feelin' today . 
reckon what kind of a feelin' ? 
okay . 
i 'm glad of it honey . 
did vaughan go home ? 
huh ? 
we 've had a real hard life too mama . 
i reckon . 
me too . 
well that 's a very offensive way to put it .  you should n't say that .  you were taught that were n't you ? 
oh .  how about before that ? 
before that i was thinkin' it 'd be good if i could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry . 
okay . 
naw not yet .   i want ye to give this to mizz wheatley .  hit ai n't much but maybe there 's a little somethin' to hep out .  hits what i 've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer bill cox . 
in a few minutes we 're gonna be in a room with a killer .  that does n't bother you ? 
melvin go get karl and take him down to the old classroom . 
i knew he slept in a toolshed . 
your dissertation ?  what subject do you study ? 
uh  .  .  .  actually it might be better if you read the story first .  call me when you 're finished okay ? 
huh ? 
uh sure sol .  anything you say .  instead of saying one corned beef sandwich and then another corned beef sandwich i 'll say two corned beef sandwiches . 
the queen of england ? 
not elizabeth the second elizabeth the first .   did you ever hear of sir walter raleigh ? 
i did n't know you took pictures . 
taking pictures ?   it 's a long story .  i 'd need two or three drinks to get through that one . 
but they 're all the same . 
help ?  hmm .  it 's possible .  what did you have in mind ? 
no he 's not .  you are . 
it 's written all over you like a neon sign .  now say something nice to rashid to make him feel better . 
fuck you kid . 
for once in my life i managed to keep my mouth shut .  there 's something to be said for that i suppose . 
it 's tommy 's .  the sucker owed me a favor . 
you usually get two . 
anything good ? 
okay .   so this is the story of how it happened .   okay .   it was the summer of seventysix back when i first started working for vinnie .  the summer of the bicentennial .   a kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store .  he 's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt .  it was crowded around the counter just then so i did n't see him at first .  .  .  . 
once about three or four months later .  i felt so bad about stealing the camera i had n't even used it yet .  i finally made up my mind to return it but granny ethel was n't there anymore .  someone else had moved into the apartment and he could n't tell me where she was . 
she probably died . 
yeah probably . 
i lied to her and then i stole from her .  i do n't see how you can call that a good deed . 
anything for art eh paul ? 
and now you 've got your christmas story do n't you ? 
i do n't want to talk about it .   if you really want to know .  i lost it .  and i 'm not sorry i did .  that eye was cursed auggie and it never gave me nothing but grief . 
i 've got something to talk to you about and the least you can do is listen .  you owe me that much .  i drove all the way from pittsburgh to see you and i 'm not going until you 've heard me out . 
do n't look at me like that .  auggie .  it gives me the creeps . 
i do n't know who else to turn to auggie . 
you were n't so lukewarm yourself .  at least at first . 
dammit auggie do n't ask so many questions .  just get in the car . 
wait till you see her auggie . 
you told me you wanted to meet him .  wellhere he is . 
i do n't have much choice do i ?  it 's pretty clear she does n't want me around . 
i 'd never be able to talk her into it .  and even if i could those things cost money .  and that 's just what i do n't have .  i 'm flat out dead broke . 
i should stop smoking these damn things is what i should do .  the fuckers are going to kill me one day . 
come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o 'clock and we 'll talk about it okay ?  we 'll see what we can work out . 
sure thing .  see you later . 
shit .  i do n't want your money you little twerp .   it 's probably stolen anyway . 
and these ? 
thomas cole .  thomas jefferson cole .  my nephew . 
you mean rashid ? 
well whatever his name is he 's not here anymore .  he left two days ago and i have n't heard from him since . 
his parents ?  is that what he told you ?  his parents ? 
he goes to john jay high school in brooklyn . 
i was about to get run over by a car and your nephew pulled me back .  he saved my life .   i sensed he was in trouble so i offered to put him up for a few days .  maybe i should have pressed him a little more i do n't know .  i feel pretty stupid about it now . 
well one thing i suppose but i do n't think it has anything to do with this .   a friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she 'd spotted thomas 's father working at some gas station outside of peekskill . 
henry told cyrus he 'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again .  when henry makes a threat like that people tend to take him seriously . 
let me give you some useful information son .  there 's two dollars and fiftyseven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you 've put in casing the joint so far you wo n't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains .  however you slice it that 's a losing proposition . 
it 's rundown all right .  but drawing a picture wo n't improve the way it looks .   let 's see what you did rembrandt . 
i 'm afraid we 'll be working on a strictly freelance basis . 
and how long did i tell you you could stay ? 
it sounds like our time is up does n't it ? 
take good care of yourself okay ? 
cut it out will you ?  just cut it out and come back here . 
it might not be far but it 's another galaxy .  black is black and white is white and never the twain shall meet . 
maybe .  or maybe it 's the other people who do n't belong . 
thanks .  
if you do n't sleep you do n't dream .  if you do n't dream you do n't have nightmares . 
come on just a little hint . 
yeah well you have to be nuts to do what you did .  if you want my opinion you should give this money back to the creeper .  just give it back and tell him you 're sorry . 
i suppose so .  he never told me about it . 
i 'm not going to do it . 
medium rare please . 
yes please . 
what are you sellin' em for ?  why do n't we start there . 
well if the blood got uontou the gaff by crushing a man's skull .  .  . 
they fished t 'gether .   went to school .  carl junior treated him like a white person .   like any friend . 
second question .   what did ole jurgensen pay you per acre ? 
unwritten rule of the sea .   we do n't bother each other stick to ourselves .  ask anybody . 
course if carl lost both batteries dead in the water his radio would n't work .   so how would he signal for help ? 
and then something did .   carl heine was found dead .   with his head crushed . 
it 's not for the .   they only get to convict him . 
agnostics do n't believe or disbelieve ma .   we just do n't pretend we know . 
it was my specialty sir i trained several thousand over the years . 
from carl heine 's boat .   all his were like this one threestrand manila new condition braided in loops .   not bowlined like miyamoto 's . 
should have told everything' .  meaning you should have told the utruthu . 
i had a spare battery in my shed .  i brought it down and put it in just before the sheriff showed up . 
some seaman's loast report .  stuffed in a cabinet good as lost forever .   no one knows . 
no you do n't . 
fell . 
well anything coulda caused that . 
mr .  gudmundsson we uknowu what that jury is looking at . 
so the defendant went out fishing for the night with unou spare battery hmmn ? 
obviously . 
is it possible ? 
yes you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased 's right hand .   the report says recent origin' .   how recent ?   as much as 24 hours before death ? 
so the defendant was encouraged to hope .   or could have been . 
i ca n't speak for him . 
bye . 
listen doll  what time do you get off tonight ? 
are n't you a little too young for that sonny ? 
all right girls  from the top again . 
it 's twelve bucks .   we can get one of the overcoats out of hock . 
i 'll think of something .   do n't crowd me . 
no  nothing .   besides it 's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off 
we got to get out of town .   maybe we ought to grow beards . 
quit stalling .   we 'll miss the train . 
watch it daphne ! 
when i was a kid i used to have a dream  i was locked up in this pastry shop overnight  with all kinds of goodies around  jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and boston cream pie and cherry tarts 
boy would i like to borrow a cup of that sugar . 
why do i let you talk me into these things ?  why ? 
i 'm engaged . 
congratulations .   who 's the lucky girl ? 
but you 're not a girl .   you 're a guy !  and why would a guy want to marry a guy ? 
look stop treating me like a child .  i 'm not stupid .   i know there 's a problem . 
like what ? 
but joe  this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire ! 
but they 're from osgood .   he wanted me to wear them tonight . 
do n't worry .   we did the right thing with it . 
there you go with that we again . 
there 's a convention all right .   there 's also the ladies' morgue . 
terribly sorry . 
we wo n't tell anybody  not even josephine . 
i 'm not crowding you am i ? 
i 'm not that sick . 
i have a very low resistance . 
you got some ? 
i 'm fine . 
when ? 
that 's from carrying around the bull fiddle . 
i 'm not surprised . 
they got a cuban band that 's the berries .  why do n't we go there  blindfold the orchestra  and tango till dawn ? 
sorry . 
why not ? 
well to begin with i 'm not a natural blonde . 
and i smoke .  i smoke all the time . 
and i have a terrible past .   for three years now i 've been living with a saxophone player . 
well  nobody 's perfect . 
nellie get me long distance .   what is it ? 
the instruments are right but you are not .   i want to speak to mr .  morris . 
oh . 
i play the ukulele .   and i sing too . 
all the girls drink  but i 'm the one that gets caught .   that 's the story of my life .  i always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop . 
you know  i play tenor sax . 
that 's why i joined this band .  safety first .   anything to get away from those bums . 
that 's a quarter of a century .  makes a girl think . 
glasses ? 
would you mind terribly ? 
she does n't need one .   i do n't have one either . 
my fault . 
now really 
are you staying at the hotel ? 
certainly not .   with all that unrest in the world i do n't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve . 
no my flag steward . 
no  the ukulele .   and i sing . 
well  a group of us are appearing at the hotel .  sweet sue and her society syncopators . 
 and always the same four hundred . 
i only come ashore twice a day  when the tide goes out . 
if it 's at all possible 
shells ?   whatever for ? 
it 's the thought that counts . 
it 's sort of funny  you being out of gas  i mean shell oil and everything 
it 's all right for a bachelor . 
caught him off cape hatteras . 
they shrink when they 're marinated . 
down the hatch  as we say at sea . 
water polo  is n't that terribly dangerous ? 
i 'll say .   i had two ponies drowned under me . 
not anymore .   i was in love once  but i 'd rather not talk about it .   how about a little cold pheasant ? 
oh no ! 
how can you think about food at a time like this ? 
have you ever tried american girls ? 
all right  if you insist . 
i 'm afraid not .   terribly sorry . 
look it 's terribly sweet of you to want to help out  but it 's no use .   i think the light switch is over there    and that 's the radio .   it 's like taking somebody to a concert when he 's tone deaf . 
eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars . 
yeah .  most important day of my life .  whatever .  listen i chose you to be my maid of honor for a lot of reasons i love you youre my favorite and only halfsister blah blah blah .  but the main reason i picked you is because youve been so miserable for the past few years i knew you wouldnt outshine me .   but here it is my big day .  my big day .  and something doesnt feel right .  maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night i dont know but your misery just isnt working for me anymore . 
still
im not as square as my daughter thinks . 
it was just after we moved here .  my little girls got in a fight over tony peepants and they havent made up since . 
i was pretty hard on her last night .   and now shes getting married . 
mom please . 
she did ? 
you are taking the piss ? 
other than hes shagging your exgirlfriend ? 
but somehow it was kats arse that was stung by nettles .  and you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf . 
oh shut up .  youre an optician . 
you yanks and your therapy .  its great .   its all a bit too touchyfeely for me . 
sorry can you give us a moment ? 
not for a dog . 
well we had a lot of good years but then .  .  . 
i slept with your sister . 
im compulsive and weird ? 
how does it feel to get that much money just for being you ? 
that wont be an issue believe me .  i find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant .   no offense . 
its okay .  hell ive never paid for it .  but please dont feel like you have to explain yourself to me . 
what ?  !  no no .  you cant
i have to .   im the best man . 
im so sorry . 
not exactly .  i wear it .   on my right hand .  and only rarely . 
yes ?  no .  what ?   save the patter for the tourists . 
hi kiddo . 
oh well then .  it probably wont work out . 
just drunk enough . 
close .  sydney .  turns out i missed the rain . 
i say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them . 
here you put your hand under the water and i 'll pump for you . 
that 's right
you could ?  how ? 
but where is my daddy !  ? 
yes miss johnson .  .  . 
 .  .  . the chance to soar in the dim blue air above smoke is to their .  .  . 
his visit with his father at the county jail house

yes sir  i learn to write a little bit and i can read a lot

into the clouds and behind the mountains . 
goodnight to you son .  .  .

it depends on the condition of the ship .   if i could get to one of the suit compartments i could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry .

it 's not an alley .  i hate when people call it a bowling alley it 's so common !  i prefer bowling center . 
if i find out buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling it 's lights out for him and pink slips for you .  sid and breeze look sideways at each other . 
what 's with the bad air between you two mr .  kastle ? 
he 's earned an early retirement .   but enough about losers buzz fazeli is history .  lets talk about your future .   i wanna show you something . 
there 's a lot of competition for amusement out there .  you gotta adapt to survive .

you professional men drive a hard bargain .  i 'm afraid i only have five on me .  sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill . 
you 're here .

but sir i do n't understand .   this report  these recommendations .  .  .  they 're for an encounter with extra terrestrial life . 
all i 'm saying is someone should keep an eye on him . 
i told you people nobody goes anywhere unless i say . 
i think i do . 
she put a razor to her wrists a day later . 
 i did n't know it would come to this

jerry ? 
ladies and gentlemen .  .  . 
duly noted ted .   edmunds try using suction . 
what if we go out there you know  wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open . 
to what ? 
well you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here .   in the ocean .   70 percent of the earth 's surface is water norman .   that 's first grade geography . 
it never occurred to me . 
well let 's pray that 's the only mistake you made .   have you said anything to barnes about this ? 
the timing has never seemed quite right . 
what  are you threatening me ? 
yeah .   drowning . 
wait a minute . 
yeah why ? 
in edmunds' things . 
calm down beth .   alright ? 
it 's done alright ?   it 's over !   and there 's not a damn thing we can do about it now okay ? 
wake him then .   let 's go .   get outta 
we ca n't .   the storm .   the waves would toss us around worse than we got down here .   and we have four days of decompression when we get up top . 
four days ? 
get the helium out of our bloodstream .   we go to the surface now we 'd pop like a soda bottle . 
why should i go ? 
in case you die too ? 
i ca n't see anything .   how does it look ?   still clear ? 
that was n't in there before . 
wait a second

antibiotic .

in the sub .   resetting the timer .  why ? 
i 'm a woman .   i do n't theorize .   i only deal with facts . 
for who ?   the fish ? 
yeah i do n't know how you could make that confusion . 
in time for what ? 
what ? 
wo n't make any difference .   the tapes document everything . 
no idea .   we have no surface support .  it transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater . 
fine .   i 'm fine . 
you sound defensive . 
i 'm fine . 
which one ?   let me get the list out . 
a sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible . 
meaning we 're never gonna get to the surface alive .  .  .  to tell anyone . 
look  we 're under a lot of pressure we 're tired you 're not thinking straight . 
then what norman ? 
what are you still doing here ? 
tell me about the door .   do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere ?  .  .  .  harry ?

thank you . 
it 's like showing leonardo da vinci a laptop computer .   he 'd run screaming witchcraft .   and you could n't explain it to him either .  modems microchips particle physics . 
the planet has been totally blown away !   it would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than i 've ever seen .  .  .  if the empire had a new weapon that could do this .  .  .  i would have heard something .  .  .  i 'd know about it . 
i 'm not afraid of anything .  .  . 
i assure you my intentions were n't bad . 
like bogan weather or bogan times .  i thought that was just a saying . 
but she 's a member of the twelve families .   how can they hold her ? 
these are doubtful times .   the empire has grown bold in its disregard of the .  .  . 
keep away i 'm fine i 'm fine . 
all you have to do is lose your thinking self .   do n't focus on anything .   let your body do your thinking .  .  .  you have to learn to act on what you feel not what you think  .  .  .  if i had the crystal it would be much easier .   you could feel the force immediately .  .  .  but for now let yourself go .   you 'll pick it up .  .  .  and someday you 'll have no need for that pistol either . 
yes sir but i can get him .  .  . 
should we alert the sith lords ? 
yes your highness .  i 'll let you open it then .   it wo n't be too long before they figure out what happened to us .   this has turned into a brilliant escape ! 
when artoo has been safely delivered to my forces you get your reward .  you have my guarantee . 
the plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system .  .  .  our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness which we will determine from the data i stored in artoo . 
where are you taking us now anyway ? 
i 'd better go see how he 's doing . 
i 'd like to get paid before that eventually .   i do n't plan to stick around for the fireworks . 
i do n't know .  .  .  i 've never fought anyone . 
i think i did . 
not if this tunnel deadends . 
get chewbacca .   try to get around it .  i 'll draw it away . 
the .  .  .  ah door 's jammed .   give us a few minutes to get it fixed . 
it 's too late .  .  .  we already tested it on organa major .   it appears your data never got through . 
it would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are .  .  .  otherwise we 'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system .  .  .  what a waste .  .  . 
what do i want with a scar  ? 
sir i know it was wrong .  i did n't learn from one mistake and i made another sir .   sir my family .  .  .  my whole family was in buenos aires sir .

elegant proof of intelligence is n't it  ?  we thought there might be a brain on p . 
did n't they tell you colonel  ?  that 's what cap troopres are good for . 
they revoke our flight status . 
oh i see .  .  .  teamwork . 
three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all huh  ?

you and me huh  ? 
it looks like an .  .  .  asteroid . 
is it true  ? 
your turn .  .  . 
aw c 'mon it 's just a bug . 
who cares about bugs  ?  you ca n't go anywhere if you do n't know math . 
then how come you wo n't hold hands with me at school  ? 
it 's not you johnny .  your parents are rich they do n't need to be citizens and that stuff means a lot to my dad .  he 's a veteran .

you 're the best . 
what 's your malfunction rico  ? 
nah i do n't do that anymore .  .  .

we 'll all have dinner .  i 'll fix your favorite . 
yeah  !  we 'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine  .  .  .  and .  .  .  well we love you son .

but i thought he came over to america before the war . 
well he did .  with his family .  but his cousins they had to stay and they were all killed .  and if he 'd stayed he would have been killed .  so in my book he 's a survivor . 
but that could 've happened to him .  or to me if i 'd been alive .  or you . 
great to be here .

i admit it  i was scared !  i was shocked in fact  by what he said .  and he 's so .  .  . convincing .  i 'm sorry if i let you down but really i still say he 's just one opinion .  i do n't even like his books that much .  they 're all so aggressively confrontational .  i do n't care if he 's won the pulitzer prize .

you ca n't think like that !   we 're watching them like a hawkhe 's bound to trip up make one false move
the ball is in richter 's court .   but we 're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates peoplewe 're gonna stop the sonof abitch ! 
what do you mean ? 
i assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it would n't be shelved in a lab somewhere .  .  . 
i have n't been briefed on any such thing ! 
what the hell is it anyhow ? 
i know what i 'm here foryou do n't need to remind me . 
excellent .  .  . excellent ! 
what are you so worked up about jack ?  fuck emwe do n't need em . 
you 're fucking crazy richteryou know that ? 
drop the anchor ! 
what does that mean ? 
the report is entirely untrue .   i can assure you of that . 
that 's nonsense and you know it ! 
oh yes that 's right . 
mister president are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this ? 
naturally .   it would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country .   but this way we know it 's safe and we do n't have the problem of delivering it . 
but that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt mister president . 
i do n't know sir .  we just spoke a few minutes ago . 
major that 's all i 've been told .   just got it on the red phone .   the base is to be sealed tight .   and i mean tight . 
yes sir .   i just thought of something sir .   how do i know i 'm talking to you now ? 
to you sir .   but how do i know ? 
thank you sir . 
yes sir . 
sort of like a new hobby huh general ? 
oh it 's not my radio sir .   i picked it up in the communications center . 
but  why .  .  . that would be an awful thing to do sir . 
perhaps major .   perhaps .   pour me a scotch and soda please .   and help yourself to whatever you like . 
just a squirt . 
i 've given it alot of thought major .   do n't think i have n't . 
but even then we would n't get everything .   i mean some missiles would abort or they 'd miss their targets or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we do n't know about . 
where sir ? 
if they gave us what we think we need yes i guess we would . 
and you 'd like to see that ? 
general what 's good enough for the president and all the experts he 's got working on the thing is good enough for me . 
major i happen to believe in a life after this one so i believe i will have to answer for what i have done .   i think i can . 
and i suppose there 's some reason why you have n't recalled them ? 
and i suppose you 're going to tell me you do n't know what the threeletter code is . 
how could you let this happen general schmuck ? 
they 're coming in now . 
how many planes did we lose ? 
he says they 've only shot down three planes . 
mister president there were thirtyfour aircraft involved .   thirty acknowledged the recall .   that makes four shot down . 
no they would n't send us in with bombs on an exercise . 
thanks binky .   can you see bromdingna island yet ? 
i do n't think so . 
he 's right .   they must have clobbered some of our cities already . 
what ? 
fortyfive .   still coming straight and fast .  twelve o' clock . 
between mach 3 and 4 . 
hang on boys . 
no kidding . 
i 've got one . 
well if they hit us first they 've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already .   we 'll just be hitting empty real estate . 
primary trigger switch . 
seond safety . 
but look here von klutz .   wo n't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked griefstricken and anguished that they will envy the dead and indeed not wish to go on living ? 
certainly not sir .   when they go down into the mine everyone else will still be alive .   they will have no shocking memories and the prevailing emotion should be one of a nostalgia for those
burger manifesto part one is gonna make people think ?

it 's from hunger . 
schaefer .   betty schaefer .   and right now i wish i could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me . 
i just think pictures should say a little something . 
goodbye mr .  gillis . 
exactly what kind of material do you recommend ?   james joyce ?  dostoosvsky ? 
about that luggage .   where 's the phone ? 
how about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door ? 
with a wildly beating heart . 
as a matter of fact .   i 've given up writing altogether . 
nobody can be that busy . 
and do n't make it too dreary .   how about this for a situation she teaches daytimes .   he teaches at night .   right ?   they do n't even know each other but they share the same room .   it 's cheaper that way .   as a matter of fact they sleep in the same bed  in shifts of oourse . 
i mean this is good dialogue along in here .   it 'll play . 
do n't you sometimes hate yourself ? 
second generation huh ? 
third .   grandma did stunt work for pearl white .   i come from a picture family .   naturally they took it for granted i was to become a great star .   so i had ten years of dramatic lessons diction dancing .  then the studio made a test .   well they did n't like my nose  it slanted this way a little .   i went to a doctor and had it fixed .   they made more tests and they were crazy about my nose  only they did n't like my acting . 
not once .   what 's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras ?  it 's really more fun . 
that 's it  there 's nothing like being twentytwo .   now may i suggest that if we 're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me  .  .  .   now back to the typewriter . 
something came up .   i do n't want to talk about it . 
why do n't you ?  we can finish the script by thursday . 
this is where you live ? 
i did n't come here to see a house .  what about norma desmond ? 
i 'm trying to tell you .   this is an enormous place .   eight master bedrooms .   a sunken tub in every bathroom .   there 's a bowling alley in the cellar .   it 's lonely here so she got herself a companion .  a very simple setup an older woman who is welltodo .   a younger man who is not doing too well  .  .  .  can you figure it out yourself ? 
all my things ?  all the eighteen suits all the custommade shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts and the cufflinks and the platinum key chains and the cigarette cases ? 
gordon cole ? 
it 's got a lot of good things .   of course it would be an expensive picture .  .  . 
i do n't care about the money .  i just want to work again .   you do n't know what it means to know that you want me . 
i am big .   it 's the pictures that got small . 
you are !  writing words words !  you 've made a rope of words and strangled this businessl but there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles and technicolor to photograph the red swollen tongue ! 
get out ! 
depends on what it is  a donald duck or joan or arc . 
and you 'll play salome ? 
i am not afraid .   read it ! 
this is fascinating . 
of course it is . 
oh no .   i could n't let it out of my house .   you 'll have to finish it here . 
just a scene i cut out . 
the one where you go to the slave market .   you can cut right to the scene where john the baptist 
not now my dear .   i 'm playing three no trump . 
ca n't you wait till i 'm dummy ? 

come here ! 
careful it 's slippery .   i had it waxed . 
you think this is all very funny . 
norma grow up .   you 're a woman of fifty .   there 's nothing tragic about being fifty  not unless you try to be twentyfive . 
i 'm the greatest star of them all . 
madame is waiting . 
there are no locks anywhere in this house . 
i lent it to a friend of mine .  he took it up to palm springs . 
had to get away for his health i suppose . 
no that was me .   i said who wants to see a civil war picture ? 
now wait a minute .   if we made it a girls' softball team put in a few numbers .   might make a cute musical it happened in the bull pen  the story of a woman . 
forget romanoff 's .   it 's the car i 'm talking about .   if i lose my car it 's like having my legs out off . 
yes madame . 
it is not mr .  demille in person .  it is someone by the name or gordon cole .   he says it 's very important . 
i myself was surprised at mr .  de mille 's manners . 
thank you max .

i 'll be safe with you .  we can stay together the rest of our lives . 
of course not but .  .  . there are things we do n't understand . 
it 's paradise  .  we could be very happy here . 
careful do n't make me angry .  i start fires when i 'm angry . 
that one was for you .  but i thought i 'd wait and see how you behave when supergirl gets here .  i 'd hate to lose you ethan .

from you ? 
did he say what about ?

that you did n't die ?   like the other children ? 
there 's no such thing as an accident nicole .   not in a situation like this . 
hard to say .   i might have .  .  . some business here . 
 .  .  . coming home drunk and i guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that .  .  . and .  .  . 
that 's good .   judges like adopted indian boys .   tell me more about the ottos .

seventytwo miles an hour .

i was a member of the communist party .  i was a communist .  that 's what hinkel had over me .  he knew everything .  he held that over me .  that 's how he made me cooperate . 
major we 're discussing a man of genius i do n't want .  .  .

we did it kyle .   we got it .

mrs .  dudley 'll be waiting for you . 
ca n't say .   have n't been here that long .   well it 's labor day gotta get to work . 
well i 've never lived with beauty .   you must love working here . 
my boyfriend thinks so my girlfriend does n't .   if we could all live together .  .  .  but .  .  .  they hate each other .   it 's hard to be miss perversity when you 're the only one at the party .   d 'you know what i mean ? 
i do n't have anyone .   but i do have a little apartment of my own .   it has a little flower garden .   you can just see the ocean .   at night when the wind comes in just right you can hear the buoys in the harbor . 
yes .   i 've missed it . 
david .

i do n't think i want any . 
it 's not a knock . 
oh god .

you steady on man .   what the fuck else did you do back there . 
that would be too easy . 
the lot .   the whole british bloody post office .   i had a brilliant plan  all worked out  work of genius it was .  could i get anybody interested ?   no  they 're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman .   lazy sods .   jumble sale on in watford they 'll be up at the crack of dawn .

not ashamed . 
how 'd you manage that then . 
no i had  some other matters to attend to you know .   getting a car sorted  .  .  . 
well i reckoned saturday night if you were goin' out you 'd probably have to come home first . 
nah accommodation address . 
what 's that like a p . o .  box . 
 mr .  lindgren . 
 when he wants someone run down you 're willing to do it for him . 
what do you think . 
it 's too involved a lifetime of non involvement .   anywhere else i 'd be an interesting little number here i 'm just sag number fortyeight thousand and one .   sag meaning screen actor 's guild . 
we were uluckyu to be nicked .   me and the lads went down there sunday evening we were n't discovered till the monday .   good job we were still breathing .

something 's on . 
you bet . 
you walked .   what the hell are you doing here . 
yeah .   i know her all right .   she came down here once stirred up a shitstorm .  we lost a full day 's work took me weeks to get back on schedule .   if she had n't a' been terry 's woman i would 've broke her jaw .   course she 's nobody 's problem now . 
since when ? 
please mr crane it 's ok please
well ?  how 'd she do ? 
then you listen to me for i am expert .  that girl she give me a headache .  she cannot play .  nice girl .  very clever hands .  nice girl .  someday i think maybe she make a very good typist . 
uh
jesus !  the barber !  i 'll be a sonofagun .  why did n't you say so ?  coursethe barber . 
come in come in siddown over there .  coffee ? 
sure . 
well i 'll be damned .  the barber !  and i thought this trip was a bust .  well .  .  . 
cash . 
and i 've never been askedlook you want the dough back ?  you know who i am !  you
could n't be better .  these 're boom times in retailing .  we 're opening another store big dave 's annex there on garson .  this is strictly haberdasherycasual wear pyjamas ladies' foundations and undergarments .  matter of fact i 'm thinking of making doris the comptroller .  how 're things at the uh the barbershop ? 
uhhuh . 
the sonofabitch .  the blackmailer .  it 's uh it 's no one you know .  it 's a businessman from sacramento .  a goddamn pansy ed .  he tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme i heard him out and then told him to go to hell .  and the very next day the very next day ed i get blackmailed for the same amount . 
that 's my capitalization on the annex !  my operation ed !  christ almighty .  that 's what i was just talking to doris about a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from ann . 
i 'm at nirdlinger 's .  let yourself in . 
no .  of course not .  she did n't do it . 
good !  that helps .  not that she did n't do it that she did n't confess .  of course there 's ways to deal with a confession but that 's good ! one less thing to think about .  now .  interview .  i 'm seeing her tomorrow .  you should be there .  three o 'clock .  one more thing you keep your mouth shut .  i get the lay of the land i tell you what to say .  no talking out of school .  what 's out of school ?  everything 's out of school .  i do the talking you keep your trap shut .  i 'm an attorney you 're a barber you do n't know anything .  understood ? 
 .  .  . ok . 
do n't interrupt methat 's means .  they got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim and then they got you a disgruntled numberjuggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home alone . 
yeah . 
bert 's ok sure he 's a good man .  i wo n't kid you though ed nobody around here has any experience with this kind of er .  .  .  and i hear they 're bringing a prosecutor up from sacramento .  capital offense .  taking it seriously .  .  .  hmm .  .  . 
no thanks honey . 
well there 's lloyd garroway in san francisco .  probityyou know no one ever said anything iffy about lloyd garroway .  conservative .  jury might like that .  might like that here . 
yeah . 
uhhuh . 
oh no .  that was written by mr ludwig van beethoven . 
sorry i just did n't remember . 
now being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a sodajerk there 's not much to it once you 've learned the basic moves .  for the kids there 's the butch or the heinie .  .  . 
no i mean it 's growing it 's part of us .  and we cut it off .  and throw it away . 
i 'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt . 
ok . 
you do n't got a headache ? 
the claws are sharp .  .  .  i must have cut myself .   better move these crates to the secure storage area where they 'll be safe . 
i 'll go down and speak to him . 
you have n't got the authority .   only pendergast can pull the plug . 
he 'll be back .   relax .   we 're in good shape .   your security is air tight .  there 've been no more incidents nothing suspicious .   there 's no reason to call off the opening now . 
do they have to wear uniforms ? 
behind you . 
i 'll do it .   just let me find my portable phone . 
just a minute .   i 'm shaking !   take the gun . 
that would leave one exit for hundreds of people .   you 'd be violating every fire regulation on the books .   we 'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells .   one more question .   i see a big hole .   if this entire thing is run by computer what happens if the power fails ? 
got my hands full here . 
dr .  john whittlesley . 
i do n't know .   i thought dr .  whittlesley died in south america . 
right .   the entire brain appears to have been extracted .   may i see it please ? 
the thalamus and the hypothalamus perhaps ? 
we ca n't do without you .   you 're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology .   you 're practically an institution around here . 
no margo .   this is one problem you ca n't solve .   you have to stay out of it .   the fact is i want to retire . 
let 's not jump to conclusions .   this egg could belong to any number of reptiles dr .  frock . 
that 's not so unusual .   many plants carry viruses .   like the burls on maple trees . 
but a virus normally codes for other viruses .   this one 's making human and animal proteins .   listen to this .   glycotetraglycine collagenoid .  weinstein's tropic hormone .   4 monoxytocin supressin hormone . 
and it 's hungry .   it 's been two days since it 's eaten .   there are five hundred people arriving right now .  the animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell !   all those people in one enclosed space .  .  . 
it 's like ringing the dinner bell . 
that thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes . 
no dr .  frock .   you ca n't . 
dear louis tomorrow we go to the south end of the tepui where we 'll be in the greatest danger so i 'm sending carlos back with the crates .   you always believed in me louis even in the darkest days .   so it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded .   we 've made an incredible find .   i enclose a representation of mbwun .   note the exaggerated claws the reptilian attributes the hints of bipedalia .  it 's beyond belief but this statue is accurate .   i know because i 've seen the beast . 
i do n't know .   it was walled over .   no one 's been down there in years . 
i do n't believe it . 
margo you have n't heard ? 
frock 's been fired . 
so what ? 
with a dna analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal whether it was nocturnal what it ate how it hunted how big it was .  .  .   you are n't here for a lesson in dna . 
maybe not . 
if he were alive he 'd have contacted me . 
yes .   once .   we met at columbia .   john held the cadwalader chair in statistical paleontology when i was a grad student there . 
how did you know that ? 
a monster ? 
my god .   then it was an animal . 
all right .   i 'm as macho as you are .  perhaps . 
all right .   this is hard for me .   i 'm a scientist .   i like order and logic .  sometimes too much .   there 's got to be an explanation .   there ca n't be an animal in there .   but i saw something . 
no .   a chromium alloy tipped  . 45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing 's skull like a spit ball .   i think it was bothered by my light . 
but this is n't the jungle !   this is new york .   how did it get here ?   a thing like that crossed two continents .   it makes no sense ! 
it 's scared of me . 
you have to !   listen !   all viruses pass on their own dna .   instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses !   this one was different .   it inserted a whole array of genes into john .   reptile genes sixty five million years old .   those genes remade him !   it 's not his fault ! 
do it quickly .   please .   aim for the eye . 
i ca n't ! 
viti levu .   for how many ? 
today . 
i do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for fiji tomorrow .   but you would n't want to do that . 
that 's right . 
and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role .   i really must congratulate you on writing kirk back in .   a master stroke . 
since kirk started this whole crisis in truman's life i came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it . 
but how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when truman sleeps ? 
we find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort .   have n't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep ? 
let me demonstrate some examples . 
ia show . i  then who am i ? 
why not ? 
i 'm truman truman burbank
i 'm sorry .   it 's not up to me . 
right now ?   we 've got finals tomorrow . 
what do i do ? 
i do n't know
you hate gambling . 
that 's right .   i do do n't i ? 
you blaming me for the traffic ? 
i think i 'd like a little company . 
what the hell are you talking about ?  ! 
i 've got something to tell you .   you 'd better sit down . 
i 'm telling you if it was n't him it was his twin .   did dad have a brother ? 
tell her tell her .  .  . i had to go to fiji .  i 'll call her when i get there . 
when you get to fiji ? 
they 're going to stop me talking to you . 
just listen .   you remember when you were a little boy you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like magellan
yeah . 
yup . 
why do n't you go home to the old lady 
are you going to let us in on what exactly you 're trying to prove 
 those are very serious allegations agent scully 
of what ? 
is it an emergency ? 
looking for him for what ? 
have you examined them ? 
show you right on a map . 
the federal building was too well guarded . 
not according to the men in blue . 
what is it ?  kiddie porn again ?  sexual battery of a patient ?  i 've had my license taken away in three states . 
how ? 
negotiating with whom ? 
something 's gone wrong  something unanticipated .  go back to dallas and dig .  or you 're only going to find out like the rest of the country agent mulder .  when it 's too late . 
i told you  he and i were old friends 
and why do you think it is you 're standing here talking to me ?  these people do n't make mistakes agent mulder . 
you 're looking for a bomb . 
i know that .  but the threat was called in for the federal building across the street . 
i think they have that covered . 
something i could n't show to anyone else .  not without more information .  and not without causing the kind of attention i 'd just as soon avoid right now .   the virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat i 've never seen before .  what it did to them it did extremely fast .  and unlike the aids virus or any other aggressive strain it survives very nicely outside the body . 
i 've got to be in washington d . c .  in eleven hours for a hearing  the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life .  and here i am standing out in the middle of nowhere texas chasing phantom tanker trucks . 
that bomb in dallas was allowed to go off to hide something bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself . 
what do you mean by haul ?   what are you not telling me here ? 
yeah .  .  .  ? 
i need you on this scully 
yes you can .  you 're going to make it scully . 
i do n't have his number . 
they can patch you in through the switchboard . 
 if it looks bad it 's bad for the fbi 
 if they want someone to blame they can blame me .  agent scully does n't deserve this . 
yes . 
and mulder ? 
shush . 
nothing . 
she said convincingly . 
really ?   i do n't work with violent cases i work with children .   but even a kid lies .   they love it when they get you to believe something that is n't true .   do n't you think stargher would do the same ? 
how hard could it be .  .  .  ? 
it does n't have much to do with science . 
that hoist with the winch .  .  . 
yep .   and guess who they hired to seal up the place ? 
i never kid .   my wife hates it .   says i 'm too serious . 
what 's wrong ? 
sit down . 
i 'm so sorry i did n't notice much . 
why do n't you leave this town  go home ? 
just another part i 've got to learn . 
ein hurigan  i guess . 
oh it 's very difficult .  you know harry .  .  . we did n't do .  .  . 
what 's the matter ? 
i do n't know . 
it was n't important . 
i was a friend of harry lime . 
where ? 
september '39 . 
what ? 
i 'm not interested in whether a racketeer like lime was killed by his friends or by accident .  the only important thing is that he 's dead . 
you 're not locking her up ? 
death is at the bottom of everything martins .  leave death to the professionals . 
in vienna .  .  . 
i would like a word with this orderly harbin . 
no . 
which side of the road ? 
i tell you i heard him running ahead of me . 
oh there you are .  come in here there is n't much time . 
i said you win . 
win what ? 
well look is there a car here i can use ? 
yes cultural reeducation section propaganda .  very important in a place like this .  we do a little show each week .  last week we did hamlet and the week before we had something .  .  . 
i 've heard of him of course but i did n't exactly know him . 
goodness that 's awkward . 
here ? 
what did he say ? 
how do you do . 
yes . 
i have guests waiting . 
hear the details . 
not necessarily . 
english ? 
who ? 
you remember me ?  upstairs .  .  . 
und ich kann nicht alle kennen . 
what does he say ? 
what 's he saying ? 
will we never teach these austrians to be good citizens .  it was his duty to give the evidence . 
not when i get interested . 
why no mr .  martins . 
his name ? 
i 'm daffy . 
i 'm sorry .  i ca n't lend you any money . 
just take it ok . 
look i do n't care about the money right now i just want some sleep .  so if you could be quiet 
thanks . 
of course but look all these people .  if that place existed they 'd all be there . 
nice work . 
i have no idea but it looks like a long way . 
i do n't know just a fin .  over there .  about a hundred meters . 
it was ridiculous all this at three o 'clock in the morning . 
i hope our noise did not keep you awake . 
why 'd we have to leave so fast ? 
let 's look at the fucking thing . 
the mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters .  they thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there with secret alternative meanings . 
fuck you .  i hate the jews at least as much as you do . 
no you do n't .  .  .  .  if you hated them you 'd study them so you 'd know why you hate them .  you know what tefillin is ?  tsitsis ?  shotness ?  you know the kaddish from the kiddush ?   eichmann ?  he went to israel .  he studied the torah the talmud the mishnah the whole bit .  he hated jews . 
yeah i read your piece .  it 's very smart .  and very wrong . 
nobody reads that stuff anymore . 
how come so many of the books are in spanish ? 
oh really ? 
that was a later invention it 's not in the scrolls .  .  .  .  anyway the jews know where the sentences end .  they know the whole thing by heart .  every word .  every letter . 
what do you care ? 
vayomer adonai el avram lech lecha mayartzcha oomimohladtcha oom 'bayt avaycha el haertez asher arecha .  .  . 
why ? 
christianity 's silly but at least there 's something to believe in .  or not believe .  judaism there 's nothing . 
kaddish is the prayer for the dead . 
i doubt it .  how did you find out ? 
he called me up .  he wanted to talk to me about my ideas . 
people hate jews .  do you agree ? 
but when it comes out the public will be outraged .  it will look like germany all over again . 
i 'm sure they are .  but what do we accomplish by pointing it out ? 
it 's the truth .  .  .  . 
what about mrs .  moebius and .  .  .  ? 
i 've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil hitler .  how am i supposed to  
curtis is a politician  and a bit of a hustler .  he 's not a thinker . 
real men  white christian men  we fuck a woman .  we make her come with our cocks .  but the jew does n't like to penetrate and thrust  he ca n't assert himself that directly  so he resorts to perversions .  oral sex is technically a perversion you know that do n't you ?   after a woman has been with a jewish man she never wants a normal partner again .  a normal man . 
do you know rabbi stanley nadelman ?  he used to be at congregation beth elohim in ozone park .  .  .  ? 
look at me .   do i look jewish ?   look .  .  . 
it 's too late .  .  .  .  if i did n't somebody else would .   yom kippur starts at sundown .  will you go to synagogue ? 
that does n't mean i do n't like hearing it . 
i ca n't help what i think . 
and only talked about killing manzetti to convince them you were an antisemite .  if you 'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously you never would have said it . 
think about your father .  your sister . 
danny i 'm trying to  save you . 
it 's german . 
i was going to ask you the same thing . 
who even knew ? 
so that 's what ?  nineteen thirty minutes .  .  . what time is it now .  .  . 
i 'm in the rabbinic program at jts .  .  . 
shut up .  .  . 
i do n't care what they are .  i know those people and i do n't like them .  the rest are just a bunch of kikes are n't they ? 
none whatsoever .  but i have to admit i 'm not terribly surprised . 
i think antisemitism today is largely a jewish phenomenon .  would n't you agree ? 
 .  .  .  maybe if jacques will let me fix up the place a little . 
well you 're going to have to tell him sometime ! 
of course . 
not yet .  .  .  i 'm waiting for the right moment . 
like a popsicle .   they 're keeping him on a stick until spring . 
what d 'you mean ? 
i tried him he ca n't go .   his son is being bar mitzvohed tomorrow .  .  .  i 'll go boss . 
italian is practically the same thing . 
remember when i went to italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium .   well we were n't being cheated by the mafia or anybody except maybe by me .  .  .    .  .  .  do they come for lunch everyday ?  i really went on my own business to see a man that i happen to be in love with .  .  .  and i 'm glad i did it but i 'm sorry about the policy and i 'll be happy to make up the money the company did n't get .  .  .  of course just now i do n't have .  .  .   one million four hundred and ten thousand dollars .   but if you were to dock my salary say twenty dollars a week in a few hundred years we 'd be even .  .  .  and i think this is where you fire me ? 
will that interfere with my getting maternity leave ?   i 'm pregnant . 
i think i 'll have a coffee . 
the mamma 's there too . 
yes the mamma is is there . 
no it 's the recipe for spaghetti frutti del mare .   you see i was right in getting you out here .   you 're a world champion my friend ! 
what are you doing here ? 
because you 'd laugh . 
he can learn .   he is learning . 
why ? 
how many are down there ? 
you 're going to hold me up at a time like this ? 
what does that mean ? 
yes . 
thank you thank you very much ! 
enzo do n't be angry .   i was lucky .  .  .  that 's all . 
jacques take me back down .  .  .  please . 
yeah .  .  .  sure .  .  .  is this your first trip to peru ? 
i thought it was a nice place .   is n't it ? 
i do n't know .  .  .  why ? 
you .  .  .  you would n't want to spend the day with me ? 
uncle louis .   he 's a 75 year old amazing guy is n't he ? 
because you have to find a good reason to come back up again .  .  .  and i always have a hard time finding one . 
uncle louis this is my friend johana . 
johana .  .  .  new york . 
again ? 
what ? 
okay .  .  .  who 'd you meet ? 
my name is esther .  chief bloomenbergensteinenthal from the jewish defense league desperately needs to speak with you . 
mordechai santa claus has been rubbed out by his son damian .  the man's a demon .  there 's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho santa is capable of . 
sure .  why not . 
oh ! 
no .  it 's not like that .  you 're being completely neurotic .  i was just playing along .  .  . 
i 'm sorry esther i just do n't think we can see each other romantically anymore . 
no .  no .  we 're gonna argue .  and you know what mom ?  i 'm going to save hanukkah just to spite you .  and when my face is all over the television .  when your friends are opening their hanukkah gifts next year do n't mention it to them okay ?  i would n't want you to have to show my picture . 
 .  .  . so you saved hanukkah mr .  big shot .  i mean let 's be honest mordechai it is n't even one of the high holidays . 
 .  .  . i 'm not finished yet mom . 
yeah i 'm going to be out of the office from 130 to 300 on sunday .  i have a terrible yeast infection and i need to see my gynecologist . 
not if i can help it .  you got any information for me ? 
okay look .  i 'm going to work really really hard on this one .  but please stop with the pressure .  i 'm already tense as it is . 
now this might get a bit technical but try and stay with me .  using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators called the internet i can access surveillance maps villian biographical information and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter . 
oh yeah .  take a look . 
while i was in taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems i came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive jewish pride weakening substance on the planet .  i bought the entire plant . 
oh that 's the beauty of it .  these are free samples . 
resting ? 
that depends .  how much money has he ? 
drink your beer and do n't get so excited . 
let me see it 
you must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father 's grave .  .  . 
yes .  so i 've noticed .  jerry 's noticed  he 'll come up with something . 
oh that 's so interesting ! 
well now that you 've had your history lesson i think i 'll get on to the museum . 
do n't feel so concerned jerry . 
charlie likes his leopard . 
some crazy guy . 
no .  he would be a hard man to find jerry .  particularly if he were a clever men .  he would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him . 
i did n't want to kill but i had to .  i heard her in the cemetery  talking to the man in the auto 
it 's not for me .   i 'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot . 
something 's wrong with this whole setup 
makes no difference .   get him out . 
i thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act . 
do n't be soft . 
yes . 
maybe i want to feel badly . 
you .  us . 
maybe there ought to be less racket and more us . 
you 're positive of that are n't you ? 
absolutely sure . 
all right i 'm not ashamed of it !  i split it two ways 
half to the delgado family and half to cloclo 's family . 
i know  teresa 
nobody ?  huh !  .  .  .  how come ? 
uh .  .  .  wait a moment mrs de moraes .  .  . 
why dont you ask when i left the mondrian ? 
i .  .  .  if you dont mind i do not think he matters now .  it .  .  .  things turned out to be as we thought leon was weak .  theres no point in delving into his sad life anymore .  now will you please tell me how much we owe you ? 
no ! 
leon hung himself .  .  . 
not in the strict sense of the word no .  he was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when i caught up with him later . 
where is that ? 
simplify and damn . 
dont you believe in simplicity ? 
no .  not us .  .  . 
i dont know .  everyones dead .  .  .

whats a french private investigator doing here ? 
im afraid i dont understand . 
theyre german jews .  came here before the war .  they both lost all their families in extermination camps but they themselves never went near one .  the idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting leon .  its not guilt more of a curse .  .  .   and then theres something about his parents being involved with nazi hunters .  .  .  but i think thats just one of leons dark delusions .  .  . 
do you know leons parents names ? 
 .  .  .  no . 
you sure ?  what about before he turned up with the boy ? 
good .  you neednt worry about the austrian anymore .  hes dead .  ill be in touch . 
i hear youre looking for leon .   that makes me his oldlady and now you looking for the little bastard .  leons gone man .  vanished .  you interested in his photographs ? 
what about his girlfriend ? 
yeah !  somewhere in wales .  i dont really know her .  used to turn up in a transit van on weekends sell old furniture at camden .  thats how come he only laid her at weekends ha ha .  .  . 
gluck . 
so why didnt he ? 
not even scum like friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call . 
shut up and walk .  .  . 
i dont know .  could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor huh ? 
of course i am it 's just that .  .  . 
yes my lord . 
jean it 's .  .  .  it 's not so easy .  .  . 
jean .  .  .  me dear loyal jean .  .  .  why do you want to oppose the will of god ?   jeanne wanted to go to compiegne  we let her  she got caught .   then on my personal orders regnault proposed 30000 crowns for her ransom and once again the answer was no .   and now you say she tried to escape and the answer is still no .   jean open your eyes  ca n't you see the hand of god in all this ? 
well .  .  . 
it 's over jeanne .   we won just as you said ! 
the truth is always simple .  .  .  it 's you jean who 's making things complicated . 
to be killed in battle ? 
i want to stay with you .  .  . 
i 'll be right here .  .  .  i promise . 
i will hear you .  .  .  but not now not here . 
pierre cauchon bishop of beauvais .  as you were captured in my diocese the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me . 
the english ?  ? 
not unless you hear my confession . 
these questions have nothing to do with your trial . 
last night . 
yes . 
he 's feeling wonderful . 
buying her ? 
who better than a messenger from god to give answers to your questions ? 
for the sake of france charles .  and for the sake of my grandson . 
i assure you charles the maiden has no greater admirer than myself .  but whatever our personal feelings we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war .   for the sake of the kingdom it is imperative that you stop her going to compiegne .  .  . 
supposing she 's an assassin ? 
no doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause  but what about the ordinary soldier ?   they do n't fight for causes these days .  they fight for money .   who 's going to pay them ? 
his face . 
it is all his majesty can afford .  he has even donated his very own personal savings .   his majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families . 
may i without offending you inquire how generous ? 
good .   where are the english ? 
everywhere .   where is the food ? 
it 's coming  i rode on ahead .   i have to speak with the captain of the english army .  .  .  his name 's talbot .  .  . 
because if they do n't i 'll raise such a warcry against them that they will remember us forever ! 
well .   i 'd love to see that but after taking counsel with my captains i felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city then wait till alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything . 
jeanne you have to understand  it 's not easy for us  i mean for our pride  to suddenly be usurped by a  well with all due respect by a .  .  .  girl . 
the wind will be against us .  .  . 
the dauphin  he 's sending us food  and supplies  and an army  led by jeanne  the maiden from lorraine  is n't it wonderful ?  ! 
and it 's not the first one !   they say she saved a little boy who was dying of .  .  . 
never look behind  only ahead ! 
do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin ?   no one is allowed to destroy the life that god created ! 
then lord dunois show me the way to the other side of the river .  .  . 
they will  and so will you if you go on swearing like that . 
they 're going to come and visit you in here ? 
no no  you ca n't stay or they wo n't come ! 
what signs ? 
no i do not think so .   i do n't think that killing each other will ever bring peace . 
are you willing to follow all his commandments ? 
 .  .  .  to love your enemy as much as you love yourself ? 
so .  .  .  alright .   what terrible sin have you committed since then that ca n't wait till tomorrow to be forgiven ? 
they were n't my shoes .   mine were too small . 
i 'm sure he 'll forgive you . 
yes it is . 
then .  .  .  why are you here so often ? 
then what will ?   and what will bring her back ?   and why did she have to die in the first place instead of me ?   why did n't he take my life instead of hers ?   it was my fault  i was late  she gave me her hiding place .  .  .  !  ! 
oh yes .  i remember . 
really ? 
that 's what i said it 's so  it 's too absurd ! 
what are you doing ? 
does n't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves ?  where will we get them ? 
can you help ? 
your work yes playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto they do n't give a damn about people 's sufferings they do n't even notice what 's going on around them !

i do n't think you will .   it 's your father 's . 
how did you ever remember me ? 
probably not . 
i hate all that fuss .   but i 'll do it on one condition  that you 're there to give me away . 
a new invention ? 
we were planning to be married right after christmas . 
only in bad weather . 
i hope you wo n't talk that way to the police when they come here . 
what 's that to you ? 
i 'm asking you . 
keep on asking . 
so you say   go on bob . 
who 's is it ? 
it 's a bargain then .   anything you want to know ? 
they 're all o . k .   mrs .  jorgensen the boy dorothy macaulay .  .  .  even morelli .  .  .  we had to let him go . 
what about jorgensen ? 
he 's holding out on you . 
because i found out for certain that he did n't commit the murders . 
i was n't in .   my secretary took the message .   he left word for me to meet him at the plaza . 
when was that ? 
you say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it til we came ? 
did you see anything in miss wolfe 's hand ? 
a brown suit brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red or reddish brown figures on it . 
i do n't mind telling you i 'd rather have you working with us than against us . 
you 're a great help to a hostess .  i wish i always had you for my dinner parties . 
is julia going with you ? 
slim . 
hello .  .  .  .   where ?   in allentown .   yes .  .  .  when is the next train ?  right  i 'll get that .   wynant 's tried to commit suicide .  they want me to come down and identify him .   i guess this changes the whole story does n't it ?   that looks like an admission of guilt .   and i had such hopes .   i thought if you got on the case you 'd be able to clear him .   i thought that mimi .  .  .  .  the way she acted .  .  .  i was sure that .  .  .  .   oh well well .  .  .  it 's no use thinking of it now .   i 'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time . 
that 's not for you to decide .  everybody 's under suspicion  especially running off like this   the police will want his description .   is this a picture of him ? 
last night .   he came to see me at my apartment . 
it is n't a story  it 's true .   i did see wynant .   he 's not dead . 
he 's welltrained .   he 'll behave himself . 
what are you drinking ? 
maybe a drink would help you . 
maybe it would if i took it . 
darling my guess is that wynant killed julia and dorothy knows it .  and the police 'll catch him without my help . 
he 's got more sense than you have .  thank heaven you 're not on this case . 
yes .   i know all they know about the murder .  and i 'm a great hero .  the tribune said i was shot twice . 
yes . 
what 's the matter with you ? 
i do n't believe he did it . 
go on  go on  see if i care .  but it 's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to new york just to make me a widow . 
you bet i would n't . 
do n't say it that way .  say it as if you meant it . 
that 's a fact . 
several things .   hello fred .   we 're hungry again .  yeah and lots of onions .   oh and coffee . 
what things made you so sure ? 
no .   nobody but you . 
what are you going to do ? 
thank you mrs .  charles . 
i wish you 'd tell me who . 
i hope you 're well . 
honest mr charles .   i never touched that safe .   them bonds that were missing .  .  .  julia took them . 
bonds sir ? 
maybe miss wolf has them . 
maybe she has . 
oh yes  yes  that 's right  
not much chance of that .   jaeger 's an idiot . 
maybe that 's all the iraqis could afford okay ?   maybe they got it on discount .  maybe the fuse is messed up .   or maybe it 's going to go off in two seconds and we wo n't have to worry about getting jaeger down off there all we 'll have to worry about is finding the pieces . 
yeah . 
probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here .   worn down to nothing now . 
basically .   but the map has been pretty precise so far .   i do n't think it 'll be too hard to
weird they did n't chase us . 
what about the gold ? 
why 'd he come in our camp . 
he 's an enemy soldier . 
i 've got no stomach for murder . 
get out of my way . 
so you can give us away ? 
it 's like i said you do n't really know lieutenant john epps very well do you ? 
no you 're not . 
blow me .   have i said that to you guys recently ?   blow me . 
i did it !   i got the box open . 
cool it jaeger .   hey wes ?   wes ? 
yeah .   i meant .  .  .  you know what i 'm going to do with it ?   i 'm going to buy a sixty three vette stingray .   all tricked out and cherry .   i 'm going to be so sweet . 
what are you going to do with your uthirdu ? 
if they land we can take them .   if they do n't land then we 've got nothing to worry about . 
get up off your ass and dig ! 
i feel air .   probably opens up outside somewhere .   that 's where the light comes from .   could n't see it with the lanternon . 
what ? 
how !  ? 
what do you mean no ?   they can fly us home . 
they must be saudis .   it 's a saudi checkpoint .   oh sweet jesus .   come on .  come on ! 
i .  .  . i never killed anyone before .   i told you that . 
what if it had n't been wes ?   what if .  .  . i mean accidently what if i had .  .  . 
why do i have to lie in the road ? 
how the hell should i know ? 
hey jaeger .   what 's up . 
i 'm looking for a favor .   i need a map of iraqi . 
yeah a headache .   my head hurts .   you 're making me uncomfortable . 
yeah you 're funny . 
what ? 
yeah .   so ? 
come on man .   i almost had this thing open . 
this is so weird .   it 's happening but it 's not .   it 's like a tv show and we 're part of it .

wyatt what 're you talkin' about ? 
you know nothing .   what you do n't know would fill a book .   jesus i feel like it 's when you 're around i need it most .   you 're never yourself you never relax .   never .  everything 's so stiff and dead .  you always have to keep a rein on everything ever yourself .   oh you smile sometimes i 've even seen you laugh .   but there 's no light in your smile for me wyatt nothing to keep me warm .  and i get cold wyatt .   i get so cold .   what 's between you and that jew woman ?

curly bill huh ?   who was that other idiot ? 
what do they say in russia general bukharin ?  
take the girl .  leave the handcuffs .  we 'll drown her at sea . 
did you test the autopilots ?  the satellite positioning receiver ? 
him ?  he is a she   at the bar . 
i do n't care who you dial so long as it 's not me .  next 
yes .  the famous james bond .  i 've heard all about you sir .  you were under direct orders to act as an observer  and yet you had to go off on your own like some halfassed cia cowboy   endangering the gold attracting that lunatic woman and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide . 
 .  .  . that 's all well and good captain save for one thing  there 's no gold down there . 
it 's on the boat .  he 's holding a press conference tomorrow . 
occasionally yes .   british media mogul .  born in hong kong controls newspapers tv radio cable satellites books magazines movies computer software .  theme parks . 
need i remind the two of you that elliot harmsway  sir elliot harmsway  is directly descended from the earl of aberdeen ?  that his scottish ancestors practically invented hong kong  and out of sheer gratitude queen victoria herself named the port aberdeen harbor in their honor ? 
q 's retirement party .  i 'd just put the knife into the cake and 
fishing ? 
big game fishing .   sonar torpedoes .  retirement gift from his friends at the cia . 
plastique explosive shoelaces .   cut them to regulate the size of the blast totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe . 
perfect way to tie up a .  .  .  knotty' problem ? 
hey  the world is my office . 
he tied one on . 
of course . 
depends what number you write . 
have we met ? 
nice to run into you again . 
you have to excuse miss winch she thinks she 's on a seduce and destroy' mission through life .  .  .    .  .  . but she wo n't kill us . 
 the family jewels ? 
elliot harmsway is my uncle ! 
he was my father 's best friend ! 
and number two ? 
and when might that be ? 
yes 
chew up a log like that in the propeller you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to london .  twice . 
 .  .  . i see . 
thank you uncle elliot . 
no matter what the british government says i wo n't kill this story .   miss oxford will show both of you to the elevator .  .  .  and one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later . 
you come with me   you stay here . 
it 's bond ! 
 .  .  . have n't we already paid him for his services ? 
no sir !  i swear !  this is not true !  ! 
you disappoint me number three . 
i do n't know .  he 's not in the database 
no it 's that when do you have time to be parents to him ?  you guys do n't pick him up until nine ten at night .  you are into yourselves as the saying goes .  spend some time trying to be parents .  take him to the mountains fishing .  you ought to let him get to know nature . 
oh here we go with that . 
you always got the best of it around here and when dad always talks about my son it is always you so you fix the roof . 
my daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it .  every summer the way they kept me and junior out of trouble was to send us to big daddy 's farm .  we would get up with the chickens .  every summer the fence had to be repaired .  the barn needed a coat of paint .  we had to pip all of big mama 's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on sunday .  for big daddy calluses and sweat were the mark of a man .  sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did . 
how old are you ? 
i guess it proves you really care about me .  you hung in there . 
this does n't make any sense you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air . 
we grow most of our own food .  the money i get from social security my pension and my wife 's work keeps us living on the edge .  what choice do people like us have . 
do n't bother the poor boy .  it just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are . 
i asked you to wake me when babe brother comes . 
it would be nice . 
you better be careful .  you 'll get a stroke arguing . 
i 'm glad you brought that up as to who you are .  i have to know who is in my house . 
miss clara 's boy emory to start with .  the johnson's hocker was another one .  .  . 
you know as well as i do that it was made to look like he was lynched .  now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree ? 
i was quoting from the bible .  if the shoe fits wear it . 
i thought you were n't old fashioned . 
no .  no .  no .  no .  i had my child at cedars and sinai .  and that ai n't no county hospital .  you have to have cash or check before you come in the door . 
i remember harry always trying to help someone .  he got lulla 's daughter out of trouble .  he was always running to the store for someone who could n't leave the house . 
rush your mouth girl .  no he did n't .  he cannot be that big of a damn fool . 
well sure we can leave it up . 
oh yeah ! 
you can bring one toy .  .  . 
well honey just grab some other toy !   now c 'mon ! 
honey i 'm sure he 's around .  you 'll find him . 
but what if we leave them behind ? 
i know andy 's excited about buzz but you know he 'll always have a special place for you . 
i need to repair my turbo boosters .  do you people still use fossil fuels or have you discovered crystalic fusion ? 
i tell you i could fly around this room with my eyes closed ! 
that was n't flying !   that was falling with style ! 
you 're mocking me are n't you ? 
then we 've no time to lose !  ! 
oh .   oh that 's good . 
well then let 's climb abroad . 
alright buzz get ready .  .  . 
you are the one that decided to climb into this 
pardon me .   i hate to break up the staff meeting but they 're here !  birthday guests at three o 'clock !

i got dibs on his hat ! 
outta my way !   here i come here i come

nothing . 
i was close to being scared that time . 
hey woody !  ?   where 'd ya go ? 
sir !   no sir ! 
it 's a big one .  .  . it 's a .  .  . it 's a boardgame !   repeat !   battleship  battleship the boardgame ! 
juvenile intrusion !   repeat !  resume your positions now ! 
it 's busted . 
that 's right .   your toys . 
not now slink .   i 've got some bad news . 
but you 're irish ! 
can you move over a wee bit ? 
finn  .  .  . 
what difference does ithati make ? 
sixteen .  well nearly sixteen . 
i mean did you ask her ?   what kind of drugs has she tried ? 
i want to believe you .   i really do . 
of course he is .   i 've known him for twenty years and he does n't jaywalk .  .  . 
you 're gonna get through it but the first thing we do is get michael adler to represent carl .   we get adler and we beat this thing . 
that 's frustrating . 
it 's so frustrating . 
i think she has to find out for herself on her own .   we have to allow her space 
yeah well she has a way of self medicating that probably seems familiar too . 
no not yet . 
how well do you know this boy seth who was driving ?   you know the police have charged him with a dui and possession of marijuana . 
how 's david ?  how 's david ?  he 's terrific carl . 
helena 
somehow i do n't see that happening . 
will we get invited to the white house ? 
not like .   it is . 
have you done your homework honey ? 
yes mom 
i have dreams about this actual dreams about busting the top people the rich people the white people .

yeah . 
yeah .   it should be fun .   you wanna come ? 
go home .   get cleaned up .   get to work .   salazar is heading down to mexico city next week and i 'm not getting left behind .   do n't fuck this up . 
what ? 
so .  .  .  maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations . 
everybody has a weakness . 
i 'm aware of that . 
we kidnapped noriega out of panama .  is that covered in your constitution ?  because it is n't in mine . 
that triple the amount of stuff is going through . 
i want your money i 'll take your money . 
we sometimes went downtown to score . 
you do n't know what the hell you 're talking about .   you 're a cocky seventeen yearold and you do n't have a clue what the stakes are .  you do n't know the value of the life you 've yet to throw away .   and neither does she . 
i mean who runs interdiction on the mexico side ? 
he 's a research doctor .   you 're dad 's a doctor too 
what kind of research ? 
well i 've not brought them . 
i 'm sorry . 
because i fucking told you to do that you doss cunt . 
did you bring the cards ? 
i 'm going home . 
right .  you ca n't sleep here . 
and do n't make any noise . 
because it 's illegal . 
yes . 
i 've got a boyfriend mark . 
actually it 's a nightmare .  i 've been desperate for a shag but watching him suffer was just too much fun .  you should try it with tommy . 
what was it pneumonia or cancer ? 
oh yes indeed .  i look back on my time there with great fondness and affection .  the debating society the first eleven the soft know of willow on leather 
four grand . 
sorry boys i do n't have two thousand pounds . 
the sick boy method . 
that 's hardly a substitute . 
to see you through the night that lies ahead . 
as you wish . 
sure . 
sure will pal sure will . 
it 's really nice tommy .  can we go home now ? 
it 's fresh air . 
six weeks and no sex ? 
a walk . 
but where ? 
and how did you breach the barrier ? 
then i shall make use of this starship . 
it will be your chariot ! 
it runs deep .  share it with me . 
return to prearranged coordinates for pickup . 
all right we 're lost .   but we 're making good time . 
pavel . 
a federation starship . 
your threats amuse me captain chekov .  what consequences did you have in mind ? 
jim .  .  .  ?  well we 're dressing informally are n't we ? 
then we 'll have to get them out the old fashioned way . 
beam up spock and dr .  mccoy .  now ! 
mm .  ? 
i believe dr mccoy is not in the best of moods . 
are we leaving captain ? 
i was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words . 
spock we 're on leave .  you can call me jim . 
the knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by vulcan belief . 
he believed the key to selfknowledge was emotion not logic . 
be one with the horse . 
if you think it would help . 
look the man may be a fellow vulcan but that does n't .  .  . 
in order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible we 're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually . 
what you fear is the unknown .  the people of your planet once believed their world was flat .  columbus proved it was round .  they said the sound barrier could never be broken .  it was broken .  they said warp speed could not be achieved .  the great barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear .  it 's an extension of personal fear .   captain kirk i so much want your understanding .  i want your respect .  are you afraid to hear me out ? 


sybok you are my brother but you do not know me .  i am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago .  since that time i have found myself and my place .  i know who i am .  and i cannot go with you . 
this is my doing .  this is my arrogance .  .  .  my vanity .  .  . 
tried to .   ca n't quite make the connection with that sucker though .  if i had a direct terminal  .  .  . 
because somewhere .  .  .  in one of those memories  .  .  .  is the evidence .  if i got in far enough i could reconstruct it . 
you call that getting over it ? 
uh no  .  .  .  i mean not that often 
boy i sit up there grindin' away all day and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun . 
yes .  .  . but you have to go roundtrip and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance .  hah ! 
yesssss .  yes .  yes .  yes . 
oui da yessiree sure nuff you betcha . 
no .  .  . 
yes okay exactement ! 
let 's get outta here .

you would n't dare . 
hah . 
no .  .  .  tron  .  .  .  must .  .  .  destroy mcp .  .  .  first .  .  . 
you know anybody that 's got an army for rent that 's fine .  .  . but my uh user said to go take that sucker out .  an' let 's face it the big ox is n't gonna get any weaker .  i feel like hittin' him now while i 'm good an' mad .  some nerve .  .  .  what does he care whether you guys get killed long as he keeps rakin' in quarters ? 
well  that 's how it is for programs yes but 
yes . 
how about you ? 
not much chance of that now .  the mcp can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it .  .  . 
that 's right .  he pushed me .  .  . in the other world .  somebody pushes me i push back .  so i brought him down here  .  .  .  what 's the matter sark ?  you look nervous . 
i have to find out what alan wants .  .  .  that comes first . 
oh tron .  .  .  i knew you 'd escape .  .  .  they 've never built circuit that could hold you .  .  . 
that 's all going to change yori .  .  . 
it 's a flat .  but wait a micro .  .  . 
so i guess you did n't get away for the weekend after all ? 
are you kidding ?   harry had to go out of town .

okay . 
it 's not okay .   it 's extortion . 
good thinking honey . 
well i pull out the manual on their setup which is the new 680 server .  .  . 
it sounds wild .   so now you 're a big hero right ?   for fixing their system . 
i needed to feel alive .   i wanted to do something .  .  .   outrageous .  and .  .  .  i do n't know .  .  .  it felt good to be needed .   to be trusted .   to be special . 
my husband ca n't know about this . 
what ?   oh the flat tire ?   yeah i thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there . 
sure hon . 
i do n't take those assignments . 
wait here .   if you have to use this use it .   do n't choke .  okay ? 
and you 've got one . 
it 's killer .   look at me i 'm not that much to look at .   no really .   i can be honest .   but i got em lining up and not just skanks either .   some are . 
use em and lose em . 
some kinda legal secretary of something .   married to some boring jerk . 
hey slow down you 're gonna miss the turn ! 
you son of a bitch .   did you really think you could elude us forever carlos ? 
no .   soon as i turn you 'll shoot me . 
uh .  .  .  well okay then .   you sound terrible .   i 'll run out right now .   just call the prescription in to the pharmacy .   sure no problem .   bye . 
i 'm helen tasker .   harry 's my husband .   and you are ? 
okay .   it 's just things are a bit hot for me right now .   if i get a signal .  .  .   i may have to leave suddenly . 
you recognized my style .   see you 're very good .   you 're a natural at this . 
you can trust me completely . 
it 's strange .   i knew i was in a woman's thoughts when i was shooting it out with those assassins . 
and you chased one ? 
you 'll call me then ? 
it 's serious .   that 's all i can say .   just meet on k street under the key bridge .   at eight sharp . 
thanks a lot . 
i took a cab . 
i suppose you gotta get up early huh ? 
do you have a fella ? 
how long have you worked here ? 
yeah she od 'd .  but was n't on her last legs or anythin' .  she did n't take too much .  it should n't have killed her .  there was somethin' wrong with what she took . 
did you hurt yourself ?   whatd 'ya do ?  step on a thumbtack ? 
heroes for sale ? 
is he nice ? 
at the bus station .  he said i 'd be a perfect call girl .  and that he knew an agency in california that on his recommendation would handle me .  they have a very exclusive clientele movie stars big businessmen total whitecollar .  and all the girls in the agency get a grand a night .  at least five hundred .  they drive porsches live in condos have stockbrokers carry beepers you know like nancy allen in dressed to kill .  and when i was ready he 'd call em give me a plane ticket and send me on my way .  he says he makes a nice finder 's fee for finding them hot prospects .  but no one 's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who does n't know whether to shit or wind her watch .  so what i 'm doin' for drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes .  it seemed like a lotta fun but i do n't really like it much till last night .  you were only my third trick but you did n't feel like a trick .  since it was a secret i just pretended i was on a date .  an um i guess i want a second date . 
no clarence .  just forget it babe .  i just wanna disappear from there . 
you do n't know me .  not when it comes to shit like this .  i have to do this .  i need for you to know you can count on me to protect you .  now write down the address . 
what ? 
nope .  i 'm not really a wine gal . 
i been in america all my life .  i 'm due for a change .  i wanna see what tv in other countries is like .  besides it 's more dramatic .  where should we fly off to my little turtledove ? 
killin' em 's the hard part .  gettin' away with it 's the easy part .  whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp 's killed ?  burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it ?  they could n't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head .  if you do n't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand you got away with it . 
all anybody saw was clint eastwood drinkin' coffee . 
she 's with me . 
who the fuck are you ? 
i 'm her husband . 
well .  that makes us practically related .  bring your ass on in . 
ask him if he got the letter . 
i 'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand .  how difficult can that be ? 
he 's nothing .  he 's in my acting class .  but he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named lee donowitz .  i thought donowitz could be interested in a deal like this .  he could use it .  he could afford it . 
elliot what ? 
two guys . 
let me handle this . 
me too boris . 
get a sixpack of something imported .  it 's hard to tell you what to get cause different places have different things .  if they got fosters get that if not ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has .  look since you 're making a beer run would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well .  i 'm fuckin' starvin' to death .  are you hungry too ? 
you were a cop . 
if you do n't hang around in this circle no reason it should . 
i give up .  who are you ? 
i 've heard of blue lou boyle . 
mcteague . 
you and robin moved ? 
and just think when you get out in a few years you 'll meet some girl get married and you 'll be so understanding to your wife 's needs because you 'll know what it 's like to be a woman . 
krinkle you 're lookin' at the two future cops of the month .  we have it and if i say we i do n't mean me and him i 'm referring to the whole department .  have n't had a decent bust this whole month .  well we mighta come in like a lamb but we 're goin' out like a lion 
so we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin' .  and krinkle you ai n't gonna fuckin' believe it . 
we have to show in court that without a doubt a successful man an important figure in the hollywood community is also dealing cocaine . 
whatta we gonna do ?  he 's in an elevator . 
this guy 's gonna kill him . 
you 're an actor so act motherfucker . 
naw man it ai n't white boy day . 
i 'm tryin' to find my jacket .

if it came down to who eats who damn skippy . 
i 'm not wearing a bra .

i did n't mean 
for a man in your position .  .  . an opportunity . 
cole did you or did you not record that message ? 
you 're still a little .  .  .  disoriented . 
i need to go . 
what 's wonderful about the air james ? 
why do you think there are n't any germs in the air james ? 
i have the .  .  . strangest feeling i 've met you before .  .  . a long time ago perhaps .  were you ever .  .  .  ? 
no more drugs .   please .  .  . 
we 're avoiding the police until i can .  .  .  . talk to you . 
i think i saw a tv show like that when i was a kid .   where a boy .  .  . 
i .  .  . i .  .  . we need cash james . 
i have seen it but i do n't remember this part .   funny it 's like what 's happening to us like the past .   the movie never changes  it ca n't change  but everytime you see it it seems to be different because you 're different  you notice different things . 
wooooo they really dosed you bro .  major load !   listen up  try and get it together .   focus !   focus !   the plan !  remember ?   i did my part . 
and that 's when i told you my father was this famous virologist and you said hey he could make a germ and we could steal it ! 
cole !   oh god cole where are we ? 
i did n't think i was being defensive .  i was just .  .  . 
for god sakes owen listen to me  he knew about the boy in fresno and he says three billion people are going to die ! 
no !   absolutely not .  do n't tell me anything . 
your psychiatrist ?   did you just say your psychiatrist ? 
james cole .   that 's everything we got .   none of the james coles on the computer match him .  no license no prints no warrants .   nothing .  you want me to go in with you ? 
what the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for ? 
or maybe you just think you do .   you can run just as far as you can but wherever you go there you are . 
things ai n't always the way they seem .  you got to ask yourself is it worth it ? 
nothing . 
you want to make a kiddies bet ? 
you got to be more careful .   i remember one time
what 's that got to do with the radiator hose ? 
i do n't know but it 's the reason i 'm living here and you 're just passing through .   now you owe me a hundredfifty dollars . 
listen man .   i got rolled half and hour ago for everything i had . 
you son of a bitch ! 
sweet talk me all you want i still want my hundredfortyfive dollars . 
who the hell is this !  ? 
wrong number . 
i picked them out for you jake .   i thought you would like the colors . 
that 's right on my way . 
my cup runneth over beauti
it 's grace . 
you sure you can manage ? 
i saw these in the penny 's catalog and i just knew i had to have them .  you ever seen something and just knew you had to have it ? 
'course they cost a little more than i should really be spending .   but damn it i do n't hardly ever do anything nice for myself .   i deserve nice things . 
you do n't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day . 
yeah my luck .   i get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert . 
did you like it me watching you ? 
what ? 
depends on what you call love .   when i was growing up i had nothing .   i learned to want everything .   i wanted more than sierra anyway .  jake was my ticket .   he 's not much he 's older than me different than me but he 's got more money than half this town put together .   i courted him .   i let him think he was courtin' me but i reeled him in like a fish on a line .   i wanted him .   i wanted what he could give me and i would 've done anything to get him .   is that love ? 
whatever it takes . 
have you ever been there before ? 
beautiful .   beautiful beaches .   blue water and clear skies as far as you can see . 
take me with you . 
yeah a bird in a gilded cage . 
i  .   .   .  nothing .   just something he said .   so if the money 's in a safe we 'd have to get the combination
it 's not like he 's a young man .  he 's had time to live . 
i 've thought about you every second since i left .   i can still taste you on my lips . 
oh that 's great .   we killed jake because you heard him talk about some money that you 've never seen .  that 's fucking brilliant ! 
this is good .   this is real good .  this is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us .   they 'll probably just lock us up for being idiots . 
let him watch .   i want him to know what he 's missing . 
wait .   what about  .   .   .  him ? 
i got the money all packed .   i put the jeep in the garage .   figure that way people will think maybe me and jake went away .   might buy us some time . 
you killed him ! 
he was going to take the money . 
you killed a man for no reason ! 
i was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up . 
throw me the keys and i 'll pull you up . 
for christ 's sake john !   throw me the keys ! 
fuck you !   do you hear me john !  ?  fuck you !   john  .   .   .  john !  ? 
i  .   .  i was helping your wife .   i met her in town .   she needed a hand with her drapes .   that 's all . 
yeah i know .   more careful . 
john stewart . 
live there ? 
got work .   i know a man who 's got a boat .   wants me to sail it for him . 
wait a second
like you do n't know . 
hungry ? 
talk ?   about what ? 
i do . 
and what does that make you ? 
and for that you 'd kill grace ? 
i 'm not your boy jake .   i do n't like you and i do n't like what you are .   i got no choice but to do business with you .   this is just a nasty little marriage of convenience . 
what should i do ? 
i hate loving her .   i hate the kind of her person she is .   i hate having to tolerate the little games she plays .   i hate letting her use me .  but i love her too much to do otherwise .   and i certainly love her too much to kill her .   i could n't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull .   but you ?   you got the killing in you boy . 
you think that 's a lot of money ? 
i 'm doing what any man would do if he 'd been offended .   i 'm beating you up . 
you stupid punk !   you do n't even know what you 're fighting over ! 
let me guess .   this robber he gets your money . 
you 're the gambler .   you tell me . 
i had to beat it before the cops showed up .   i do n't have a cent to my name .   i ca n't even get my car out of the garage .   i tell you mr .  vesci if it were n't for bad luck i would n't have any at all .   so i was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fiftydollars so i could get my car .   i 'll pay it back with the rest of the money . 
jesus ! 
wish i could help sheriff .   but if you 'll excuse me i 'm going over to harlin's to pick up my car .   then i 'm getting the hell out of this place . 
and you 're taking ? 
but senor
yeah i want something .   i want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop . 
he 's only just dead .   what was i supposed to do with him ?   i ca n't take him away anywhere .   and nobody wants to take him for me .   do you ? 
or maybe you just think you do .  just another small town .  one guy chasing you .  you go big town .  just gonna have four guys after you instead .  kiss kissy kiss .  it gets down to one thing  are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing ?  cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can but wherever you go that 's where you gonna be . 
seems like i do but only cause end of the day we 're all eyes in the same head .  and everything is everything . 
well people gotta get by somehow .  that 's the curse .  the mines done it .  all that uranium plutonium fuffonium fuckononium assononium all that om !  everybody 's got a mother .  you do n't rip up your mother .  you do n't rip up the earth and take everything out .  it 's like the cracker jack box says the more you eat the more you want .  .  .  .  .  .  . 
difference between you and me old man is i see the glass half full you see it half empty . 
make time ?   is everybody in this town on drugs ? 
you expect me to believe that ? 
i do n't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone . 
fine .   i was making time with your girl .  now i 'm scared to death and i learned my lesson .  now can you go away ? 
easy chief .  i .  .  .  i was helping your wife .  i met her in town .   she needed a hand with her drapes .   that 's all . 
a lot that means . 
no i hate loving her .  i hate the kind of person she is .  i hate having to tolerate the little games she plays .  like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me .  the bitch .  she loved to play .  she wants me to hit her and when i hit her she likes it .  she tortures me .  but she 's family .  she 's my little girl .  my baby .  i could n't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull .  no .  not me .  but you ?  you got the killing in you boy .  .  . how much you want ? 
i need thirteen . 
i know you 're not surprised i 'm back here cause you can read my mind and all . 
 .  .  . and he thought he 'd clock old jake mckenna and turn his brains into wall paper .  .  . and then maybe borrow 200 or 20000 or 200000 .  .  . 
it 's the truth jake . 
oz . 
for what ? 
i was n't going to fight for you .   i was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend . 
that 's what i thought until you came riding in .   i saw your car over at the gas station .   it 's a cool car .   want to take me for a ride ?   desert 's kind of lonely this time of day . 
will you shut up ! 
nope .   darrell . 
but he 's dead . 
darrell
jesus .   twentyafterten and it must be ninety already . 
ninetytwo .   course half hour from now might be seventytwo .  these clouds move around a lot . 
no trouble at all really . 
you 're welcome grace . 
not until my car 's fixed .   i do n't know how long that 's going to take . 
i guess i 've got wander in my blood . 
where you headed ? 
i guess .   i 've got an ego same as any man . 
a little of this a little of that .   mostly i tell fortunes . 
a medicine man ? 
what ? 
nothing like a little liveliness . 
is that why you 're with him ? 
you could leave him . 
it 's not that easy .   maybe you can take chances maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please .   i ca n't .  i do n't want to be alone .   i need to know i 'm going to be taken care of . 
is that so bad ?   it 's not like i would n't try to make him happy .   for awhile anyway .  i mean i would  .  .  .  do things for him .   i guess i 'm no good that way .   i guess i tried to sucker you along like that .   do you hate me for it ?   i would n't blame you if you did .   but maybe it 's like you said you just got to do whatever it takes to get out . 
nothing . 
do n't feel like nothing . 
grace i 've been fucked over too many times by too many women .   you 're becoming the queen of hot and cold . 
you 'd never understand . 
yeah .  what do you want .  life right ?   have you ever been to california ? 
honey baby i uca n'tu .  i ca n't even get out of here umyselfu .  believe it or not i need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic .  .  . 
jake hides it .  in a safe .  in the floor .  in the bedroom .  he counts it .  he loves to sit there and count it . 
i do n't think we have anything to talk about . 
i could if i had jake 's money . 
you do n't know what it feels like to be free of that place . 
ca n't we just dump him fast someplace ? 
we 're going to buy a boat of our own baby and sail it wherever we want to go . 
he was in love with you grace .  he would 've done what you wanted you could 've made a deal and  .  .  . 
you could give me my gun back . 
son .   little excitement out at the reservation this morning .  wayne and dale elkhart were up drinking all night and then wayne starts chasing dale around the desert with his shotgun .  bia handled it .  i went by for backup . 
yeah fell down and hit a rock .  not as bad as it looks . 
sounds like it .  i wish i could help sheriff but i just want to get my car and get on up the road . 
arkady
with a ushotgunu !   she kills ubothu of em and .  .  .  and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces .  not one bill is left alive .   i mean what are the odds ? 
you know how that toby is .   thinks every man he sees is after his jenny . 
you did n't hear something ? 
yes . 
oh shit .  .  . 
i was hoping you would call me but .  .  .  anyway i decided not to wait .   i was thinking it might be nice to go to dinner together . 
not often but it is possible .  most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits .  they do n't know how long the shadow really is .  they do n't know how far away the real limits are standing .  .  .  they stop out of fear . 
you use your sleeve . 
it 's finished .  i won . 
skeptical about what ? 
in college .  a car accident . 
we 've already begun . 
you thought he was carrying a knife ? 
or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants . 
i never said you could n't be killed .  i never said that . 
there 's nothing to do . 
no . 
no jeremy . 
all of it . 
i 'm not scared . 
you 're lying . 
i 'm meeting a player from temple university .  he 's a cornerback .  you like football ? 
that 's what i said to my son .  he said there 's always two kinds .  the soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands and then there 's the real threat .  the brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind . 
in the passenger car ? 
no . 
any way fate stepped in and took football out of the equation . 
you ca n't do anything about that .  you might fall between that chair and this television .  if that 's what god has planned for you that 's what 's going to happen .  you ca n't hide from it in your room . 
hell yeah .  a bunch of us bar t boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own .  we come across this fucker on a roan goin' south an' .  .  . 
uh .  .  .  a little maybe .

maybe you should .  .  .  hang the carpenter . 
he 's .  .  .  he 's dead . 
nno .  he .  .  .  he beat him up .  he was making him .  .  .  answer questions .  .  .  and beating him up .  .  .  and then .  .  .  ned just died .   little bill did n't mean to kill him .  .  .  he said he was sorry an' all .  .  .  but he said it was a good example anyhow . 
what 'd ned say ? 
i could of .  .  .  easy .

been gone near three years now . 
he 's my partner .  he do n't go i do n't . 
he ai n't dead ?  you did n't get him ? 
he 's in there . 
yeah . 
oh chchchrist .  .  .  it do n't .  .  .  it do n't seem .  .  .  real .  .  .  how he 's .  .  .  dead .  .  .  how he ai n't gonna breathe no more .  .  .  nnnever .  or the other one neither .  .  .  on account of .  .  .  of just .  .  .  pullin' a trigger . 
well you do n't wanna trust me too much .  we 'll take ned his share together so you do n't figure i run off with it . 
cut up a woman .  cut her eyes out cut her tits off cut her fingers off .  .  .  done everythin' but cut up her cunny i guess . 
two more hogs got the fever . 
three . 
the one you rode out after .  .  .  the one that had the pistol .  .  . 
only he was n't carryin' no pistol this time . 
well i gotta know what kind of fellas i 'm ridin' with do n't i ?  in case of a scrape . 
he ai n't as tough as you kid . 
maybe . 
you mean am i gonna help you kill them cowboys ? 
he says the hair is longer and lighter . 
edie please .  i do n't want to hear this right now .  what did renault and fortier say ? 
i hope i did n't disturb you . 
i do n't want to know . 
what do you care what he says ? 
you were waiting for a lineup then too .  what happened with that ? 
i did you a favor by standing up for you last night but do n't think we 're friends .  i 'm sorry but i have other things 
okay okay .  you say it 's the real thing ?  that 's cool . 
you okay ? 
not if we do it my way . 
what time is it ? 
you know damn well deadman . 
i told the d . a .  everything i know . 
oh come on verbal .  who do you think you 're talking to ?  you really expect me to believe he retired ?  for a woman ?  bullshit .  he was using her . 
you got him wrong . 
so why play into his hands ?  we can protect you . 
gee thanks dave .  bangup job so far .  extortion coercion .  you 'll pardon me if i ask you to kiss my pucker .  the same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me they 'll bail me out ?  fuck you .  you think you can catch keyser soze ?  you think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out ?  if he comes up for anything it will be to get rid of me .   after that my guess is you 'll never hear from him again . 
oh but it 's not .  if i had n't been nailed in illinois for running a three card monte in between sets i never would have took off for new york .  i never would have met keaton see .  that barber shop quartet was the reason for everything . 
what call ? 
then why did n't you help him ? 
his own people were selling him to a gang of hungarians .  most likely the same hungarians that sate all but wiped out back in turkey .  the money was n't there for dope .  the hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger soze for them . 
but how  wait .  you 're saying soze sent                  t us to kill someone ? 
is he keyser soze i do n't know verbal .  it seems to me that keyser sate is a shield .  like you said a spook story but i know keaton  and someone out there is pulling strings for you .  stay here and let us protect you . 
you posted twenty minutes ago .  captain leo wants you out of here a . s . a . p .  unless you turn state 's . 
abrams .  .  .

bullshit it 's not accesory .  i did n't do shit .  you call the cops you explain it was an accident .  .  . 
that 's a horrible ugly comment .  dead whore ?  she 's a person ! 
what 's that ? 
i did n't hear you . 
no because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about which makes 85 of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me . 
why ?  ! 
you have acquaintances  business friends and superficial golf buddies .  you have always been a fringe player .  you have some serious male on male intimacy problems . 
go home ! 
you do n't know what you 're doing . 
what do you think you are doing ? 
just wait a second .  wait one second .  okay .  what are you doing ? 
why ? 
listen to me .  please .  everybody just calm down a bit here .  okay .  .  .  first .  .  . are we sure she 's dead ? 
her head 's bashed in and her heart is n't beating . 
that is not an option .  there is no multiple choice here . 
have you ever done this before ? 
we 've already done this . 
well what the fuck are we supposed to do ? 
lighten up adam .  show some character . 
they 're screaming like monsters and it 's giving me a headache .  go get some fucking starbursts . 
then fuck what your father said cause i 'm gonna tell you right now .  .  . you 'll know what it 's all about why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning and the streetlight 's coming through the window and it 's just catching a corner of her face like a sleeping angel .  and her hair smells sweet and she 's your 's .  she 's all your 's .  do you see where i 'm going here ? 
y 'see ?  that 's the real point here .  that 's what i 'm driving for when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave 's are bare .  what 's left ?  the little trees the little fellas that the storm did n't see .  the tiny little .  .  . 
left side . 
we can take her out to red rock .  find some quiet place .  .  . and put her in the ground . 
i 'm calling the police . 
go ahead . 
he is not cracking up . 
what did you ask me ? 
i said what have we done ? 
what ? 
exactly !  exactly my point . 
you want to know what you are doing here ?  !  you are love pumping .  you are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies .  you are walking the walk .  this is it fisher the real stuff .  you love this woman .  love is second to nothing .  i love you .  i love moore .  i love micheal .  this car is full of love and nothing  absolutely nothing  supersedes love man .  nothing .  we will do what it takes .  whatever it takes . 
yeah . 
hear what ? 
you 've got a warped thought process .  your brain does n't function properly . 
you want some breakfast meat .  micheal .  is that what you want ? 
ca n't we do it on the phone ? 
i do n't think so .

no micheal did .  it was an accident . 
micheal by accident . 
stop !  you stop right here .  i do n't want to know anymore .  i told you not to do this bachelor party thing .  you were warned . 
no buts .  i told you your friends were jackasses . 
no buts .  i 've waited twentyseven years twentyseven years i have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle .  i will not be derailed !  i will not be embarrassed !  i will not be denied !  i am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water ! 
did she believe you ? 
did he try to kiss you ? 
yeah .  i 'm thinking about micheal 's franco harris fixation .  you know how micheal was always harping immaculate reception ?  i 've seen that play .  a lot of times .  .  . and i have to say this .  .  .  franco was lucky .  flat out right place right time .  that 's it .  he was where the ball bounced .  you get me ? 
i want a black one .  a little black brother .  that 's a big problem it seems to me .  lack of racial integration .  that 's a big one .  you think ? 
we 're in no hurry .  i think we 'll take some time to enjoy each other enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids . 
so where to on the honeymoon ? 
well i just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so i can get the ball rolling . 
i killed my brother ! 
i do n't think that 's a good idea . 
no the children sleep with me . 
then it 's a respectable house .

gordon i worked at bluestar i know my way around i have friends there .  .  . inside . 
a pleasure to meet you mr .  fox . 
if these people lose their jobs nowhere to go .  my father worked at bluestar for twentyfour years .  i gave em my word . 
oh yes i remember you . 
destiny took us apart but i knew it would bring us back together . 
not really .  i 'd say that gordon is one of the most astute collectors around .  he has a great eye and he only buys the best .  like this rug for instance a silk tabriz the finest of its kind .  the day after he bought it in london a dealer representing the saudi royal family offered him twice what he paid .  it absolutely makes the room .  see how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa .  .  .  although .  .  .   i do n't know if i would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery  too dingy .  and it 's a sacrilege having that precolumbian pot in the center of the coffee table .  some dope might use it as an ashtray . 
you really do believe in destiny ? 
well why stop at that ? 
 .  .  . too perfect .  .  . let 's not even eat .  let 's just watch it and think about it .  
you 're so naive bud you do n't even know .  your dad took care of you .  i might 've been rich when i was a kid .  .  . but my father lost all his money .  .  . in the seventies in the stock market at the track .  he was a lousy gambler .  .  . 
buddy it 's not your fault and it 's not your decision . 
he still likes you

are they okay ? 
look ted .  i 'm cool with everything .  you 've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town .  you 've always had an itch for the good life .  i 'm happy for you .  this could n't happen to a nicer guy . 
i have absolutely no intention
but you tripledogdared me . 
in the sense that there is no hidden agenda behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs . 
i 'm trying to help . 
i 'm still better than you .  nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account . 
funny you should say peachy . 
i did my homework .  your grandfather was a peach farmer . 
undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort . 
second only to unbridled narcissistic conceit . 
put your eyeballs back in your head william randolph .  i 'm on assignment .  a girl has to fit in . 
but you never do . 
you expected whips chains merk being cattleprodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood ? 
my desire betrays me like goosebumps on my flesh . 
you live and learn .  i realized the most important thing to me above all is trust . 
aw julie it 's my job .  it 's like being a doctor . 
which explains the continued success of heaven for how many decades ? 
you seem like you 're anything but lazy uncle billy . 
i never finished school myself .  never had to .  my brother built this empire from nothing but his wife 's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption .  he gave me a cushy job on a silver platter .  i never struggled for a second . 
what kind of ideas ? 
i wish i knew you years ago when my brother was alive .  i wish he never gave you up . 
kelly van ryan .  .  . 
she still work there ? 
she had it before she drank herself to death .   was n't exactly a love child .  .  . 
suzie .   then you 're not her grandmother .  .  . 
you mean he withdrew .  .  . 
i know one thing he said .   it was when .  .  .  when he took himself out and was standing up .   he said do n't worry i did n't come .  i ca n't forget that .   he said no little girl can ever make me come . 
hunter 's making it our job because sandra van ryan's got a bug up his ass .  you know that as well as i do .   we 're gonna trash this guy 's life and i keep asking myself if it 's really necessary . 
you 're telling me you believe the guy ? 
yeah well van ryan got his .   i do n't imagine he gives a shit now . 
lombardo 's settlement ? 
you got it .   the rich got richer .   while the saps like lombardo went bellyup in the swamp . 
what if i 'm right gloria ?   what if i 'm right and hunter 's wrong ?   what do you do if you see a bad thing coming ? 
and if the teeth are n't suzie 's ?   you 'll give this up ? 
yeah maybe a little . 
i 'm sorry ? 
yeah but he ca n't push you around like he can me .   you 've got family and they 've got clout .   with we it 's different .  .  .  with me .  .  . 
i 'm scared that 's what .   i 'm scared there 's no one to trust . 
i 'm not on your property ! 
you notice my new jumper ? 
do it to ourselves ? 
we have to stick with the plan . 
okay .   i want you to hear this too .  we 've got to be cool .   all of us .  people think i 'm rich for christ 's sake .    i 'm doing what rich guys do .   i 'm spending my money .   it 's more suspicious if i sit around doing nothing .   now do n't let this cop fuck with your minds . 
what 's that supposed to mean ? 
for you to be getting this kind of heat for what they have on you .  .  .  it does n't add up .   sandra van ryan's got em running scared .   and i 'll tell you something else you rush you get careless . 
hey ray .   guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and sam 's ? 
yes . 
come off it man .  .  .  it was an accident . 
yes aha .   a brass screw . 
is this leading somewhere ? 
what about the explosive ? 
quite .   come let 's mingle . 
then we 've got our proof .  excellent .   and where do we find this fortunate scientist ? 
come on jim .   i 'm serious .   dot .  .  .   dash .   it 'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it . 
that ?   oh it 's a kind of chinese fighting .  .  .  i was sort of caught once with a lovely chinese girl out in san francisco .   her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  i 've got a book on it if you 're interested . 
uh .  .  .  how long ago was this ? 
sure .   it 's a windup .  .  .  thing . 
you 'd think if loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen . 
sounds like a train .   looks like a train . 
relax .   we 're almost there . 
i know !   i know ! 
i do n't have to tell you what that would do to our careers ! 
oh well then let 's kick some ass ! 
well sure .   did n't you get your orders ? 
but it only has six legs . 
i get that feeling .   you know mr .  tyler i 'm the kind of woman who does n't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time .  but after spying you across the room i 'm tempted to suspend my disbelief at least for the evening . 
really ? 
forgive me but you do n't strike me as the social secretary type . 
yes sir . 
part of some speech they wrote for this trip i 'm taking . 
on my way to denver .  .  .

when word gets out that zenovitch was a cop all hell will break lose .  you 've got 24 hours .  that 's all i can give you .  24 hours on your own .  after that the case and the witness go back to the homicide department .

the neurofilter acts like a surge protector regulating the infinite flow of information from cerebro to the professor 's mind .   it 's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions .
